        "content": "Marc Robert Lamont, better known as Caedrel, is a British professional League of Legends coach, currently head coach for Los Ratones. He is also a content creator, streamer, retired professional League of Legends player and sports commentator for Riot Games. Known for holding co-streams of major professional League of Legends regions and international competitions, Caedrel is considered as one of the biggest streamers within the game's community, mostly known for his in-depth gameplay analysis and familiarity.\nOn the livestreaming platform Twitch, Caedrel operates the biggest channel on the League of Legends category and constantly ranks among the top streamers in the English language according to Streams Charts.\nCaedrel is also known for his time as a caster in the League of Legends EMEA Championship and has cast several major international tournaments, including the final of the 2022 League of Legends World Championship.\n\nProfessional career\nCaedrel began his professional career in May 2015, joining xPerience eSports Club as their midlaner until July of the same year. Following a brief stint with now-defunct Team ALTERNATE (then known as ALTERNATE aTTaX), he joined Giants Gaming as their substitute midlaner until the end of the year. In January 2016, Lamont signed with Renegades Banditos in the European Challenger Series. After the disbandment of Renegades' League of Legends roster in May 2016 due to several issues, Caedrel then joined multiple teams for the rest of the year.\n\nJoining H2k and promotion to EU LCS (2017–2018)\nIn 2017, Caedrel joined H2k-Gaming as a substitute. He would then return to the team as part of their main roster after a four-month stint with Schalke 04 Esports where they would place second in the EUCS Summer Split. This period was where Caedrel would also earn his first promotion to the European League Championship Series (now League of Legends EMEA Championship) with a 3–0 win over Ninjas in Pyjamas on 25 August 2017. The following year, Caedrel returned to H2k, now as a jungler, and participated in his first EU LCS split, where they would finish with an 8–10 win-loss record, make the quarterfinals where they were defeated by Team Vitality in five games. However, he would spend most of this period as a substitute. In the Summer Split, H2k would finish with a 2–16 record, with two of those wins featuring Caedrel as the starting jungler.\n\nExcel Esports and retirement from professional play (2019–2020)\nOn 2 December 2018, Caedrel joined Excel Esports as their main jungler, where they would finish 9th and 10th in the Spring and Summer Splits, respectively, during the 2019 LEC season. Following another disappointing season in 2020, Caedrel announced his retirement from professional play through a video posted to Twitter (now X).\n\nPost-professional play\nCasting and analyst desk (2020–2023)\nWhilst still being a player, Caedrel had his first game as a caster in a game between his former team Schalke 04 Esports and Fnatic on 31 January 2020. He also served as a caster and analyst in that year's European Masters, LEC Summer Split Playoffs, and the play-in stage of the 2020 League of Legends World Championship. These casting stints were met with widespread praise, leading to his selection as an on-air talent for the 2021 LEC season.\nCaedrel was part of the casting and analyst lineup for three LEC seasons (2021, 2022, and 2023). He also cast the 2021 and 2022 editions of the League of Legends World Championship and the 2021 Mid-Season Invitational. Caedrel cast his final international game during the 2022 edition of Worlds, when he was selected as one of the casters for the tournament's final at the Chase Center in San Francisco, United States alongside Clayton \"CaptainFlowers\" Raines and Sam \"Kobe\" Hartman-Kenzler. In the fifth and deciding game of the said matchup between T1 and DRX, Caedrel gained the attention of viewers for his reaction to T1's Lee \"Gumayusi\" Min-hyeong's steal of the Baron Nashor using the Varus, through an utterance of an expletive and with the phrase, \"Guma can he steal it\". The phrase has since become synonymous with him and the said game.\nFollowing the 2023 LEC season, Caedrel announced his retirement from casting to focus on streaming full-time, with the season finals between G2 Esports and Fnatic at the Sud de France Arena in Montpellier, France being his last as a caster and analyst.\n\nFull-time streaming and other ventures (2023–present)\nDuring his time as a pro-player and caster, Caedrel was already venturing into streaming on his Twitch channel, but the 2023 League of Legends World Championship in South Korea marked his first tournament as a full-time streamer. It was during this tournament where three videos on his YouTube channel would reach at least one million views as of October 2024. His highest viewed video as of the said time was 2 million for a video of his co-stream highlights of the tournament's semifinal matchup between T1 and JD Gaming. Caedrel was also selected as an onsite co-streamer for the tournament's finals between T1 and Weibo Gaming at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, serving as one of two co-streamers from the EMEA region alongside Ibai Llanos.\nCaedrel joined Fnatic in January 2024 to be one of their content creators and streamers, where he also became their official co-streamer during the 2024 LEC season. He parted ways with the organization on 14 December 2024. \nIn 2024, Caedrel co-streamed the Spring and Summer Splits of the LCK, LPL, LEC, & LCS (now called the LTA North), the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational and the 2024 League of Legends World Championship. Co-streaming the latter tournament virtually and in-person on three occassions, including the Final between Bilibili Gaming and T1 at The O2 Arena in London, he was both the most-watched co-streamer during the tournament with a peak viewership of 372 thousand, which is the highest in his channel's history, and the most-watched English language stream in the entire World Championship. Caedrel also achieved the highest number of hours watched for a co-streamer in the event at 17.02 million, making up 19.4% of the total hours watched of the entire tournament at 87.5 million, taking into account the official Riot Games stream and other co-streams.\nOn 31 October 2024, two days before the 2024 World Championship Final, Caedrel officially reached one million followers on his Twitch channel. \nFor the 2025 competitive calendar, Caedrel currently co-streams the 2025 LCK and LEC seasons, as well as select games from the 2025 LPL season. He is also expected to co-stream all three international tournaments, namely First Stand, MSI, and the World Championship.\n\nLeague Awards\nOn 12 June 2024, Caedrel and his former on-air broadcast colleague Eefje \"Sjokz\" Depoortere announced the creation of the \"League Awards,\" a League of Legends-oriented awards show aimed at celebrating the game's esports scene and recognizing outstanding players during each competitive season. The first edition of the event took place on 5 December 2024 in Berlin, Germany, with Caedrel and Sjokz serving as hosts.\n\nLos Ratones\nDuring a livestream on his Twitch channel on 1 June 2024, Caedrel first brought up the idea of competing in the Northern League of Legends Championship (NLC) alongside Tim \"Nemesis\" Lipovšek and Simon \"Thebausffs\" Hofverberg. Five months later, Caedrel announced on 15 November 2024 that he would be starting a professional team called \"Los Ratones\", with Nemesis and Thebausffs joining the organization as its midlaner and toplaner, respectively. They would be joined by jungler Veljko \"Velja\" Čamdžić, ADC Juš \"Crownie\" Marušič, and support Carl Martin Erik \"Rekkles\" Larsson, with Caedrel serving as head coach of the team. \nThe name, \"Los Ratones\" first emerged in the \"CaedrelPlays\" YouTube Channel on 17 September 2023 in a first of a series of videos of him playing \"Teamfight Manager,\" an esports manager game available on digital distribution platform Steam, when he typed \"Los Ratones\" as the name for his team on the game. On 2 January 2025, it was announced that the team would be competing in the Northern League of Legends Championship (NLC).\n\nAwards and nominations\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hasan Doğan Piker ( PY-kər; Turkish: [haˈsan doˈan piˈcæɾ]; born July 25, 1991), also known as HasanAbi, is a Turkish-American online streamer, YouTuber, influencer, and left-wing political commentator. His streams typically consist of political and social commentary, gaming, and media consumption. As of 2024, Piker is the fifth-most-subscribed channel on the streaming platform Twitch.\n\nEarly life and education\nHasan Piker was born to Turkish parents in New Brunswick, New Jersey, but grew up in Istanbul and was raised as a Muslim. His father's family emigrated to Turkey from Thessaloniki and Crete, Greece. His father, Mehmet Behçet Piker, is a political scientist and economist who served on the Board of Directors (and as Vice President) of Sabancı Holding, and who is a founding member of the Future Party in Turkey. His mother, Ülker Sedef Piker, (née Uygur) is an art and architectural historian teaching at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. His uncle Cenk Uygur is a political commentator and co-founder of The Young Turks news network. Piker says he was bullied in public school in Turkey for his lack of physical fitness and for questioning Islam.\nPiker returned to the United States and attended the University of Miami, then transferred to Rutgers University, where he graduated cum laude with a double major in political science and communication studies in 2013.\n\nCareer\nThe Young Turks\nDuring his senior year of college in 2013, Piker interned for The Young Turks (TYT), a progressive news show and network co-founded by his uncle, Cenk Uygur. After graduating, Piker was hired by the network's ad sales and business department. He asked to host the show when a fill-in was needed and later became a host and producer.\nIn 2016, Piker created and hosted The Breakdown, a TYT Network video series which aired on Facebook and presented left-leaning political analyses targeted, at the time, at millennial supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The show was nominated for \"Best Web Series\" at the 10th Shorty Awards in 2018. Piker also contributed political content to HuffPost from 2016 to 2018.\nPiker created and hosted another TYT series in 2019, Agitprop with Hasan Piker. In January 2020, he announced his departure from TYT and his intention to focus on his career as a Twitch streamer.\n\nTwitch\nPiker started streaming on Twitch in March 2018 while working at TYT. Piker has said he shifted his attention from Facebook to Twitch in order to reach a younger audience and because of what he felt was a preponderance of right-wing commentators on YouTube and a lack of leftist representation among streamers. He became a popular left-wing political commentator, and was invited to appear on KTTV's The Issue Is and the political podcast Chapo Trap House. His YouTube channel features highlights of his streams, and in 2022 reached over 1,000,000 subscribers. Piker also streams gameplay and commentary of video games on his Twitch channel. Sometimes Piker will role-play as \"Hank Pecker\", a caricature of a right-wing redneck.\n\nComments on Dan Crenshaw and 9/11 and temporary ban\nDuring a Twitch stream on August 20, 2019, Piker mocked U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw, a SEAL Team 3 veteran who served in Afghanistan, for his support of American military interventionism overseas. Piker said of Crenshaw, \"What the fuck is wrong with this dude? Didn't he go to war and like, literally lose his eye because some mujahideen, a brave fucking soldier, fucked his eye-hole with their dick?\", adding that Crenshaw \"deserved\" his fate.\nIn the same stream, Piker criticized American foreign policy and made controversial comments relating to the September 11, 2001, attacks, including \"America deserved 9/11.\" His statements caused outrage on social media and were covered by Fox News and various other media outlets. Crenshaw said that Piker's comments were a \"disgusting defense of the 9/11 terrorist attacks against Americans.\" In response, Piker described his comments as satirical and cited American foreign policy as promoting conditions to make an event like 9/11 possible, but acknowledged that he should have used \"more precise\" language. Twitch banned Piker for one week due to the comments.\n\n2020 US presidential election, January 6 attack and 2024 US presidential election\nOn October 19, 2020, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez collaborated with Piker and fellow Twitch streamer Pokimane to organize a stream of the Representative playing the popular multiplayer game Among Us for the \"Get out the vote\" initiative for the upcoming presidential election. The stream aired the following day, featuring both Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar playing the game with Piker and other popular Twitch streamers, reaching a total concurrent viewership of almost 700,000.\nDuring the first 2020 United States presidential debate on September 29, Piker had over 125,000 viewers watching his commentary of the broadcast, the highest viewership of the debate on Twitch. Piker's stream covering the results of the 2020 United States presidential election peaked at 230,000 concurrent viewers and was the sixth most-watched source of election coverage across YouTube and Twitch, comprising 4.9% of the market share. He was the most watched Twitch streamer during the election week; his 80 hours of streams were viewed for a cumulative 6.8 million hours by an average of 75,000 concurrent viewers. Piker's stream reached a new high of 231,000 viewers during the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Piker's 2024 election night coverage stream had 7.5 million total viewers.\n\n2021 temporary ban for using \"cracker\" and later activities\nOn December 13, 2021, Piker was banned from Twitch for one week for using the racial epithet \"cracker\" repeatedly on stream. Piker argued the term should not be considered a slur against white people since a person using it is \"powerless\" and \"doing it as someone who has been historically oppressed blowing off steam.\" He further contended \"cracker\" is not a slur in the same way as other terms, stating that \"It's something I've talked about so many times because it's like white boys love fucking saying, 'Cracker is the same as the n-word,' It's really stupid. The etymology of the word is different. ... It comes from 'whip cracker.' So the power is still in the hands of the white person in that situation, whereas the n-word is dehumanizing.\"  An August 2023 paper in New Media & Society criticized Twitch for punishing Piker while epithets aimed minority groups were prevalent on the platform. The paper also criticized the subsequent commentary defending Twitch's decision as falsely equating \"cracker\" with other racial epithets.\n\nCoverage of the Gaza war\nPiker has regularly spoken about the Gaza war by advocating for Palestinians and criticizing the Israeli government.\nIn January 2024, Piker interviewed a Yemeni self-proclaimed \"pirate\" who had filmed himself on board the Galaxy Leader, a Bahamas-flagged ship that has been held captive by Houthi militants since November 2023.\nIn November 2024, congressman Ritchie Torres criticized Twitch for alleged \"amplification of antisemitism\", specifically calling for an investigation into Piker. Piker defended himself, arguing that he did not criticize Jewish people as a whole and was only anti-Zionist. A campaign by pro-Israeli advocates, including the streamer Destiny, pressured advertisers to leave Twitch due to the platforming of alleged antisemitism, including Piker's political commentary of the conflict. Both the pressure campaign and Ritchie Torres posted clips of Piker's channel they alleged to be antisemitic. Piker refuted the charge, arguing the clips were taken out of context. Because of the controversy, some advertisers have pulled advertisements.\n\n2025 comments on Rick Scott and temporary ban\nIn March 2025, Piker received a one-day ban from Twitch after stating during a stream, \"If you cared about Medicare fraud or Medicaid fraud, you would kill Rick Scott, okay?\", while reacting to remarks made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson regarding Medicare and Medicaid waste. Piker apologized on social media, clarifying that he should have stated that if Johnson genuinely cared about Medicaid fraud, he would seek the \"max punishment\" for Scott, who had committed the \"most Medicare fraud in [American] history.\" This was a reference to Scott's history of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.\n\nFundraisers\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Piker, in partnership with CARE, raised over $200,000 for Ukrainian relief funds while playing Elden Ring, with an average of over 70,000 people watching his coverage of the conflict.\nIn the aftermath of the February 6, 2023, Turkey–Syria earthquake, Piker organized a fundraiser that was also contributed to and promoted by other streamers and content creators including Jacksepticeye, Valkyrae, Ludwig Ahgren and IShowSpeed. As of February 10, the fundraiser had raised over $1,200,000 for charities such as CARE International's Turkish and Syrian branches as well as two Turkish NGOs: the AKUT Search and Rescue Association, and Ahbap, which was founded by Turkish musician Haluk Levent.\nDuring the Israel–Hamas war, Piker's charity drive on his channel raised over $1,000,000, as of October 21, 2023, for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, American Near East Refugee Aid, Medical Aid for Palestinians, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.\n\nOther ventures\nSince 2021, Piker has hosted the podcast Fear& (formerly Fear&Malding) alongside his friend and fellow Twitch streamer, Will Neff. Streamers QTCinderella and AustinShow would later join the podcast as co-hosts in 2023. From September 26, 2021, to October 12, 2023, Piker co-hosted the left-leaning political podcast Leftovers with co-host Ethan Klein. On November 8, 2021, Piker released a line of union-made merchandise called Ideologie and donated a portion of the proceedings to strike funds in which he raised over $180,000.\n\nPolitical views\nPiker's content has been identified as a progressive, leftist, and socialist. He has advocated in favor of workplace democracy, universal health care, intersectional feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, anti-Zionism and gun control.\nPiker has cited his upbringing in Turkey under the Premiership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as an influence on both his left-wing views and willingness to speak out about them. Piker supported the presidential primary campaigns of Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020, and has been an outspoken critic of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Piker opposed Donald Trump's travel ban in 2017.\n\nReception\nPiker has been described as Twitch's \"de facto political commentator\" who uses an unabashedly ideological framing. Outlets dedicated to video game culture and youth culture have covered Piker's streams positively. In particular, journalists have noted his ability to \"combine information and entertainment,\" and to approach left-wing political coverage in a way that is relatable and accessible to Twitch viewers, who may feel out of touch with cable news. Some authors also cite Piker's vulgar, animated style of expression and his physical appearance as notable factors behind his popularity.\nIn July 2024, Alex Mahadevan of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, cited Piker as an example of the \"online chattering class\" who do not hold themselves to journalistic ethics, in contrast to their peers in traditional media. A September 2024 article in the academic journal Digital Journalism discussed a similar theme, characterizing Piker as emblematic of an emerging \"Newsfluencers\" class (influencers who mainly cover news) with a tendency towards \"problematic behavior\" that conflicted with journalistic objectivity. In April 2024, the same journal noted that Piker is familiar with journalistic mechanics such as sourcing, framing, and objectivity, but rejects these as methods used for \"manufacturing consent for elites\". Instead, Piker mainly sources his information from social media, often supplied to him by his audience.  \nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Piker apologized for insisting in the prelude that Russia would not attack. \"[I] didn't think a regional power would act so irrationally. I've admitted my mistakes. I got things wrong,\" stated Piker. The Washington Post has also categorized Piker as a news-based influencer who does not feel bound to journalistic objectivity.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2021, Piker purchased a $2.7 million house in West Hollywood, California.\n\nAwards and nominations\nGaming website Kotaku selected Piker as one of their \"Gamers of the Year\" for 2020, citing him as a major figure in the mainstreaming of political commentary on Twitch, a platform which in the past was seen as discouraging to political discussion. Piker won a Streamy in the News category at the 10th annual awards in 2020 and was nominated again in the same category for the 2021 event. In 2022, Piker was nominated in the categories News, Just Chatting, and Streamer of the Year, winning the News award for the second time and being nominated for three consecutive years. At the event, he also presented the Creator of the Year award alongside Avani Gregg, which was won by MrBeast for the third year in a row. At the 2023 Streamer Awards, Piker was nominated for Best Just Chatting Streamer and Streamer of the Year, winning the former.\n\nFilmography\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nHasanAbi on Twitch\nHasanAbi's channel on YouTube\n Media related to Hasan Piker at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "FaZe Clan, or simply FaZe, is a professional esports and entertainment brand. Founded on May 30, 2010, as FaZe Sniping, the organization has professional players and content creators from around the world, across multiple games.\nIn October 2023, an agreement was announced for FaZe Clan's parent company FaZe Holdings to be acquired by GameSquare in an all stock deal. In May 2024, GameSquare announced the formation of a new company, FaZe Media, led by Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson. This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an esports company, and an internet media company.\n\nHistory\nFaZe Sniping made its debut on YouTube on May 30, 2010. Originally, the group were a Call of Duty clan founded by three players, Eric \"CLipZ\" Rivera, Jeff \"House Cat\" Emann (now known as \"Timid\") and Ben \"Resistance\" Christensen. The trio garnered a reputation for innovating trickshotting in the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Their YouTube content took off when Ted \"Fakie\" joined the clan. It was then when FaZe unveiled the most popular series on their channel, ILLCAMS. FaZe Clan's focus on trickshotting and a personality-driven approach to social media led to FaZe Clan becoming one of the first popular YouTube video game channels, compared to other Call of Duty channels which often focused solely on winning tournaments. In 2012, the channel had one million subscribers, and the clan began to branch out into esports competitions. Teams under the FaZe name began competing in competitions such as the Call of Duty Championship and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships, who were separate from the clan's YouTube content creators, splitting members of FaZe Clan into two mostly autonomous camps. Originally, FaZe Clan did not have a corporate structure, however the original CEO was Thomas \"Temperrr\" Oliveira, who had been a member of FaZe since he was 16 years old. Oliveira and COO Richard “Banks” Bengtson created the first FaZe shared home in 2014 in Plainview, New York, intended to facilitate lifestyle content alongside their gaming content.\nIn 2015, former social media platform Hubrick, run by Norwegian entrepreneur Sebastian Geurts, invested in FaZe Clan. Hubrick recruited former record executive Lee Trink to act as an advisor. In January 2016, FaZe Clan acquired European esports team G2 Esports's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive international lineup, who competed as FaZe Clan in the 2016 MLG Major Championship: Columbus, The team won second place in ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018, losing to US-based Cloud9. In 2017, Bengtson moved to Los Angeles, starting a new shared home with YouTubers called the Clout House. FaZe Clan were the runners up in ESL Pro League Season 6 in 2017, and second runners up of ESL Pro League Season 7 and ESL One Cologne 2018. FaZe Clan were the champions of ELeague CS:GO Premier in 2017, winning $500,000 of prize money.\nIn 2018, Greg Selkoe, founder of streetware web retailer Karmaloop, became the president of FaZe Clan, with Trink becoming the CEO. In late 2018, FaZe Clan opened its series A funding round. Throughout 2019, musicians Ray J, DJ Paul, Offset, Swae Lee, Yo Gotti, Pitbull, and Disco Fries, basketball players Meyers Leonard, Josh Hart, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, footballer Gregory van der Wiel, skateboarder Nyjah Huston, radio host Big Boy, music executives Sylvia Rhone, Troy Carter and Guy Oseary and actor Chris O'Donnell invested in FaZe Clan. In December 2019, FaZe closed its series A led by entrepreneur Jimmy Iovine and mobile e-commerce platform NTWRK.\nIn January 2020, FaZe Clan obtained a $22.7 million investment loan from a private lender. FaZe was advised on the transaction by Canaccord Genuity, a Canadian financial company. On June 18, 2020, FaZe Clan announced its co-ownership of CTRL, a food supplement company. In December 2020, FaZe Clan was worth $305 million. That same month the revenue of FaZe Clan was estimated $40 million. It also released the film Crimson under FaZe Studios in 2020, with Brian \"Rug\" Awadis in a leading role.\nOn June 10, 2021, FaZe Clan became the first esports team to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The same year, a merger was announced with special purpose acquisition investors B. Riley Principal to become a public company listed on NASDAQ, with an expected initial valuation of about $1 billion. As part of this merge, FaZe would receive $291 million from B. Riley, and would be renamed to Faze Holdings Inc. and refocus itself as a brand for \"the voice of youth culture\". The merger was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the company went public on July 20, 2022, however with a lower than announced valuation of $725 million. Also in 2021, FaZe Clan member Frazier Khattrri (FaZe Kay) would become one of the lead promoters of Save the Kids token, a pump and dump cryptocurrency which was additionally promoted by FaZe members Jarvis, Teeqo and Nikan. Upon the token's launch and revelation to the public that it was a pump and dump, FaZe removed Kay and suspended Jarvis, Teeqo, and Nikan for their involvement.\nIn July 2022, FaZe Clan became a publicly traded company. The company had only received a portion of the money they were promised by private investors ahead of their merge with B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Group. On January 20, 2023, the price of their stock fell below one dollar for the first time, which put them at risk of being delisted. According to Nasdaq policy, if a company's stock is under one dollar for more than a month, the company will receive a deficiency notice, in which they have 180 days for the stock to be one dollar or more for ten consecutive business days. As of February 15, 2023, the stock was at $0.76. In March 2023, it was reported that the company received a notice of delisting, which gave them 180 days to raise the stock price above one dollar. Trink, the CEO, had expressed concerns and had stated that the company is working towards a solution to their problem. As of September 2022, it was reported that the organization had enough money to last them until November 2023.\nIn February 2023, FaZe Clan laid off 20% of its staff. Trink attributed it to uncertainty in the economy stated that the company would focus on financial discipline. He reported that the revenue growth for 2022 was a 25% increase from 2021. However, FaZe Clan reported losses of approximately $14 million in the first two quarters of 2023, with slightly decreased revenues. In April 2023, Snoop Dogg departed from FaZe Clan's board, and on September 11, 2023, FaZe Clan announced the immediate termination of Trink from his position as CEO. The company appointed Christoph Pachler, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of FaZe Clan, as the interim CEO.\nIn October 2023, it was announced that FaZe Clan had been acquired by GameSquare Holdings Inc., and subsequently added to the GameSquare esports portfolio. With this acquisition, Bengtson, Oliveira, and Yousef Abdelfattah (FaZe Apex) were appointed as CEO, president, and COO respectively.\nOn April 27, 2024, Bengtson kicked out members of FaZe Clan, reducing the content creator roster to fourteen members in an effort to \"reboot\" the organization.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Esports World Cup Foundation, funded by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and organizers of the Esports World Cup tournament series, announced the 30 organizations (known in the ESWC as Clubs) who would make up the Club Support Program, with FaZe Clan being one of them. This program gives teams a one-time six-figure stipend if an organization is willing to enter new esports as well as additional funding each year if they drive viewership and fan engagement to the Esports World Cup.\nOn May 14, 2024, GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna announced the formation of FaZe Media, led by Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson as CEO. This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an esports company, and an internet media company. FaZe Media received $11 million in investment from Matt Kalish, the president and co-founder of DraftKings, resulting in Kalish owning 49% of FaZe Media during its foundation.  FaZe Media will focus on developing a creator-led internet media company with GameSquare continuing to own 100% of the esports competition assets under FaZe Esports. On June 19, 2024, Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson acquired 25.5% in FaZe Media from GameSquare.\nIn December 2024, FaZe won Best Content Organization at The Streamer Awards, where it was also nominated for Best Marathon Stream. At the time, its new streamer roster included JasonTheWeen, Adapt, PlaqueBoyMax, Banks, Silky, Lacy, and StableRonaldo.\n\nCurrent divisions\nCall of Duty\nFaZe France\nOn September 19, 2013, FaZe eSniping, their competitive Call of Duty sniping division, was announced with the joining of Raphael \"Zydar\" Zydar, Elliot \"Hyspe\" and Kevin \"RanbOw\", led by Anil \"WaRTeK\" Brancaleoni. On April 3, 2014, FaZe Clan announced the rebranding of FaZe eSniping to FaZe France. RanbOw left the team after one and a half years, with Anthony \"Toto\" replacing him. On May 26, 2015, the players and staff of FaZe France stated they weren't satisfied with FaZe's plans and left to create their own organization.\n\nAtlanta FaZe\nOn May 2, 2019, Activision Blizzard announced that Atlanta Esports Ventures had purchased one of the first five franchise slots for the Call of Duty League. According to ESPN, the publisher was looking to sell slots for approximately $25 million per team. \"We have the opportunity to—once again—play a pivotal role in Atlanta's diverse esports community by bringing the future of Call of Duty esports to the city,\" said Hamilton in a release at the time.

The letter sent had several signatures including Vision Esports head Stratton Sclavos, investor Daniel Deshe, Raizada Group manager Ravi Srivastava and Khalid Jones, who was Fox's partner in the general partnership.\n[\n5\n]\nFox filed a lawsuit against his business partners Amit Raizada and Stratton Sclavos alleging the two partners committed fraud, conspiracy and breach of contract against him.\n[\n6\n]\nIn November 2019, with numerous rumors spreading about Echo Fox splitting apart over the lawsuits,\n[\nwhich?\n]\nan Echo Fox investor officially confirmed the organization was disbanded.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nLeague of Legends\n[\nedit\n]\nOn January 23, 2016, due to some concerns over player work-eligibility, Echo Fox was unable to submit a roster and was required to forfeit their match against\nNRG Esports\n.\n[\n9\n]\nEcho Fox finished last in the\n2016 Summer NA LCS\n, forcing a relegation match. They defeated\nNRG Esports\n3–0 in relegations and qualified for the 2017 NA LCS Spring Split.\nIn 2018, the North American\nLeague of Legends Championship Series\nmoved to a franchised league and Echo Fox invested in a spot as a permanent partner. Echo Fox later received an equity investment from the\nNew York Yankees\nand a new roster, which finished 2nd in the 2018 NA LCS Spring Split with 12 wins and 7 losses after losing a tiebreaker to\n100 Thieves\n.\n[\n10\n]\nOn August 16, 2019, the rosters of both Echo Fox and Echo Fox Academy were released, and the organization departed the professional\nLeague of Legends\nscene.\n[\n11\n]\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive\n[\nedit\n]\nWhile no official reason has been given for Echo Fox allowing its players to leave, it is rumored that this was due to poor performances at both\nELEAGUE Season 2\nand IBUYPOWER Masters 2016.\n[\n12\n]\nAt ELEAGUE, Echo Fox lost versus\nVirtus.pro\n(where they won only a single round on Nuke),\n[\n13\n]\nand versus\nG2 Esports\n(where Echo Fox lost 16–3 and 16–2 ",

After retiring from competitive esports, Lazar became a well-known streamer on Twitch by streaming CS:GO and WarZ. He streams a variety of video games, such as Escape from Tarkov, Grand Theft Auto V, Sea of Thieves, Overwatch, DayZ, iRacing, Foxhole,  Hearthstone and Rust.\n\nStreaming on Twitch\nIn 2017, Lazar garnered widespread attention for surpassing Syndicate's number of followers on Twitch. In 2018, Lazar's became the most-followed channel on the platform, surpassing Riot Games.\nIn May 2018, Lazar streamed gameplay with internet personality Jake Paul and received complaints and criticism from fans due to Paul's recent controversial behavior. Lazar told viewers, \"I'm a little disappointed in chat. I had hoped the 1g squad to be a little bit different. I thought some people had a little bit thicker skin.\"\nIn April 2020, Lazar made comments about Valorant, a free-to-play multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Riot Games. He claimed the game's closed beta was poorly managed, and that other streamers had manipulated Twitch's \"Drops\" system to receive game keys, giving them access to the closed beta to increase their viewer counts and the game's total number of viewers. He later apologized on Twitter, then subsequently deleted the apology.\nIn May 2020, Lazar signed a multi-year contract with Twitch to provide content and partnership support. As of September 27, 2023, he has over 6 million Twitch followers, and is ranked its 28th most popular streamer.\nAs of July 2021, Lazar has regularly speedrun Max Payne 3 during his Twitch streams. He achieved a world record in its \"Hardcore\" category while streaming live on July 2, 2021.\nIn 2023, him and EsfandTV were invited by One Championship to stream their very first MMA event held in the USA.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In mathematical analysis, the maximum and minimum of a function are, respectively, the greatest and least value taken by the function. Known generically as extremum, they may be defined either within a given range (the local or relative extrema) or on the entire domain (the global or absolute extrema) of a function. Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions.\nAs defined in set theory, the maximum and minimum of a set are the greatest and least elements in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of real numbers, have no minimum or maximum.\nIn statistics, the corresponding concept is the sample maximum and minimum.\n\nDefinition\nA real-valued function f defined on a domain X has a global (or absolute) maximum point at x∗, if f(x∗) ≥ f(x) for all x in X. Similarly, the function has a global (or absolute) minimum point at x∗, if f(x∗) ≤ f(x) for all x in X. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the maximum value of the function, denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        max\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\max(f(x))}\n  \n, and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the minimum value of the function, (denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        min\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\min(f(x))}\n  \n for clarity).

Similarly, the function has a local minimum point at x∗, if f(x∗) ≤ f(x) for all x in X within distance ε of x∗. A similar definition can be used when X is a topological space, since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows:\n\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        \n          d\n          \n            X\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (X,d_{X})}\n  \n be a metric space and function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        X\n        →\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:X\\to \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n.

For example, x∗ is a strict global maximum point if for all x in X with x ≠ x∗, we have f(x∗) > f(x), and x∗ is a strict local maximum point if there exists some ε > 0 such that, for all x in X within distance ε of x∗ with x ≠ x∗, we have f(x∗) > f(x). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.\nA continuous real-valued function with a compact domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed and bounded interval of real numbers (see the graph above).\n\nSearch\nFinding global maxima and minima is the goal of mathematical optimization. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the extreme value theorem, global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the greatest (or least) one.Minima\nFor differentiable functions, Fermat's theorem states that local extrema in the interior of a domain must occur at critical points (or points where the derivative equals zero). However, not all critical points are extrema. One can often distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither by using the first derivative test, second derivative test, or higher-order derivative test, given sufficient differentiability.\nFor any function that is defined piecewise, one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is greatest (or least).\n\nExamples\nFor a practical example, assume a situation where someone has \n  \n    \n      \n        200\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 200}\n  \n feet of fencing and is trying to maximize the square footage of a rectangular enclosure, where \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is the length, \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n is the width, and \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy}\n  \n is the area:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        x\n        +\n        2\n        y\n        =\n        200\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x+2y=200}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        y\n        =\n        200\n        −\n        2\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2y=200-2x}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              y\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              200\n              −\n              2\n              x\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2y}{2}}={\\frac {200-2x}{2}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        100\n        −\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=100-x}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n        =\n        x\n        (\n        100\n        −\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy=x(100-x)}\n  \n\nThe derivative with respect to \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    d\n                    \n                      d\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n                x\n                y\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    d\n                    \n                      d\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n                x\n                (\n                100\n                −\n                x\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    d\n                    \n                      d\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    100\n                    x\n                    −\n                    \n                      x\n                      \n                        2\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                100\n                −\n                2\n                x\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\frac {d}{dx}}xy&={\\frac {d}{dx}}x(100-x)\\\\&={\\frac {d}{dx}}\\left(100x-x^{2}\\right)\\\\&=100-2x\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nSetting this equal to \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        =\n        100\n        −\n        2\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0=100-2x}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        x\n        =\n        100\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x=100}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        50\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=50}\n  \n\nreveals that \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        50\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=50}\n  \n is our only critical point.\nNow retrieve the endpoints by determining the interval to which \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is restricted.

For example, in the (enlargeable) figure on the right, the necessary conditions for a local maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first partial derivatives as to z (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative. These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum, because of the possibility of a saddle point. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function z must also be differentiable throughout. The second partial derivative test can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.\nIn contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function f defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the intermediate value theorem and Rolle's theorem to prove this by contradiction). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails. This is illustrated by the function\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        1\n        −\n        x\n        \n          )\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}(1-x)^{3},\\qquad x,y\\in \\mathbb {R} ,}\n  \n\nwhose only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with f(0,0) = 0. However, it cannot be a global one, because f(2,3) = −5.\n\nMaxima or minima of a functional\nIf the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions (i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a functional), then the extremum is found using the calculus of variations.\n\nIn relation to sets\nMaxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an ordered set S has a greatest element m, then m is a maximal element of the set, also denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        max\n        (\n        S\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\max(S)}\n  \n. Furthermore, if S is a subset of an ordered set T and m is the greatest element of S with (respect to order induced by T), then m is a least upper bound of S in T. Similar results hold for least element, minimal element and greatest lower bound. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in databases, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self-decomposable aggregation functions.\nIn the case of a general partial order, a least element (i.e., one that is less than all others) should not be confused with the minimal element (nothing is lesser). Likewise, a greatest element of a partially ordered set (poset) is an upper bound of the set which is contained within the set, whereas the maximal element m of a poset A is an element of A such that if m ≤ b (for any b in A), then m = b. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.  If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.\nIn a totally ordered set, or chain, all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element.  Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element, and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set, we can simply use the terms minimum and maximum. \nIf a chain is finite, then it will always have a maximum and a minimum.  If a chain is infinite, then it need not have a maximum or a minimum.  For example, the set of natural numbers has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain S is bounded, then the closure Cl(S) of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in which case they are called the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the set S, respectively.\n\nArgument of the maximum\nSee also\nDerivative test\nInfimum and supremum\nLimit superior and limit inferior\nMaximum-minimums identity\nMechanical equilibrium\nMex (mathematics)\nSaddle point\nSample maximum and minimum\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThomas Simpson's work on Maxima and Minima at Convergence\nApplication of Maxima and Minima with sub pages of solved problems\nJolliffe, Arthur Ernest (1911). \"Maxima and Minima\" .

        "content": "Timothy John Betar (born April 8, 1990), better known as TimTheTatman, is an American live streamer and YouTube personality.\n\nCareer\nBetar started streaming on Twitch in 2012 and has amassed over seven million followers since. Broadcasting games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, Fortnite and World of Warcraft, the variety channel attracts thousands of viewers each day.\nBetar is a Monster Energy esports athlete and is also sponsored by Audio-Technica He was a certified Twitch partner and has been a full-time creator since March 2014. After joining YouTube on January 23, 2011, the channel has grown to 3.2 million subscribers with videos viewed over 524 million times.\nWith the release of Epic Games's Fortnite in July 2017, Twitch stream viewership skyrocketed. The game streamed nearly 151 million hours during the first month of release. Streamers such as Betar, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, and Turner \"Tfue\" Tenney, saw a steady increase in followers as the game grew in popularity.\nDuring E3 2018, Epic Games held its first-ever Fortnite Celebrity Pro-Am, which paired up celebrities with professional gamers to raise money for charity. Betar teamed up with Mack Wilds for the event. Betar won the award for Fan Favorite Male Streamer/Gamer of the Year at the 2018 Gamers' Choice Awards. \nIn September 2021, Betar announced an exclusivity contract with YouTube. He signed with Complexity Gaming as a part-owner and content-creator that same month.\nIn May 2023, he made a request for the removal of his skin from the popular video game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. This request was made in support of his friend, Nickmercs, who had his own skin removed by Activision after tweeting \"They should leave little children alone. That's the real issue.\" in response to a brawl in California that stemmed from schools attempting to incorporate lessons on the LGBTQ+ community into the school curriculum.\nOn September 1, 2024, Betar returned to the Twitch live-streaming platform following the expiration of his exclusivity contract with YouTube. He now simulcasts his content across multiple platforms.\n\nAwards and nominations\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2018, Betar teamed up with fellow streamers to raise money for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital under the GuardianCon charity stream marathon. The event raised over $2.7 million for children's medical research. During his time block alone, Betar set the Twitch charitable donation record by raising more than $106,000 in 4 hours.\n\nPersonal life\nBetar was born on April 8, 1990. After meeting in high school, Betar and his wife Alexis were married in August 2016. The couple had a son, Brewer, on April 11, 2019. Betar is a native of Syracuse, New York and is a fan of the Syracuse Orange.\n\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Félix Lengyel (French pronunciation: [feliks lɑ̃ʒɛl]; born November 12, 1995), better known as xQc (formerly xQcOW), is a Canadian online streamer, influencer, and former professional Overwatch player.\nWhile he is best known for his streaming career, Lengyel initially gained recognition as a professional Overwatch player. His esports career began in 2016, during which he also started streaming regularly. He joined the Dallas Fuel, a team competing in the inaugural season of the Overwatch League, in late 2017. However, his time with the Dallas Fuel was marred by controversy, resulting in repeated suspensions and ultimately his release from the team midway through the season. Additionally, Lengyel represented Team Canada in the Overwatch World Cup from 2017 to 2019.\nFollowing his departure from competitive Overwatch, Lengyel shifted his focus to a full-time streaming career on Twitch. During this period, he also signed with several esports organizations, such as Sentinels and Luminosity Gaming, as a content creator. Throughout his streaming career, Lengyel has faced several bans and suspensions on Twitch for violating platform guidelines. These incidents involved showing explicit content, making offensive remarks, and engaging in stream sniping. Despite these controversies, Lengyel maintained a large and dedicated fanbase, consistently attracting high viewership numbers. He was the most-watched streamer on Twitch for three consecutive years, from 2020 to 2022. In June 2023, Lengyel signed a two-year, non-exclusive $100 million deal to stream on Kick.\n\nCareer\nEarly streaming\nAfter finishing high school, Lengyel enrolled in a CEGEP, studying business administration until dropping out in second year after feeling \"directionless\". At the age of 19, Lengyel subsequently began streaming on the platform Twitch, where he initially played League of Legends (LoL) under the pseudonym xQcLoL. The name xQc was derived from the last letter of his first name, x, combined with the abbreviation for his home province of Quebec, QC. As his streaming career progressed, Lengyel gained recognition and prominence primarily through his involvement with Overwatch, a video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. Consequently, he adjusted his alias to xQcOW to reflect his association with Overwatch (OW).\n\nEsports\nLengyel embarked on his professional esports career in Overwatch by initially competing in smaller online tournaments as a tank player for teams such as DatZit Gaming. In October 2016, he was recruited by Denial Esports, a prominent multi-game esports organization. However, after a brief period, Denial disbanded, leading Lengyel and his former teammates to form an independent roster called Yikes, which later underwent a name change to Arc 6. During their tenure, the team participated in Season Zero of Overwatch Contenders, where Lengyel's competitive drive appeared to reach unhealthy levels. He acknowledged prioritizing gaming over fundamental aspects of life, such as sleep, nutrition, and personal relationships, and he would dedicate all of his time to playing ranked matches to regain confidence following subpar performances. Lengyel also had the opportunity to represent Team Canada in the 2017 Overwatch World Cup. The team reached the tournament finals before ultimately being defeated by the reigning champions, South Korea. Despite the loss, Lengyel was named the event's most valuable player.\n\nIn October 2017, Lengyel joined the Dallas Fuel, one of the teams competing in the inaugural season of the Overwatch League (OWL). However, before the start of the season, he faced two suspensions on his personal Overwatch account from Blizzard. The first suspension was a 72-hour penalty in November for misusing the game's reporting system. The second suspension, a seven-day penalty in December, was a result of him throwing games on stream. Lengyel's debut in the Overwatch League occurred during the Fuel's first match of the season on January 10, 2018. The team suffered a 1–2 loss to the Seoul Dynasty. Following the Fuel's third match, a 0–4 defeat against the Houston Outlaws on January 18, Lengyel made homophobic remarks directed at Austin \"Muma\" Wilmot, a player from the Outlaws who is openly gay, during his personal Twitch stream. Lengyel later issued an apology to Muma on Twitter, expressing that his comments were not intended to be malicious and that he had spoken hastily. In response to the incident, the Fuel decided to bench Lengyel for the subsequent match on January 19. Additionally, the Overwatch League fined him $2,000 and suspended him for four matches. The Fuel then extended the suspension through February 10.\nLengyel made his return to the Overwatch League on February 23 in a 3–1 victory over the Los Angeles Gladiators. However, his comeback was short-lived. On March 10, he received a fine of $4,000 and another four-match suspension from the league. The disciplinary action was taken due to his usage of an emote in a \"racially disparaging manner\" during an Overwatch League stream and on his personal social media accounts. Additionally, Lengyel had used \"disparaging language\" against Overwatch League broadcasters and players on his social media and personal stream. The following day, Lengyel was released from the Dallas Fuel team. In an interview with The Washington Post, he expressed that there were no racial undertones intended with his use of the emote. While Lengyel did not feel that he had made a mistake, he expressed regret for how his actions were misconstrued. He also admitted uncertainty about whether pursuing a professional career in Overwatch was the right path for him.\nLengyel's involvement in the Overwatch scene continued as he joined various teams over the years. He became a part of the Overwatch Contenders teams GOATS and Gladiators Legion. Additionally, he represented Team Canada in the 2018 and 2019 Overwatch World Cups.\n\nReturn to full-time streaming\nAfter his departure from Dallas Fuel in 2018, Lengyel shifted his focus primarily towards his streaming career. In February 2019, he joined esports organization Sentinels as a content creator. By May 2019, Lengyel had gained significant success as one of the most prominent variety streamers on Twitch. However, Lengyel also faced some controversies during his streaming career. In July 2019, he received a three-day ban from Twitch for streaming a video that contained brief explicit content, specifically showing a penis. Although a Twitch employee had reportedly permitted the video, the ban was enforced. However, Lengyel's ban was lifted after just one day. Despite these incidents, Lengyel achieved notable milestones on Twitch. In December 2019, he emerged as Twitch's most watched streamer, accumulating nearly eight million hours of watch time, surpassing other popular channels by a significant margin. Overall, he ranked as the sixth-most watched streamer of the year, accumulating nearly 54 million hours of watch time, with over 14% coming from December alone.\nIn 2020, Lengyel faced a series of bans and controversies during his streaming career. On February 29, he received a three-day ban from Twitch for streaming explicit content in the game Strip 4: Classmate Study. Lengyel entered a code that uncensored nudity in the game, leading to a brief exposure of the female character's breasts. Twitch upheld the ban even after his appeal, and the game gained attention, reaching the top of Steam's \"new and trending\" list. In March 2020, Lengyel started playing chess on his stream, and in April, he received mentoring from chess grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura. Twitch and Chess.com collaborated to organize the inaugural PogChamps, a chess tournament that took place from June 5 to 19. Lengyel participated in the tournament, and in a match against Charlie \"MoistCr1TiKaL\" White, he was defeated in just six moves. The match became the most-watched video on Chess.com's YouTube channel, garnering over ten million views by May 2021. In the PogChamps tournament, Lengyel reached the consolation bracket semifinals but ultimately lost to Ludwig Ahgren. During PogChamps, on June 12, 2020, Lengyel received a 24-hour Twitch ban after accidentally opening a video of gorillas engaging in sexual activity, which was submitted by one of his viewers. Sentinels decided to part ways with him on August 27, 2020, after his request for release. He then joined Luminosity Gaming on October 1, 2020. Lengyel faced another suspension from Twitch on November 18, 2020, when he and his team stream sniped an opposing team during a Twitch Rivals event for Fall Guys. This marked his fourth suspension from Twitch, resulting in a seven-day ban. He was also banned from Twitch Rivals for six months and had to forfeit his prize winnings from the event. Despite the bans and controversies, Lengyel achieved remarkable Twitch viewership in 2020. He accumulated the highest watch hours at over 174 million, surpassing all other channels by nearly 50 million watch hours.\n\nBy mid-2021, Lengyel continued to dominate Twitch viewership, with 163 million hours watched that year, nearly double that of the second-largest channel. In June 2021, Lengyel made the decision to move back to Canada after experiencing multiple instances of swatting, a dangerous prank targeting streamers. He expressed genuine fear for his safety and cited concerns about his well-being. In October 2021, a leak exposed the earnings of top Twitch streamers, including Lengyel. The leak revealed that he was the highest-paid individual streamer, earning over $8 million since 2019. While the accuracy of the leak was questioned, Lengyel confirmed that his reported earnings were correct. Lengyel maintained his position as the most-watched streamer on Twitch in 2021, accumulating 274 million hours watched. His peak viewership reached 173,000 viewers, although it fell short compared to the channel with the highest peak, which garnered 2.5 million viewers.\nIn April 2022, Lengyel participated in the r/place social experiment on Reddit, an online canvas in which registered users could edit by changing the colour of a single pixel. During the event, he targeted a My Little Pony art piece, which resulted in an influx of death threats. Lengyel said that he received more death threats in just one hour during that month than he had throughout his previous six years of streaming combined. Despite the negativity, he broke his Twitch viewership record, peaking at over 293,000 viewers during the event. Later that month, he surpassed that record while streaming a beta build of Overwatch 2, reaching a peak of over 312,000 viewers. He continued to lead all Twitch streamers in terms of hours watched for the year 2022.\nIn January 2023, Lengyel announced his departure from Luminosity Gaming. In June 2023, Lengyel signed a deal with the streaming platform Kick. The deal was valued at $70 million over two years, established a non-exclusive partnership between Lengyel and Kick. Additionally, the agreement included the potential for performance-based bonuses, totaling approximately $30 million. The deal was noted as potentially one of the largest in entertainment history. Lengyel finished 2023 as Twitch's fourth-most watched streamer with a total of 89 million hours watched on the platform.\nIn October 2024, Forbes ranked the influencer 28th in their Top Creators 2024 list.\n\nPersonal life\nLengyel was born on November 12, 1995, in Laval, Quebec, Canada. He is of Hungarian descent.\nFrom 2017 to 2022, Lengyel was in a relationship with fellow streamer Samantha Lopez, known by her Twitch username adeptthebest.\nOn August 5, 2024, Lengyel accompanied online streamer Adin Ross during a meeting with president of the United States Donald Trump.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nXQc on Twitch",

        "content": "Tariq (Arabic: طارق) is an Arabic word and given name.\n\nEtymology\nThe word is derived from the Arabic verb طرق‎, (ṭaraqa), meaning \"to strike\", and into the agentive conjugated doer form طارق‎, (ṭāriq), meaning \"striker\". It became popular as a name after Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Muslim military leader who conquered Iberia in the Battle of Guadalete in 711 AD. It is also the name of a Quranic chapter.\n\nIn literature and placenames\nṬariq is used in classical Arabic to refer to a visitor at night (a visitor \"strikes\" the house door). Due to the heat of travel in the Arabian Peninsula, visitors would generally arrive at night.\nThe use of the word appears in several places including the Quran, where ṭāriq is used to refer to the brilliant star at night, because it comes out visiting at night, and this is the common understanding of the word nowadays due to the Qur'an.\nIt can also be found in many poems. For example, from the famous poets Imru' al-Qais and Jarir ibn Atiyah.\nGibraltar is the Spanish derivation of the Arabic name Jabal Aṭtāriq (جبل طارق), meaning \"Mountain of Tariq\".\n\nUsage\nIn the Balkans, Tarik is popular among Bosniaks in the former Yugoslav nations. This is one of the most popular names in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nGiven name\nTarek\nTarek El Ali (born 1986), Lebanese footballer\nTarek Al Eryan (born 1963), Palestinian-American film

The American YouTuber, social media influencer, and Twitch streamer has gained popularity through his reaction videos, pranks, gameplay content, and insightful commentary on games such as Fortnite, Among Us, and Grand Theft Auto V.\nAd\nYourRAGE's entertaining persona has helped him earn an impressive count of 1.48 million subscribers on YouTube and over 1.4 million followers on Twitch, which continues to grow steadily daily. This growth can be attributed to his engaging and unique content and his entertaining collaborations with fellow content creators like Duke Dennis and Kai Cenat.\nAd\nTrending\nJosh's ability to connect with his viewers through his content and collaborations has undoubtedly contributed to his success. However, being his outspoken and straight talker, Josh has often made\nheadlines for all the wrong reasons\n, some of which we will explore in this article.\nLooking for Crossword hints & solutions? Check out latest\nNYT Mini Crossword Answers\n,\nLA Times Crossword Answers\n, and\nAtlantic Crossword Answers\nFeuding with xQc and four other controversies which helped YourRAGE make headlines\n1) BruceDropEmOff's ban sparks debate\nAd\nAd\nEarlier this year, on March 3,\nthe self-described 'Broward'\naddressed a statement made by Twitch A-lister Felix \"xQc\" after the French-Canadian streamer stated fellow streamer BruceDropEmOff's suspension was not caused by \"spam reporting\" as claimed by Bruce on Twitter.\nThe 25-year-old was quick to call out xQc, calling him a liar while acknowledging the latter's statement on his live stream. Josh was clipped, saying,\n\"Yo, I'm not even going to get on it, because I'm going to repeat myself. xQc wants to get on to a call, so I can tell him how f**king wrong he is. Let's get in a call right now! He doesn't know what the f**k he's talking about, my n****. He does not know what he's talking about!\"\nAd\nBefore addressing xQc's comments once again,\n\"\nBut then I heard him say something. xQc says, 'Spam reports aren't real. Nobody can get banned from spam reporting and nobody has, a Twitch representative told me. It doesn't exist, it's impossible. It can't happen. No, he showed me, he told me.'\"\nYourRAGE did not hold back on his sentiments and hit back at xQc by saying he had\nno idea what he was talking about\nand that being Twitch's \"Golden Boy\" has blurred his views from reality.\nAd\n2) Playing off s*xual assault\nAd\nOn January 17, budding streaming sensation Kai Cenat and YourRAGE were hit with waves of criticism following an on-stream phone call where they were accused of making\ninappropriate jokes about an alleged r*pe incident\nat a party hosted by Kai Cenat.\nOn January 6, Jovi Pena came forward with allegations of being s*xually assaulted at a New Year's party she was invited to by Kai, claiming that the perpetrator was a friend of Cenat's. Accusations were made against Cenat for not taking action or acknowledging his acquaintance with the accused, Djigui Seck.\nAd\nWhile the incident occurred on Kai's stream and did not explicitly feature YourRAGE, there is no denying that joking about s*xual assault while the ongoing case was definitely in poor taste.\n3) xQc-Adept break up drama\nAd\nArguably one of the biggest controversies that arose during the 2022 TwitchCon San Diego featured\nYourRAGE butting heads with Felix \"xQc\"\nafter YRG spotted xQc and his ex-girlfriend Sam \"Adept\" making out following their extremely public breakup just months before.\nAfter YourRAGE spotted xQc and Adept together, he decided to share the news with his viewers. However, the way Josh portrayed their current relationship, depicting Adept as a jealous woman, received criticism from Felix, who addressed the issue during his stream.\nAd\nThe beef quickly escalated and divided fanbases until both xQc and YRG decided to hop onto a discord call to discuss things.\n4) Talking s*it about Hasan\nAd\nThe next entry on the list does not precisely feature YourRAGE making any of these statements targeting the type of content political commentators ",

        "content": "Team Liquid is a multi-regional professional esports organization based in the Netherlands that was founded in 2000. They signed their first professional players with the release of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.\nIn 2012, Team Liquid acquired a North American Dota 2 team, marking their first venture into multi-genre management. In January 2015, Team Liquid officially merged with Team Curse under the Liquid banner, bringing on Steve Arhancet, his supporting staff, and former Curse League of Legends, Street Fighter, and Super Smash Bros. teams. Their European Dota 2 squad won The International 2017, which had one of the largest prize pools for any esports tournament in history. Team Liquid's League of Legends team has won five LCS titles, and their Counter-Strike Global Offensive team was awarded the Intel Grand Slam prize in 2019 after winning four tournaments in just 63 days. Team Liquid also has Rainbow Six Siege, Free Fire and female Valorant teams in Brazil, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang rosters in Indonesia and the Philippines and chess grandmasters Fabiano Caruana and Magnus Carlsen representing the organization.\n\nHistory\nThe website was released on May 1, 2001, by Victor \"Nazgul\" Goossens and Joy \"Meat\" Hoogeveen under the domain teamliquid.cjb.net. On September 22, 2002, the website was moved to the address of teamliquid.net. A day later the very first poll was posted as a vote for the website's name with the teamliquid.net name winning over other suggestions such as likwit.com. On April 5, 2019, it was announced that the website would be moving to the domain tl.net, with teamliquid.net becoming an alias for teamliquid.com in the future.\nAlthough Team Liquid was primarily known as a StarCraft news site, there are many sub sections on the forums dedicated to other games as well. It was announced on August 30, 2012, that Team Liquid would be expanding to covering Dota 2 news. On December 8, 2012, Liquid expanded their esports franchise into multiple games for the first time, with the recruitment of a North American Dota 2 team.\nOn January 6, 2015, Steven \"LiQuiD112\" Arhancet joined Victor Goossens as co-owner of Team Liquid, officially commencing the merge between former Team Curse Gaming under the Team Liquid banner.\nOn September 27, 2016, Team Liquid sold its controlling interest to aXiomatic Gaming, an investment group including Golden State Warriors co-owner Peter Guber, entrepreneur Ted Leonsis, motivational speaker Tony Robbins, basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, and AOL co-founder Steve Case.\nOn December 16, 2017, Team Liquid disbanded their Halo roster.\nIn 2020, the organization introduced Blue, an anthropomorphic horse, as its mascot. Blue has been featured in the organization's merchandising campaigns and collaborations.\n\nOwnership\naXiomatic is an entertainment and sports management company. Investors for the group include Peter Guber, Tony Robbins, Magic Johnson, Ted Leonsis, Steve Case, and Eric Lefkofsky.

With the launch of StarCraft II, TLnet has grown into the largest StarCraft community on the internet, with over 220,000 active members and over twenty four million total posts. The website employs four person full-time staff at their New York City office to work on the site.\nTeam Liquid – Website focusing on Team Liquid esports team coverage.\nLiquipedia – Is a volunteer-run wiki covering various esports, beginning with Starcraft: Brood War and currently covering more than 57 esports titles. In 2023 Liquipedia started to branch into covering traditional sports with their Formula 1 wiki. In 2024, Liquipedia would host the game-focused Dota 2 Wiki, which previously was hosted on Fandom, with an intent to merge both the esports wiki and the game wiki into a single, comprehensive Dota 2 wiki.\n\nRosters\nTournaments and events\nIn addition to running a community site and team, Team Liquid also hosts a variety of tournaments and events.\n\nTeam Liquid Starleague\nThe two iterations of the TeamLiquid Starleague (or TSL for short) have been the largest StarCraft: Brood War tournaments outside of South Korea. The first TSL sponsored by Razer in 2008 was highly anticipated at the time, sporting all of the world's top Brood War players. It was topped one year later with 2009's TSL 2, which featured a total prize pool of over $20,000 and remains the largest non-Korean Brood War tournament to date.\nWith the release of Starcraft II, Team Liquid announced a third installment, sponsored again by PokerStrategy.com with a prize pool of $34,700.  The tournament took place between March and May 2011. On April 25, 2012, a fourth installment was announced (TSL 4).\n\nTeam Liquid StarCraft II Open\nThe TL Opens are one-day open single-elimination tournaments alternating between the NA and EU battle.net servers.

With each win he gains, another handicap is added that limits his game play options, until he loses or he has defeated a certain number of opponents.\n\nEsports history\nStarCraft and StarCraft II\nThe gaming clan \"Liquid\" was founded by Victor \"Nazgul\" Goossens near the end of 2000, after he decided to leave his previous clan. Liquid started with four members for the first months and grew to eight players over the following year. The members of the Liquid clan were handpicked by Goossens.\nWith the arrival of StarCraft II, Team Liquid announced plans to become an active professional esports team. Shortly after, sponsorship by The Little App Factory was announced, which qualified them as a sponsored professional team. This allowed Team Liquid to pay their players a salary and send the team to events around the world. The team created a dedicated news site separate from the more community oriented site, announced and released on May 10, 2011.\nOn August 13, 2012, three players traveled to Korea in order to live in the OGS training house and compete in GOMTV's Global StarCraft II League (GSL).\nOf the three players entering the preliminaries, only one, Dario \"TLO\" Wünsch qualified for the first two GSL events. He was eliminated out in the Second and First rounds respectively.\nThe third GSL was the strongest showing of Team Liquid thus far. Three players, Hayder \"Haypro\" Hussein, Jos \"Ret\" de Kroon and Jonathan \"Jinro\" Walsh qualified for the main tournament. While Hussein lost first round and de Kroon in 2nd, Walsh made to the semi-finals, losing 0–4 to the eventual winner Jang \"MC\" Min-Chul.\nIn 2012, during GSL Season 2, members Song \"HerO\" Hyeon Deok and Yun \"TaeJa\" Young Seo made it to the Round of 8 of the Code S tournament, with TaeJa being eliminated while HerO advanced to the semi-finals of the tournament.\nAt the end of 2023, Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook and Clément \"Clem\" Desplanches reached the semifinals of ESL SC2 Masters: Winter 2023 Finals, at Dreamhack Atlanta. Cure lost to Dark 3-1 while Clem defeated Serral 3-1 and reached the finals. In the grand final, Clem competed against Dark and beat him 4-1.\nAt the start of 2024, Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook was eliminated in the Round of 8 of Master's Coliseum 7, losing 3-4 against Solar.  \nIn February 2024, Clément \"Clem\" Desplanches reached the Quarterfinals in IEM Katowice 2024 but lost 3-0 against Serral.  \nIn February 2024, Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook reached the Semifinals in IEM Katowice 2024 but lost 3-0 against Maru.  \nClément \"Clem\" Desplanches has assured his direct spot in the Esports World Cup 2024 in Riyadh by winning SC2 Masters Winter 2023.  \nKim \"Cure\" Doh-wook has assured his direct spot in the Esports World Cup 2024 in Riyadh by reaching top 4 at IEM Katowice 2024.  \nBoth Clément \"Clem\" Desplanches and Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook stopped in the Knockout Round 3 of ESL SC2 Masters: Spring 2024. Clem lost 3-0 to HerO while Cure lost 3-2 to Shin.\n\nSmash Bros.\nIn March 2014, Team Liquid announced that it had picked up two Melee players: Ken, who is known as the \"King of Smash\" and KoreanDJ, who is known for being the first player to defeat Mew2King during his peak, thus starting its Smash team. After acquiring Curse Gaming, it also signed Hungrybox, who is considered to be one of the Five Gods of Melee, and Chillin, who was the first player to defeat Ken during his prime. On August 11, 2015, it picked up top Super Smash Bros. for Wii U player Nairo, who was the only player to knock ZeRo out of a tournament, ending ZeRo's 55 win tournament streak at MLG World Finals. On September 28, 2015, Team Liquid announced that KoreanDJ resigned from the organization and retired from competitive Smash, citing persistent hand and wrist pains.\n\nLeague of Legends\nOn January 6, 2015, Liquid acquired the Team Curse's League of Legends roster, which consisted of Quas, IWillDominate, Voyboy, Cop, and Xpecial. The team finished the LCS Spring regular season in 6th place with a 10–9 record. On Week 5 and 6 of NA LCS Piglet was benched and replaced on the starting roster by KEITHMCBRIEF in an effort to try to improve their standings. In the playoffs they beat Counter Logic Gaming 3–0, before losing to Cloud9 3–2 and finishing in 3rd.\nTeam Liquid was very successful in 2018 and 2019, winning four LCS splits in a row.  In the 2018 NA LCS season, Liquid had a roster of Impact, Xmithie, Pobelter, Doublelift, and Olleh.  At the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, Liquid went 3–3 in groups and failed to advance.  In the 2019 LCS season, Liquid replaced Pobelter with Jensen and Olleh with CoreJJ.  Liquid failed to make it out of groups at the 2019 League of Legends World Championship, however, as their 3–3 record was insufficient to advance.  In 2020, Broxah joined the team as jungler, replacing Xmithie.  The 2020 Spring Split went very poorly for Liquid; they finished ninth place out of ten.  Doublelift was benched due to motivation issues and replaced by Academy ADC Tactical, and Doublelift was eventually traded to Team SoloMid for the summer split, with Tactical promoted to starter.  Liquid finished third that summer split and made it to 2020 League of Legends World Championship, but again their 3–3 record was insufficient to advance to the quarterfinals.  In 2021, Santorin replaced Broxah as jungler, and LEC import Alphari replaced Impact as top laner.  The team once again got a 3–3 record in groups at the 2021 League of Legends World Championship; this qualified them for a tiebreaker match with Gen.G, but Liquid lost and failed to advance.\nThe 2022 season saw a major shake-up of the roster, as the Honda sponsorship allowed the creation of a \"super team\" of Bwipo, Santorin, Bjergsen, Hans Sama, and CoreJJ.  Despite high expectations and finishing third place in the regular season of the summer split, Liquid narrowly failed to earn a Worlds slot in the playoffs, a disappointment that caused a major controversy. Hans Sama left the team at the end of the season. On 26 September 2022 they also released Guilhoto from the head coach position.\n\nOther\nOne week after the Curse merger, it was announced that Team Liquid acquired a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team that previously played under the title \"Denial eSports\".\nOn October 9, 2015, it was announced that Liquid would once again be fielding a Dota team, after being absence from the competitive DotA scene for more than a year.\nOn October 21, 2016, it was announced that Liquid would be fielding a professional Civilization VI team, captained by former world champion Civilization player MrGameTheory.\nOn August 7, 2020, Team Liquid announced their entrance to the Valorant esports scene by signing the fish123 roster, soulcas, Kryptix, L1NK, ec1s. Alongside these four players, they also added ScreaM as the fifth player. On February 24, 2021, Team Liquid parted ways with ec1s and added Jamppi into the roster.  On April 23, 2021, Team Liquid announced changes to their Dota 2 roster on Twitter. Samuel \"Boxi\" Swann is taking a break from Dota to spend more time with his family. He will be replaced by Saeed Samail \"SumaiL\" Hassan. On December 25, 2021, analyst and translator Leon \"Arthur\" Lee interviewed Team Liquid coach, William \"Blitz\" Lee, who talked about the formation of the team, MATUMBAMAN and Zai, captain iNSaNiA and opponents at the Dota Pro Circuit. On 22 September 2022, they were announced as one of the 10 partner teams for the Valorant EMEA league.\nOn May 5, 2023, Team Liquid became the first Dota 2 team to score the minimum number of DPC points and qualify for The International 2023.\nOn November 21, 2023, Team Liquid announced its departure from Rocket League.\nIn May 2024, Team Liquid announced it was officially re-entering competitive Apex Legends play after signing the orgless team \"Legacy\" ahead of the 2024 Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) Split 1 Playoffs LAN. It marked Team Liquid's return to the Apex scene, after leaving in December 2022. The roster is made up of Saul \"YanYa\" Ocampo, Luis Enrique \"Neazul\" Ramos Suarez, Alexis \"Jaguares\" Martinez, and Steven \"Pistillo\" Rojas as the coach.\nOn February 13, 2025, Team Liquid entered chess by signing American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana. The next day, on February 14, Liquid signed the Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen. Both players will represent Liquid during the Champions Chess Tour 2025.\n\nSponsors\nOn January 24, 2015, it was announced that HTC had become an official sponsor of Team Liquid.\nIn June 2022, Liquid got Honda as a major sponsor for their League of Legends team.  The League team was renamed \"Team Liquid Honda\" as a result.\n\nManagement\nVictor \"Nazgul\" Goossens is a founding member, and currently co-owner and chief executive officer of Team Liquid.

Since the merge, Steve has taken the role of co-owner and chief executive officer and primarily manages the League of Legends team.\n\nAlienware Training Facility\nIn 2017 Team Liquid finished constructing its Alienware Training Facility in Los Angeles, which is designed to act as the training grounds for Team Liquid's CS:GO and League of Legends teams, as well as their esports headquarters. The facility houses non-players such as owner Steve \"LiQuiD112\" Arhancet and 1UP Studios, Team Liquid's in-house production studio, so that all departments of Team Liquid could work together. Team Liquid's sponsor Alienware supplied all the PC's to the Alienware Training Facility.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Rachell \"Rae\" Marie Hofstetter (born January 8, 1992), better known as Valkyrae, is an American online streamer and YouTuber. She is a co-owner of the gaming organization 100 Thieves and founder and CEO of the media company Hihi Studios. \nHofstetter began streaming on Twitch in 2015. She had her breakthrough by playing the competitive online game Fortnite in 2018 and joined 100 Thieves as their first female content creator. In 2020, she switched streaming platforms by signing an exclusive contract with YouTube. Later that year, she saw significant follower growth and reached her peak viewership when playing the online social deduction game Among Us, which led to her winning the Game Award for \"Content Creator of the Year\" and the Streamy Award for best live streamer. She was also named \"Gaming Creator of the Year\" by Adweek in 2021 and was included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.\n\nEarly life\nRachell Marie Hofstetter was born on January 8, 1992, and grew up in Moses Lake, Washington. She is of Filipino and German descent and has three brothers and one younger sister. She cites her mother as the reason she became interested in video games, who encouraged her to pursue it as a hobby from a young age. She attended community college and worked a job at GameStop to support herself, later graduating with an associate degree in arts and science.\n\nCareer\n2015–2019: Early career, initial popularity, and joining 100 Thieves\nWhile working at GameStop, Hofstetter began sharing her gaming hobby on Instagram, gaining a following. After being encouraged by her followers, she started live streaming on Twitch in 2015. She later began uploading her gaming content to YouTube and had her breakthrough by playing the competitive online game Fortnite in 2018. That October, she became the first female content creator for the gaming organization 100 Thieves.

In her first three months on YouTube, she averaged around 1,500 concurrent viewers. Her stream then experienced significant growth and, in late 2020, regularly peaked at concurrent viewer counts exceeding 100,000. This was driven by her playing the online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us and collaborating with popular streamers like Disguised Toast, Sykkuno, Pokimane, PewDiePie, and Cr1TiKaL, in addition to public figures like politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, musician Lil Nas X, and television personality Jimmy Fallon. Hofstetter became the fastest-growing female streamer of 2020 and surpassed Pokimane as the year's most-viewed female streamer. In December 2020, she won Content Creator of the Year award at the 2020 Game Awards.\nOn April 7, 2021, Hofstetter and CouRageJD joined the ownership group of 100 Thieves, alongside Dan Gilbert, Scooter Braun, Drake, and its founder, Nadeshot. As co-owners, they received equity in the company, which Forbes valued at $190 million at the time. In May 2021, she won Gaming Creator of the Year award at the 2021 Adweek Creator Visionary Awards.

In December 2024, she was nominated for The Sapphire Award at the fourth annual Streamer Awards.\n\n2025–present: Return to Twitch\nBy January 2025, Hofstetter's exclusive streaming contract with YouTube had expired. She returned to Twitch on January 8, while celebrating her 10th streaming anniversary and her 33rd birthday. During her first week, she was the most-watched female streamer on Twitch, based on hours watched. \nOn February 24, 2025, Hofstetter began a week-long IRL streaming marathon in Los Angeles with fellow streamer Brittany \"Cinna\" Watts titled Sis-A-Thon. Hoffstetter and Watts had planned on holding the marathon in January, but it was postponed due to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires. On March 2, the final night of the marathon, Hoffstetter, Watts, and their guest Emily \"Emiru\" Schunk, were targeted by a stalker at Pacific Park on the Santa Monica Pier. A man, who introduced himself as \"Russell\", had approached the live streamers and asked Emiru for her phone number, who declined but offered to take a photo with him. The man would change clothes and reapproach the women again over a half hour later, asking Emiru for her number after they got off the Ferris wheel. The man became aggressive after they told him no again, threatening to kill the streamers and requiring to be held back by Cinna's cameraman Rosii as they called for park security. The streamers ended the marathon early and contacted the police, Hofstetter tweeting the following morning: \"We are all ok and have been with police. We decided we are done with the marathon and need time to process! Thank you for all the love and support this past week, we had so much fun and hope you all enjoyed. That end of marathon brunch stream we had planned tomorrow with friends will be rescheduled for sometime in the far future :’) Please send love to emiru, Cinna, Rosie [sic] and Emily! Everybody is in shock but I’m so glad were [sic] together\". Later that day, Hofstetter and Watts went live to address the incident and officially conclude the marathon.\n\nOther activities\nPhilanthropy\nOn April 6, 2021, Hofstetter participated in an Among Us charity livestream held by The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon with several notable celebrities  such as Gaten Matarazzo and Noah Schnapp of Stranger Things, American hip-hop band The Roots members Questlove, Black Thought, and Captain Kirk Douglas, and fellow streamers and YouTubers Sykkuno and Corpse Husband. The event raised over $25,000 for Feeding America.\nIn June 2022, Hofstetter participated in a Minecraft charity tournament held by the MC Championship with several other creators to raise money for The Trevor Project.

The event raised over $10 million in donations.\nHofstetter donated $10,000 towards the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023.\n\nRFLCT and controversy\nOn October 19, 2021, Hofstetter announced the launch of her skincare brand, RFLCT. The brand, primarily geared towards gamers and those who put in heavy screen time, claimed that users are susceptible to skin damage caused by prolonged exposure to blue light and that their products protect against it.\nRFLCT received backlash due to insufficient evidence supporting the claim; according to Kathleen Suozzi, the director of the aesthetic dermatology program at Yale University, unless someone was already prone to melasma or hyperpigmentation, they were unlikely to suffer any consequence of sitting in front of a screen for long periods of time. Hofstetter responded by stating that \"all of the hate, doubt, concerns, and criticisms are all warranted and valid\" and that she was \"very upset and confused\" with the lack of information on its website, promising additional information supporting the products would be made available. She was later informed that the research conducted by RFLCT supporting the products—which she had been given access to during development—could not be released to the public.\nHofstetter then expressed a desire to part ways with RFLCT but was contractually bound. On October 30, 2021, RFLCT ceased operation of its website and online store. A statement on the website read: \"While we believe in the formulations created, after further reflection, have decided to move forward on new paths, effectively terminating the RFLCT brand.\"\n\nPersonal life\nHofstetter resides in Los Angeles. From 2016 to 2021, she was in a relationship with fellow streamer Michael \"Sonii\" Sherman. From April 2023 to July 2024, she lived with fellow streamers Leslie \"Fuslie\" Fu, Miyoung \"Kkatamina\" Kim, and Christina \"TinaKitten\" Kenyan, collectively known as \"The Roomies\".\nHofstetter endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nMusic videos\nDiscography\nAwards and nominations\nListicles\nSee also\nList of YouTubers\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nValkyrae's channel on YouTube\nValkyrae at IMDb",

The term is most often used in reference to burial sheets, mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the Jewish tachrichim or Muslim kaffan, that the body is wrapped in for burial. A famous example of this is the Shroud of Turin.\nA traditional Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter shin, mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, due to the prohibition of Shaatnez. A pious Jewish man may next be enwrapped in either his kittel or his tallit, one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 mitzvot (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a sovev in Hebrew (a cognate of svivon, the spinning Hanukkah toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, dreidel), before being placed directly in the earth (or in a plain coffin of soft wood where it is required by governing health codes).\nThe Early Christian Church also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. Early Christian shrouds incorporated a cloth, the sudarium, that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or his friend, Lazarus (John 11, q.v.). An account of the opening of the coffin of Edward I says that the \"innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body\". The use of burial shrouds was general until at least the Renaissance – for much of history, a new set of clothing was an expensive purchase, so preparing the deceased in this manner ensured that a good set of clothes could be retained for further use by the family.\nIn Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.\nOrthodox Christians still use a burial shroud, usually decorated with a cross and the Trisagion. The special shroud that is used during the Orthodox Holy Week services is called an Epitaphios. Some Christians also use the burial shroud, particularly the Catholics (Roman/Eastern), among others.\nMuslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen.  The Burying in Woollen Acts 1666–80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.\nShrouds can also be used for cremation ceremonies in either a funeral home or crematorium.\n\nSee also\nBody bag\nCoffin\nSudarium of Oviedo\nIslamic funeral\nUrn\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Shrouds at Wikimedia Commons",

        "streamer": "VALORANT",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant",
        "content": "Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games. A free-to-play game, Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020 for Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.\n\nGameplay\nValorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a \"classic\" pistol and one or more \"signature ability\" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. As of February 2024, the game offers 26 agents to choose from. Five agents are unlocked at account creation, with the rest unlocked using an in-game currency called Kingdom Credits.  Kingdom Credits can be acquired by playing games or completing daily and weekly tasks, and can be spent on unlocking new agents or cosmetic items. However, within the first 28 days of release, new Agents can only be unlocked with Valorant Points (VP), Agent Recruitment Events, or by having a linked and active Xbox Game Pass subscription. VP is an in-game currency that can only obtained by purchasing it with real money, and it can be spent on cosmetic items or new agents.\n\nUnrated\nIn the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point. If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point. If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches. Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote reaches 4 (in contrast to 5 for competitive), the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit. A team gets only three chances to surrender: once in the first half, once in the pistol round of the second half, and once more in the second half.\n\nSpike Rush\nIn the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.\n\nSwiftplay\nSwiftplay matches are simply a shortened version of the Unrated game mode. 10 players are split into 2 teams, attackers and defenders. Attackers must plant the spike while the Defenders must stop them. What differs Swiftplay to Unrated is that it is best to 9 rounds - the first team to win 5 rounds wins the match. On round 4, the team's players switch, as they would do in round 7 in the Unrated game mode. The game's currency system has no changes from Unrated. Swiftplay is meant as a quick game mode, averaging around 15 minutes per game, as opposed to around 40 minutes for Unrated.\n\nCompetitive\nCompetitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level 20 before playing this mode. In July 2020, Riot introduced a \"win by two\" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant. Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers. Radiant is reserved for the top 500 players of a region, and both Immortal and Radiant have a number associated to their rank allowing players to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at their level.\n\nPremier\nPremier is a 5v5 gamemode that allows players a path-to-pro competitive game mode that is aimed towards players that wish to be a professional player. Premier was first introduced in alpha testing in Brazil before being rolled out worldwide by 2024. Players will need to create a team of five to compete against other teams in divisions. Each season will last a few weeks and the top teams will be invited to compete in the Division Championship, with winning teams able to be promoted to their region's Challengers league and therefore be part of the VCT ecosystem. This gamemode includes a pick-and-ban system for maps unlike all the other gamemodes where the players have to play the map selected by the system.\n\nDeathmatch\nThe Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020. 14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. The players will spawn with a random agent, equipped with a max shield and an infinite supply of credits to buy any weapons from the buy menu. All abilities are disabled during the match, which indulges pure gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, which reset the player to maximum health, armor, and replenish the ammunition in each of their guns.\n\nTeam Deathmatch\nThe Team Deathmatch gamemode was announced on June 15, 2023, and went live on June 27 with patch 7.0. This gamemode combines and borrows elements from the standard unrated mode as well as the regular deathmatch mode. It is a free-for-all gamemode where players are split into two teams with five players each. Each match lasts for 9 minutes and 30 seconds, and the first team that reaches 100 kills win. If neither team has reached 100 kills at the end of the 9.5 minutes, then the team with the most kills wins. Each match is split into four stages, with the weapon selection becoming progressively more powerful as players advance through the stages. Players are respawned in a spawn room after being killed. where they will be able to select and adjust their weapons loadout if needed. Unlike the regular deathmatch mode, players need to select their agents before the match begins, as agent abilities are allowed in this gamemode. Players can charge their agents' ultimate abilities either by acquiring Ultimate Orbs spawned randomly throughout the map, or by getting kills. Their ultimate abilities will be available for use after their ult percentages reach 100%. Unlike all other gamemodes, this mode is not played on the standard maps, but rather on its own set of three maps that are specifically designed for team deathmatch: Piazza, District, and Kasbah.\n\nEscalation\nThe Escalation gamemode was introduced on February 17, 2021 and is similar to the \"gungame\" concept found in Counter-Strike and Call of Duty: Black Ops, though it is team-based rather than free-for-all with 5 players on each team. The game will pick a random selection of 12 weapons to move through. As with other gungame versions, a team needs to get a certain number of kills to advance to the next weapon and the weapons get progressively worse as the team moves through them. There are two winning conditions, if one team successfully goes through all 12 levels, or if one team is on a higher level than the opposing team within 10 minutes. Just like Deathmatch, players spawn in as a random agent, unable to use abilities, as the gamemode is set for pure gun fights. Though, abilities like Sova's shock darts, Raze's boom bot, and rocket launcher, are abilities that everyone gets to use as a weapon. After a kill, green health packs drop, which replenishes the player's health, armor, and ammo to its maximum. The gamemode also has auto respawns on, respawning players in random locations around the map.\n\nReplication\nThe Replication gamemode went live on May 11, 2021. During the agent select, players vote on which agent they would want to play as. At the end of the time, or after everyone has voted, the game randomly selects one of the player's votes. The entire team will then play as that agent, even if one of the players has not unlocked that agent. It is a best of nine, with the players switching sides after the fourth round. Players can buy guns and shields with a pre-set number of credits. Abilities are pre-bought. Weapons and shields are reset every round. This gamemode was removed in patch 7.0.\n\nSnowball Fight\nSnowball Fight was a limited-time gamemode that was released on December 15, 2020, and is only available during Christmas season. It is a Team Deathmatch game mode, with 50 kills to win. Abilities are not allowed to be used, and players spawn in as a random agent. The only weapon available is the snowball launcher, which is an instant kill, but slow, and uses a projectile-based arc. There is infinite ammo. Throughout the game a \"portal\" will spawn, delivering gifts, which each contain a random power up.\n\nAgents\nThere are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played.\nDuelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition for duelists is \"self-sufficient fraggers.\" Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags. On attack, duelists are most often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in front of everyone to get opening picks on enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage when gunfighting an enemy. On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the mobility in their kits, they are able to get a pick and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage.\nSentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage. On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed. On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering a site. This provides valuable time for the sentinels' team members to come and provide defensive support.\nInitiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators' abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This information allows for attackers to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier. On defense, initiators can use their abilities to provide information on where the attackers are going, as well as helping their teammates retake a lost site.\nControllers specialize in \"slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success.\" They use their abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control. To help their team enter into enemy territory, their abilities consist of some kind of smoke, as well as molotovs, stuns, or flashes. With their smokes, controllers can control sightlines on the map, making it safer to move through the map without getting seen. On offense, controllers can smoke off certain sightlines and use their crowd control on common defensive spots to force enemies into the open. On defense, controllers can smoke and/or use crowd control on entryways to delay or discourage the enemy team from moving forward.\n\nDevelopment\nValorant was developed and published by Riot Games, the studio behind League of Legends. Development started in 2014, within their research and development division. Game director Joe Ziegler is credited with the initial idea of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers. David Nottingham is the creative director for Valorant. Trevor Romleski, former League of Legends's designer and Salvatore Garozzo, former professional player and map designer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are its game designers. Moby Francke, former Valve developer, who has been art and character designer for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2, is the art director.\nValorant was developed with two main focuses: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players, and creating a game that would attract a large competitive scene, while solving many of the points of criticism voiced by professional players from games in the genre. Games aimed at large, active communities and player bases, typically free-to-play games like Fortnite or Riot's own League of Legends, tend to put an emphasis on a wider array of system performance improvements and game stability rather than newer technologies or graphics as a way of making sure they're as accessible as possible. In interviews leading up to the game's launch, game director Joe Ziegler and producer Anna Donlon said that Valorant was made for people playing their first tactical shooter just as much as it was for professional players, and that accessibility of the game was a large priority.\nRiot chose to develop Valorant using Unreal Engine 4, which the development team said would allow it to focus on gameplay and optimizations rather than spending time on core systems. To meet the goal of a lower performance barrier so more people could play Valorant, the team set notably low minimum and recommended hardware requirements for the game. To reach 30 frames per second on these small requirements, the game's engineering team, led by Marcus Reid, who previously worked on Gears of War 4, had to make several modifications to the engine. These modifications included editing the renderer using the engine's mobile rendering path as base, or reworking the game's lighting systems to fit the static lighting that tactical shooters often require, as to not interfere with gameplay. Unreal's modern underpinnings also helped to solve many of the issues that Riot set out to solve from other games in the genre, and additional modifications helped to meet the game's other goal of creating a suitable competitive environment, including optimizing server performance by disabling character animations in non-combat situations and removing unnecessary evaluations in the hit registration process. During development, Riot Games made promises to work towards a ping of less than 35 milliseconds for at least 70% of the game's players. To accomplish this, Riot promised 128-tick servers in or near most major cities in the world, as well as working with internet service providers to set up dedicated connections to those servers. Due to the increase in internet traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic, Riot has had trouble optimizing connections and ping to their promised levels.\n\nMobile spin-off\nOn June 2, 2021, Riot Games announced its plans to develop a mobile version of Valorant, which would reportedly be the first step it intends to take to expand the game's universe.\n\nConsole port\nOn June 7, 2024, during Summer Game Fest, Riot announced that Valorant was to be ported over to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with a limited beta beginning on June 14. The PS5 and Series X/S versions do not have cross-play with the PC version as the gameplay is tailor-made for the consoles, but inventory and progress will be synced with the PC version.\n\nRelease\nValorant was teased under a tentative title Project A in October 2019. It was announced on March 1, 2020, with a gameplay video on YouTube called \"The Round\". The closed beta of the game was launched on April 7, 2020. For a chance to obtain a beta access key, players were required to sign up for accounts with both Riot Games and the streaming platform Twitch and watch related streams. This beta ended on May 28, 2020, with the game being fully released on June 2, 2020.\nThe limited beta for the console port of Valorant opened on June 14, 2024. It will initially be limited to the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan with other regions joining at later dates. Unlike the PC beta, players are only required to sign up for accounts with Riot Games.\nValorant had a full release on consoles on August 2, 2024.\n\nReception\nValorant has been compared to Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, with both games having two teams of five attempting to plant a bomb, and Blizzard Entertainment's class-based shooter Overwatch, as both games have multiple classes and characters catering to various playstyles.\nAusten Goslin of Polygon praised the beta of Valorant describing it as refined and \"one of the most fun tactical shooters I've played\". On the first day of its beta launch, Valorant amassed the second most concurrent viewers for any game ever on Twitch, with 1.73 million viewers tuning in across dozens of streams. Many of these Twitch streams also had drops enabled, with viewers watching during this beta period in hopes of acquiring a beta game key. Only another title from Riot Games, League of Legends, has had more concurrent viewers, when 1.74 million watched the 2019 World Championship final.\nThe official Valorant Discord server has become the second largest gaming and fifth largest community overall on the social platform as of May 2023.\n\nAwards\nPlayer behavior\nValorant has received criticism for its \"toxic\", male-dominated voice communication system. Emily Rand of ESPN talked about her negative experience playing on teams using the voice communication function as a female. Rand \"flat-out [refuses] to use it at all\" when she is not playing with her friends. Jordon Oloman of The Guardian explains how \"the bad apples among Valorant's players expect an absurd level of perfection, and the resultant voice-chat criticism is hardly constructive.\" Furthermore, surveys have shown that 79–80% of players reported to have experienced in-game harassment at some point.\n\nAnti-cheat software\nThe game has been criticized for its anti-cheat software, Riot Vanguard, as it was revealed to run on a kernel driver, which allows access to the computer system. OSNews expressed concern that Riot Games and its owner, Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent, could spy on players and that the kernel driver could be potentially exploited by third parties. However, Riot Games stated that the driver does not send any information back to them, and launched a bug bounty program to offer rewards for reports that demonstrate vulnerabilities with the software. The bounty will reward white hat hackers between $25,000 to $100,000 for reports on its vulnerabilities, with the pay being based on the severity of the exploit. Gameplay bugs do not qualify for this bounty.\nValorant will not run on Windows 11 if the system does not have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessor and UEFI secure boot enabled, as mandated by Microsoft's minimum system requirements for the operating system.\n\nEsports\nValorant has an active esports scene. The highest tier of Valorant Esports is run by Riot Games. \nIn 2020, Riot Games launched \"First Strike\", a tournament designed to establish a foundation for an esports scene to be created with the game.\n\nOpen-qualifiers era (2021–22)\nIn November 2020, Riot Games announced the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT), which is a year-long tournament circuit consisting of three levels:\n\nChampions - the world championship\nMasters - international competitions in mid-season, divided into many stages\nChallengers - regional competitions which are qualifiers for Masters\nTeams will qualify directly for Champions via top places in Circuit Point Standings of their region, based on results of Challengers and Masters. Teams who are at middle places in Circuit Point Standings will have one more chance to qualify for Champions by winning the Last Chance Qualifiers (North America, EMEA, South America, Asia Pacific).\n\nPartnerships era (2023–present)\nIn 2023, Riot Games announced a partner team model for their Valorant Champions Tour. The 30 franchised teams played their first LAN tournament at the VCT LOCK//IN at São Paulo, Brazil, which officially marked as the beginning of the VCT 2023 season. These partnered teams compete in 3 regional leagues to qualify for Masters and Champions.\n\nPartner System\nChampions - the world championship\nMasters - international competitions in mid-season, divided into many stages\nInternational Leagues - three competitions divided by international territory (Americas, EMEA, Pacific) which are qualifiers for Masters and Champions\n\nNon-Partner System\nAscension - three competitions divided by international territory (Americas, EMEA, Pacific) which serve as promotion into the International Leagues\nChallengers - regional competitions which are qualifiers for Ascension\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOfficial website (Esports)",

Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, or taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features offline training modes that can be played solo.\nSiege\nis an entry in the\nRainbow Six\nseries and the successor to\nTom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots\n, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. After\nPatriots\nwas eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, Ubisoft decided to\nreboot\nthe franchise. The team evaluated the core of the\nRainbow Six\nfranchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual\ncounter-terrorism units\nand looked at real-life examples of sieges such as the 1980\nIranian Embassy siege\n. Powered by\nAnvilNext 2.0\n, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments. It was released for\nPlayStation 4\n,\nWindows\n, and\nXbox One\nin December 2015 and for\nPlayStation 5\nand\nXbox Series X/S\nin December 2020.\nThe game received an overall positive reception from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a \"\ngames as a service\n\" model for the game and subsequently released several packages of free\ndownloadable content\n. Several years after the game's release, some critics regarded\nSiege\nas one of the best multiplayer games in the modern market due to the improvements brought by the post-launch updates. The company partnered with\nESL\nto make\nSiege\nan\nesports\ngame. In December 2020, the game surpassed 70 million registered players across all platforms.\nRainbow Six Extraction\n, a\nspin-off\ngame featuring\nSiege\ncharacters, was released in January 2022. In March 2025, it was announced that the game will receive a major upgrade with a transition to a\nfree-to-play\ngame in June of the same year when Season 2 of Year 10 begins, with the game being rebranded as\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege X\n.\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nAn alpha gameplay screenshot of the game, showcasing the Hostage Mode.

        "content": "Manuel Schenkhuizen (Dutch: [ˈmaːnyʋɛl ˈsxɛŋkˌɦœyzə(n)]), better known as Grubby, is a Dutch internet personality and former professional esports player. He competed in the real-time strategy genre, predominantly playing Warcraft III (WC3), Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne and Starcraft II. Grubby is one of the most successful WC3 players of all time, as an Orc player, having won more than 38 LAN tournaments, of which six were World Championships. His command over the Horde placed him early enough among the elite of the WC3 players, while his clash with Jang \"Spirit Moon\" Jae-ho rewarded him with a legendary status among the fans of the game. Grubby is known for being part of some of the most successful WC3 teams in history, namely the British 4Kings. Later teams include the Danish MeetYourMakers and the North American Evil Geniuses. Grubby is widely regarded as one of the greatest Orc players of all time. Grubby is now a popular full-time streamer on Twitch.\n\nEsports career\nGrubby has been on three professional teams throughout his career. His stay in Four-Kings (4K) lasted from October 2003 until January 2008. From January 2008 until January 2009 he featured in MeetYourMakers (MYM). In the past, he has formed strong 2 versus 2 teams with Arvid \"Myth\" Fekken, Yoan \"ToD\" Merlo and Olav \"Creolophus\" Undheim. In 2008, 4K discontinued their Warcraft III team and all the players went their own way. After the disbanding of the team MeetYourMakers in January 2009, Grubby and his then teammate Jang Jae Ho parted ways. He then joined the team Evil Geniuses in April 2009 with his wife Cassandra \"PpG\" Ng. He left the team in April 2011 and continues to compete solo. His major tournament victories include the World Cyber Games in 2004, Electronic Sports World Cup 2005, the World Series of Video Games in 2006, the World Cyber Games 2008, World e-Sports Masters in 2009 and e-Stars 2009 – King of the Game, Seoul – South Korea\nHis accomplishments in the two World Cyber Games victories have led him to be included in the tournament's hall of fame. Schenkhuizen is the only WC3 player to have won both the WCG and the ESWC title. He's also one of the longest playing professional players of Warcraft III. Schenkhuizen is the protagonist in the documentary film Beyond the Game.\nIn 2011, Schenkhuizen moved from Warcraft III to StarCraft II as a Protoss player.\nIn 2015, he began casting esports events for Heroes of the Storm, including casting the world championships at Blizzcon 2015 and 2016.\n\nPersonal life\nSchenkhuizen born in a family of Dutch Indo descent.

        "streamer": "MOONMOON",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsatellite",
        "content": "A subsatellite, also known as a submoon or informally a moonmoon, is a \"moon of a moon\" or a hypothetical natural satellite that orbits the moon of a planet.\nIt is inferred from the empirical study of natural satellites in the Solar System that subsatellites may be rare, albeit possible, elements of planetary systems. In the Solar System, the giant planets have large collections of natural satellites. The majority of detected exoplanets are giant planets; at least one, Kepler-1625b, may have a very large exomoon, named Kepler-1625b I, which could theoretically host a subsatellite. Nonetheless, aside from human-launched satellites in temporary lunar orbit, no subsatellite is known in the Solar System or beyond. In most cases, the tidal effects of the planet would make such a system unstable.\n\nTerminology\nTerms used in scientific literature for subsatellites include \"submoons\" and \"moon-moons\". Colloquial terms that have been suggested include moonitos, moonettes, and moooons.\n\nPossible natural instances\nRhea\nThere is a possible detection of a ring system around Saturn's natural satellite Rhea that led to calculations that indicated that satellites orbiting Rhea would have stable orbits. The rings suspected were thought to be narrow, a phenomenon normally associated with shepherd moons; however, targeted images taken by the Cassini spacecraft failed to detect any subsatellites or rings associated with Rhea, at least no particles larger than a few millimeters, making the chance of a ring system around Rhea slim.\n\nIapetus\nIt has also been proposed that Saturn's satellite Iapetus possessed a subsatellite in the past; this is one of several hypotheses that have been put forward to account for its unusual equatorial ridge. An ancient giant impact on Iapetus could have produced a subsatellite; as Saturn despun Iapetus, the subsatellite's orbit would then decay until it crossed Iapetus' Roche limit, forming a transient ring which then impacted Iapetus to form a ridge. Such a scenario could have happened on the other giant-planet satellites as well, but only for Iapetus and perhaps Oberon would the resulting ridge have formed after the Late Heavy Bombardment and thus survived to the present day.\n\nIrregular moons of Saturn\nLight-curve analysis suggests that Saturn's irregular satellite Kiviuq is extremely prolate, and is likely a contact binary or even a binary moon. Other candidates among the Saturnian irregulars include Bestla, Erriapus, and Bebhionn.\n\nArtificial subsatellites\nHistorical\nMany spacecraft have orbited the Moon since the first one in 1966 (Luna 10).\nAs of 2024, no spacecraft has successfully orbited any natural satellite other than the Moon. In 1988, the Soviet Union unsuccessfully attempted to put two robotic probes on quasi-orbits around the Martian moon Phobos.\n\nCurrent\nLaunched June 18, 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a NASA robotic spacecraft currently orbiting the Moon in an eccentric polar mapping orbit. Data collected by LRO have been described as essential for planning NASA's future human and robotic missions to the Moon. Its detailed mapping program is identifying safe landing sites, locating potential resources on the Moon, characterizing the radiation environment, and demonstrating new technologies.\nCAPSTONE is a project launched in June 2022. Composed of a 12-unit collection of CubeSats which spent a few months in transit to the Moon to arrive in November 2022. It will spend about 9 months in the Moon's near rectilinear halo orbit.  CAPSTONE is intended to test and verify the viability of the planned NRHO of planned future Lunar Gateway and its communication efficiency.\n\nFuture planned artificial moon satellites\nThe interplanetary spacecraft JUICE launched in 2023 will enter an orbit around Ganymede in 2032, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than Earth's.\nAdditionally, the multi-agency supported Lunar Gateway human-rated space station began construction in April 2024 in a near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO), primarily in support of the later stage NASA Artemis program missions to the Moon.  Lunar Gateway will also potentially support future missions to Mars and outlying asteroids.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Extrasolar moons at Wikimedia Commons\nShadow Moons: The Unknown Sub-Worlds that Might Harbor Life\nLikely First Photo of Planet Beyond the Solar System\nWorking Group on Extrasolar Planets – Definition of a \"Planet\" Position statement on the definition of a planet.

        "content": "Tyler Steinkamp (born March 7, 1995), known professionally as Tyler1, is an American online streamer and professional League of Legends player.\nSteinkamp first gained notoriety when he was indefinitely banned from League of Legends in April 2016, due to disruptive conduct towards other players; his behavior earned him the nickname \"The Most Toxic Player in North America.\" He was unbanned in 2018 after an appeal; his first stream after reinstatement peaked at over 382,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch, which broke a non-tournament record on the site. By 2021, Steinkamp was one of the most popular online streamers.\n\nCareer\n2014–2016: Initial popularity and ban\nIn 2014, Steinkamp achieved Challenger (the highest rank in League of Legends) and 13th overall on the North American ladder. He was infamous among other high ranking players for his skill in playing the character Draven, but also for his toxic behavior. He verbally abused teammates and intentionally lost the game after perceived slights from his teammates. This behavior eventually led to permanent bans on 22 unique accounts over several years.\nSteinkamp later increased his toxic behavior in order to draw in more viewers. In April 2016 he produced a video compilation of his toxic behavior with a promise to reform. The video received over 2 million views on YouTube. His Twitch channel increased from around 5,700 followers to over 92,000 followers by the end of the month. His improved behavior quickly lapsed but his following continued to grow, prompting high profile and professional players such as Meteos and Doublelift to publicly condemn his behavior.\nOn April 30, 2016, Riot Games employee \"Riot Socrates\" announced that due to \"a well-documented history\" of verbal abuse and player harassment, Steinkamp would no longer be allowed to own a League of Legends account, adding, \"this dragged on too long, but we want you to know when the rare player comes along who's a genuine jerk, we've still got your back.\" Going forward, Riot would ban any account he played on, even if he had not yet broken any rules.\n\n2016–2018: Variety content\nAfter becoming banned, Steinkamp continued to try to play League of Legends, but as soon as he publicly streamed himself playing, Riot Games would quickly discover it and ban his account. He also tried playing in his free time, repeatedly creating new accounts and climbing the competitive ladder before those too were discovered and banned. Unable to play League of Legends, Steinkamp was forced to branch out to other games to entertain his viewers, such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. He also hosted non-gaming streams such as cosplaying as Bob Ross and teaching his viewers how to cook. Despite the ban, Steinkamp's following continued to grow, and he withdrew from university to focus on online content creation full time.\nIn November 2017, Steinkamp hosted an online League of Legends tournament called the Tyler1 Championship Series (TCS). A parody of the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), Steinkamp streamed in front of a green screen to images of LCS stadiums and a commentators' desk. The tournament peaked at over 200,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch and was viewed by professional players and LCS casters. The winning team was awarded $10,000, funded from Steinkamp directly and without any sponsors.\n\n2018: Unban\nIn August 2017, Riot Games community manager Phreak announced that Steinkamp would not be unbanned as some of his recent accounts had been penalized for verbal abuse. However, in October Riot Games employee Aaron \"Sanjuro\" Rutledge made insulting remarks about Steinkamp in the official r/LeagueOfLegends Subreddit's Discord server, saying Steinkamp looked like a \"homunculus\" and that he would die \"from a coke overdose or testicular cancer from all the steroids.\" The company responded saying \"what was said is NOT okay, and we take it extremely seriously\", apologizing to Steinkamp and to the League of Legends community. Steinkamp responded to the incident saying, \"It really sucks that some people still hold a grudge... and refuse to acknowledge I've changed.\" A few days later, investigative esports journalist Richard Lewis reported that Rutledge no longer worked at Riot Games.\nFans began bringing \"#FreeTyler1\" signs to LCS games, which Riot Games later prohibited in the summer finals. Soon after, Steinkamp announced on stream that he received an email from Riot Games that his ban would be lifted at the end of the year if the accounts he played in the last month were \"clean\" of abusive behavior.\nIn January 2018, Steinkamp was unbanned. Tyler's first stream after he became unbanned in January 2018 peaked at over 382,000 viewers, breaking the record for the most concurrent viewers for an individual streamer on Twitch set by Faker in 2017. This record was broken a month later by Dr Disrespect's first stream after returning from a 2-month hiatus, although due to conflicting media reporting and technical issues with Twitch, sources disagree whether the record was actually broken.\n\n2018–present: Return to League of Legends\nToday, Steinkamp is one of the most popular online streamers. He estimates he earns more than $300,000 each year from merch alone, and estimates he has earned over $5 million in total during his streaming career. He has won the \"Best League of Legends Streamer\" award at The Streamer Awards in 2022 and 2023.\nOn April Fools' Day 2018, Steinkamp produced \"A Day in the Life of Tyler1,\" a parody of his life in front of a green screen.\nIn June 2018, during an angry rant about recent changes to the game, Steinkamp admitted he was addicted to League of Legends, prompting other members of the community to share their addiction stories and share advice from Riot Games employees.\nIn September 2018, Riot Games invited Steinkamp to play in a \"Streamer Showmatch\" at the Oakland Arena with Imaqtpie and other content creators. He was also invited to commentate with Mark \"MarkZ\" Zimmerman on the analyst desk for the 2018 NA LCS Summer Finals.\nThe TCS returned in November 2018 with an increased prize pool of $50,000, funded again by Steinkamp directly. Polygon's Austen Goslin praised particularly its improvement in quality compared to the previous tournament, saying, \"What started out as a meme... has morphed into something resembling a real online third-party tournament.\" In December 2019 the TCS returned for a third time. Former Echo Fox team owner Rick Fox joined Steinkamp to commentate the first match. The tournament peaked at over 90,000 concurrent viewers.\nIn 2020, to prove a point, Steinkamp began a \"Jungle Challenge\" to achieve Challenger (the game's highest competitive rank) in the jungle role. He briefly took a break from streaming to focus on the goal full time. He achieved that goal in May 2020 after 1,800 games played. He accomplished the same goal in the top lane role in June 2021 after 1,741 games played and the mid lane role in September 2021 after 1,800 games played. In February 2022 he reached Challenger on the final role of support after 450 games, an achievement few players have done in all five roles in League of Legends. Riot Games celebrated his accomplishment on Twitter and sent Steinkamp a custom-made gift of five medals, one for each role he reached Challenger in.\nIn October 2020, Steinkamp was signed by South Korean esports team T1 as a content creator. The organization produced a video with Steinkamp and T1 player Faker at the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas. The organization parted ways with Steinkamp in 2022.\nIn 2023, Steinkamp developed an interest for online chess. He played 2,435 games in 76 days, an average of 32 games per day. Later that year he was invited to compete in the amateur chess tournament PogChamps. In February 2024, he won \"Best Chess Streamer\" at The Streamer Awards. In March 2024, Steinkamp reached 1705 Elo on Chess.com, a rating that is in the top 1.5% of all players on the site. He achieved a peak Elo of 1960 two months later, placing him in the top 0.6%.\nSince his unban, Steinkamp remained notorious for verbal toxicity. During an October 2022 stream sponsored by Blizzard Entertainment shortly after its release of Overwatch 2, it was revealed he had already been banned from the game's chat; a roll-over from his 10 year ban in Overwatch 1. In July 2022, after losing a match, he accused one of his teammates of wintrading a player on the opposing team. It was revealed they were players of the amateur team Team Ambition and were removed from the team after an investigation.

        "content": "Necros was an early American hardcore punk band from Maumee, Ohio, although they are usually identified with the Detroit music scene.  They were the first band to record for Touch and Go Records.\n\nHistory\nNecros was formed in mid-1979 by then-teenagers Barry Henssler (vocals), Andy Wendler (guitar), and Todd Swalla (drums). After going through a handful of bassists (including Donny Brook, Jeff Allsop, David Cooke, Brian Hyland, Jeff Lake, and Brian Pollack), Corey Rusk joined the band.  Barry Henssler had struck up a friendship with Tesco Vee and Dave Stimson of Touch and Go magazine after sending them a copy of his own 'zine, Smegma Journal.  Vee and Stimson became fans and put out the band's first record, a self-titled 4-song 7-inch EP (recorded prior to Rusk joining) most commonly known as \"Sex Drive\".  This was Touch and Go Records' (then spelled \"Rekords\") first release and was limited to only 100 copies.\nAndy Wendler left the band in 1981 (although he continued to write for them) and Brian Pollack joined on guitar.  Later that year, the band recorded and released another self-titled 7-inch record known as \"IQ32\", produced by Minor Threat vocalist Ian MacKaye. This nine-song effort was jointly released by Touch and Go (which Rusk now had a hand in running) and MacKaye's own Dischord Records.  Wendler rejoined on guitar in late 1982 and, in 1983, the band recorded and released two more records, a 7-inch and LP both titled Conquest For Death.\nEarly on, Necros played with many prominent punk bands, including Black Flag, Bad Brains, Sonic Youth, Minor Threat, and Tesco Vee's group The Meatmen. Necros also toured as openers for horror punk band the Misfits, including at the Misfits' last show in which Todd Swalla stepped in to play drums when Misfits drummer Brian Damage became too drunk to perform.\nIn 1983, Corey Rusk quit the group to concentrate on Touch and Go, after assuming full control of the label and bassist Ron Sakowski stepped in.  Despite the group's steady output at their onset, the band did not release another record for two years.  In an interview with One Solution zine, vocalist Barry Henssler blamed the delay between releases on Rusk's refusal to give the band a definite answer as to whether or not they were still on Touch and Go.  The label has since deleted their Necros releases from their catalogue.\nThe next Necros release came in 1985 as a split LP with White Flag entitled Jail Jello, on Gasatanka Records.  Now featuring a more distinctly post-hardcore sound, the band followed up the split with 1986's Tangled Up LP on Restless Records, along with a single of the same name on Gasatanka. After spending 1987 touring, first with Megadeth and then later the Circle Jerks, the group called it quits.  A live album, Live or Else, appeared posthumously in 1989.\n\nPost break up\nBarry Henssler went on to form the band Big Chief, who recorded for the Sub Pop label.  Ron Sakowski and Todd Swalla reunited in the mid 1990s as part of the final line up of Touch and Go artists Laughing Hyenas.  Andy Wendler played in a group called Gone In Sixty Seconds (also known as G.I.S.S.).\nIn 2002, a limited (only 450 copies pressed) split 10-inch with Authority Abuse was released by Wise Hoodlum Records featuring live Necros recordings from 1981–1983.  The band's first demo was reissued as the \"Ambionic Sound\" 7-inch in 2012, named for the studio where it was recorded.\nIn 2005 Rykodisc reissued Tangled Up and Live or Else together on one CD, currently the only Necros material available on CD.\n\nFormer members\nBarry Henssler - vocals (1979-1987)\nTodd Swalla - drums (1979-1987)\nAndy Wendler - guitar (1979-1981; 1982-1987)\nDavid Cooke - bass (1979)\nBrian Hyland - bass (1979-1980)\nJeff Lake - bass (1980)\nBrian Pollack - bass (1980-1981); guitar (1981-1982)\nCorey Rusk - bass (1981-1983)\nRon Sakowski - bass (1983-1987)\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nConquest for Death (1983, Touch and Go)\nTangled Up (1987, Restless)\n\nEPs and singles\nSex Drive 7-inch (1981, Touch and Go)\nIQ32 7-inch (1981, Touch and Go)\nConquest for Death 7-inch (1983, Touch and Go)\nJail Jello split 12-inch with White Flag (1985, Gasatanka)\nTangled Up 7-inch (1985, Gasatanka)\nNecros/Authority Abuse split 10-inch (2002, Wise Hoodlum)\nAmbionic Sound 7-inch (2012, Alona' Dream)\nClub House Session 7-inch (2013, Alona' Dream)\n\nCompilation and live albums\nRat Music For Rat People Vol. II compilation album (1984, CD Presents, LTD.)\nLive or Else (1990, Medusa)\nTangled Up/Live or Else compilation album (2005, Rykodisc)\nLive in '85 live album (2014, Jett Plastic Recordings)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNecros at Touch and Go Records\nNecros discography at MusicBrainz",

Image via TG Time\nAussieAntics, one of the most prominent Fortnite casters with over 420 thousand Twitch subscribers, was recently fired. The streamer disclosed details about his meeting with the Fortnite team and why he was dropped from the official broadcast.\nAd\nThis shocked some members of the community, as AussieAntics is one of the most notable Fortnite content creators. From watch parties to streams and event updates, the streamer had everything covered.\nAussieAntics fired from Fortnite\nAussieAntics surprised fans and followers alike with an out-of-the-blue tweet Saturday evening, saying he had been dropped.\nMaster the game with our\nFortnite Interactive Map v33.00\nhere!\nDropped from the official broadcast.Going live in 5 minutes to explain why. I will be doing a viewing party for NAE Solo FNCS Finals as well.\n— AussieAntics (@AussieAntics)\nJune 26, 2021\nExpand Tweet\nAd\nTrending\nHe went into further detail during his livestream. AussieAntics was an official Fortnite caster, meaning he worked with Epic Games to promote content and did live streams, commentary and more. This position holds him to a higher standard than any old streamer is held to.\nIn a stream (on his own channel),  he witnessed a player trying to capitalize on his position to surprise and eliminate the top player. However, the latter happened to be a close friend of AussieAntics and what followed was the crux behind this mess.\nAd\nThat top player, as AussieAntics said, was a close friend of the former Fortnite\ncaster\n.\nThe player who was dropped on has been a long term friend of mine for over 2 years now. Was the first pro I ever met. Hearing him cry over losing made me upset.I will continue to make all the content I already do on Fortnite. I still love this game.\n— AussieAntics (@AussieAntics)\nJune 26, 2021\nExpand Tweet\nAd\nHe called the player a \"f*****g loser\" and said \"Rivreyli (the player in question) is going nowhere in life and no one likes you.” This clearly violated Epic Games' terms and conditions, and he was subsequently dropped from the official broadcast.\nMany in the community voiced their support for AussieAntics, but he insisted there was no rivalry between him and Epic Games.\nReally appreciate all the support today. Really didn't expect thatPlease do not direct hate at Epic of anyone at EpicI truly understand where they were coming from and am not upset. Just a tough situationHating on them doesn't support meI'm fine. I'll keep doing me.\n— AussieAntics (@AussieAntics)\nJune 27, 2021\nExpand Tweet\nAd\nIt should be noted that this is not an official ban. He was removed from the broadcast for the ongoing\nFNCS\ntournament\n, but is freely allowed to continue streaming, playing and creating content.\nFortnite FNCS. Image via Epic Games Store\nSome players have expressed solidarity for Aussie, as NRG Zayt changed his in-game name to \"JUSTICE4AUSSIE\". He proceeded to quit after a single match, claiming he was done with Fortnite over what had happened with Aussie.\nAd\nOthers tried to flood his stream with more views than the official Fortnite one. Despite the community's love for Aussie, there's no denying that the streamer's mistake cost him deary.\nFortnite. Image via Epic Games Store\nAussieAntics is still streaming, playing and creating content. His Twitch, YouTube and other outlets haven't been affected by this debacle.

        "content": "Artour Babaev (born July 1, 1996), better known as Arteezy, is an Uzbek-Canadian professional Dota 2 player for Shopify Rebellion. He is also one of the most popular streamers among the community.\nBorn in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Babaev showed much promise as a child, reaching the highest matchmaking rating on the leaderboards in public matches. In November 2013, he made his professional debut in MLG Columbus as a stand-in for Speed Gaming. In January 2014, Babaev, along with North American Dota players Universe and Fear, as well as former Heroes of Newerth players ppd and zai created \"S A D B O Y S\"  [sic], who were later signed by Evil Geniuses.\nHe has also streamed on Twitch since 2014.\n\nHistory\n2013: Early career\nOn November 22, 2013, Arteezy had the opportunity to stand in for bOne7, who was unable to attend due to visa issues, and play for his previous team Speed Gaming (formerly Kaipi) at MLG Columbus. Arteezy handily defeated several more well-established midlaners, including Mushi and Dendi, en route to an underdog victory for Speed Gaming over the all-star Team DK in the finals.\n\n2014: Birth of Evil Geniuses\nOn January 31, 2014, Arteezy, along with Dota 2 veterans UNiVeRsE and Fear, as well as former Heroes of Newerth players ppd and zai, created S A D B O Y S  [sic], which had immediate success. The team won 16 out of their first 18 matches, including winning the Electronic Sports Prime/Shock Therapy Cup while going undefeated. On February 21, 2014, Arteezy and company were announced to be the new Evil Geniuses Dota 2 squad, which continued to be a top-tier team despite being from the weaker North American scene.\nOn March 7, 2014, the new EG attended their first LAN tournament at the Monster Energy Invitational, where they won 3–2 against Cloud9 in the finals. With this victory, the team firmly established its reputation as one of the best Dota 2 teams in the world, due in no small part to Arteezy's skill.\nOn April 29, 2014, Evil Geniuses were directly invited to compete in The International 2014 Dota 2 Championships. With top 3 finishes at three of the four major LANs before TI4, including a first-place finish at The Summit 1 over Team DK, EG was one of the favorites to win the biggest Dota 2 tournament of the year. EG was not as successful as the Chinese Dota 2 teams in adapting to the more aggressive play-style at TI4 but still ended with a 3rd-place finish, taking home US$1,038,416.\n\n2015: Joined Team Secret\nAfter some internal issues with EG, Arteezy left the team and joined Team Secret in December 2014. With Arteezy transitioning to the carry position, Team Secret stormed through The Summit 3, Mars Dota League 2015 and ESL One Frankfurt 2015 taking 1st place at each, establishing themselves as the favorites for The International 2015. Team Secret ultimately finished 7–8th place at TI5.\nFollowing this result, in August he rejoined Evil Geniuses as the carry, with SumaiL continuing in the mid-lane position. This new Evil Geniuses roster finished in third place in Frankfurt Major 2015 despite a strong showing early in the tournament, losing to the eventual winners of the tournament, OG.\n\n2016: Highest ranked player\nEG again finished third at the Shanghai Major 2016 and second at Dota Pit Season 4. On March 22, 2016, Arteezy and teammate Saahil Arora, better known as Universe, left the team to join Team Secret. Universe later re-joined EG before TI6, while Arteezy remained on Team Secret. In September, Babaev left Secret during the post-TI shuffle, returning to Evil Geniuses once again with former Team OG player Cr1t.\nIn July 2016, Arteezy became the second player in Dota 2 history to reach 9,000 Matchmaking Rating (MMR) in online matchmaking. The first player to reach this rating was Team Liquid player Miracle-.\n\n2017: The Manila Masters champion\nEvil Geniuses managed to get first place in The Manila Masters tournament, winning the first prize of $125,000. Later on The International 2017 tournament, despite being one of the directly invited teams, EG finished 9th-12th in the tournament. This led to the departure of position 4 player Zai, who was replaced by former team coach Fear.\n\n2018: The International 2018\nOn July 27, 2018, Evil Geniuses won North America in-house tournament Summit 9 organized by Beyond The Summit. In August 2018, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses finished third place at The International 2018, marking his second 3rd-place finish at the International, his best overall performance.\n\n2019: The International 2019\nIn August 2019, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses finished 5th-6th at The International 2019. Arteezy made a remarkable performance, getting a solo rampage versus 5 enemies on his game with Evil Geniuses against Vici Gaming.\n\n2020: The International 2020\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, The International was postponed until 2021.\n\n2021: The International 2021\nIn October 2021, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses achieved a 9th-12th place finish at The International 2021, receiving $800,400.\n\n2022: The International 2022\nIn October 2022, Arteezy and Evil Geniuses finished 9th-12th place at The International 2022. On November 15, 2022, it was announced that Evil Geniuses would be dropping their current Dota 2 roster. On December 9, 2022, Arteezy joined Shopify Rebellion.\n\n2023: The International 2023\nArteezy, now a member of Shopify Rebellion, took part in the International hosted in Seattle, Washington in October 2023. The team underperformed, based on expectations on the squad, and finished the tournament in 13th to 16th place. As a result of the poor performance of the squad, Shopify Rebellion splintered, and as of now, only Arteezy and Saberlight remain within Canada's Shopify organization.\n\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Hans Eli Sebastian Fors (born 16 December 1990), known by the pseudonym Forsen, is a Swedish Twitch streamer who initially gained popularity for having competed in StarCraft II, but is best known for competing in Hearthstone and for streaming a variety of popular games. He is also known for his rowdy fanbase, who call themselves \"Forsen Boys\" or \"Forsen Bajs\" and have had a hand in popularizing a number of Internet memes. Since December 2018, Forsen has had over one million followers on Twitch, and as of June 2024, has more than 1.7 million followers.\n\nEsports career\nStarCraft II\nIn 2011, Forsen won first place in the E-Sport SM May Qualifier and was the runner-up in the E-Sport SM October Qualifier, earning a total of 3,500 Swedish krona ($382.50) and qualifying for the Swedish National Championships in StarCraft II. In 2012, Forsen garnered attention by advancing to the final group stage of the 2012 DreamHack Stockholm StarCraft II tournament.\n\nHearthstone\nIn Hearthstone, Forsen won his first tournament in the May 2015 HTC Invitational, and won a Play it Cool streaming marathon in October 2015, achieving the highest rank among the competitors after 24 hours of play. In 2015, Forsen was one of the top four Hearthstone streamers, streaming to up to 45,000 viewers on his live stream on Twitch. He was once known as one of the game's most skilled experts at the Miracle Rogue deck, having piloted it to achieve the highest rank in the game's ladder system on both the North American and European servers in June 2014. In 2017, after spending much of his Hearthstone career as a free agent, Forsen signed with American esports organization Cloud9 as a streamer.\n\nStreaming career\nAs of January 2023, Forsen had been a livestreamer on Twitch for over a decade. His stream has been lauded as \"genuinely... fun and entertaining\" for its tightly knit community and inside jokes, as well as for Forsen's tendency to stream \"Lidl\" games, a term coined by Forsen to describe games of low production value.\nIn February 2018, Forsen captained his four-player team to first place in a $100,000 Twitch Rivals PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) Invitational tournament, winning $13,600. The following month, he also participated in the Darwin Project Invitational tournament, taking first place and winning US$20,000. In December 2018, he achieved a personal all-time high viewer count of 80,860.\nIn late 2020, Forsen began a friendly rivalry with fellow streamer xQc, the pair competing to achieve the fastest time in a speedrun of Minecraft. As of October 2023, Forsen has a personal best of 15:28, 70 seconds faster than xQc's best time.\nOn 26 November 2020, Forsen received an indefinite suspension from Twitch after he accidentally showed a GIF sent to him by a viewer displaying a sexually explicit interaction between a woman and a horse on stream. He was unbanned after a month.\nOn 20 April 2023, Forsen was banned again from Twitch. No immediate reason was apparent, nor was the duration known, however, on 24 April he revealed that it was due to watching a \"dubious ASMR youtube video\" on stream, and that the ban would last for one week.\n\nCommunity\nForsen's stream community, known as the \"Forsen Boys\" or \"Forsen Bajs\", has gained notoriety of its own through its practice of stream sniping, especially in games like PUBG. Stream snipers in Forsen's community are noted for locating Forsen in-game and playing loud music and audio through voice chat, and represent a point of appeal for Forsen's audience. In 2018, the Darwin Project Invitational tournament was disrupted by the infiltration of a match lobby by Samme1g, a stream sniper in Forsen's community.\nThe community is also known for its practice of spamming, and its resulting popularization of internet memes and Twitch emotes. The spread of notable emotes such as \"monkaS\" and \"PepeHands\" (images of Pepe the Frog) have been attributed to Forsen's community on Reddit. Their references to Ugandan action-comedy film Who Killed Captain Alex? have also helped popularise the Ugandan Knuckles meme. In January 2018, a warped image of Fors' face (\"forsenE\") became the most-used emote on Twitch worldwide.\nForsen's moderation of the community has been described as \"permissive\" and \"laissez-faire\", and in 2015, he distanced himself from their actions and the \"Forsen Boys\" label. That year, streamer Katy Coe became the target of sexual harassment from members of Forsen's community, culminating in Forsen banning links to her channel after Coe posted to Reddit denouncing the behavior. In 2017, Forsen received a 24-hour ban from Twitch after members of his community spammed the n-word in the 2017 Awesome Games Done Quick chat room.\n\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\nExternal links\nForsen on Twitch\nForsen on Twitter",

        "streamer": "IRONMOUSE",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironmouse",
        "content": "Ironmouse is a Puerto Rican-American VTuber, singer, and Twitch streamer. Active since 2017, she is a founding member of the VTuber group VShojo launched in 2020. In 2024, she became the most-subscribed Twitch streamer of all time, surpassing Kai Cenat's first record during a September 2024 subathon, before being surpassed herself by Cenat during a November 2024 subathon.\n\nCareer\nIronmouse originally planned to pursue a career as a coloratura soprano opera singer, but was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), an immune disorder that has left her largely bedridden and isolated. It has also led to a lung infection called mycobacterium avium complex as she revealed to Projekt Melody in 2021. This required her to remain isolated from others, a situation which intensified in 2020 amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2017, she began to pursue a career as a streamer instead, as she was \"lonely and wanted something to do\". Hesitant to use her real face online, she was inspired by the Japanese entertainer Kizuna AI, the first YouTuber to refer to themselves as a \"virtual YouTuber\"—to stream with a digital avatar to conceal her identity. Her username comes from the villain Sailor Iron Mouse from the manga series Sailor Moon. \nAfter discovering that there were a growing number of users referring to themselves as VTubers like Kizuna, she began to consider herself one. The Ironmouse persona was expanded into a character, which she referred to as a \"bigger version of me\" and being like a superhero costume; her avatar usually takes the form of a horned demon with pink and purple hair, while its backstory—influenced by her having jokingly referred to herself on-stream as such—suggests that the character is a personification of Satan itself. Ironmouse's distinctive, high-pitched speaking voice is the result of a lung infection due to CVID complications which also resulted in her being on oxygen support 24/7; she has remarked that some people have refused to take her seriously because of her voice, and that some fellow streamers have been shocked to find out that it was her real voice, and not being manipulated with a voice changer.\nAmid a growth trend for streamers in general, and especially VTubers, Ironmouse's audience on Twitch began to see increases over 2020 and 2021. The increasing revenue from her streams also allowed her to afford higher-quality health care. In turn, improvements to her condition enabled her to perform longer streams on a more regular basis. In November 2020, Ironmouse was announced as one of the charter members of VShojo, a new U.S.-based agency of English-language VTubers, joining other streamers and personalities such as Nyanners and Projekt Melody. \n\nIronmouse is known for her frequent collaborations with Welsh YouTuber CDawgVA; he had learned of VTubers via Gigguk—one of his colleagues on the Trash Taste podcast. After watching an Ironmouse stream on Twitch out of curiosity and finding her to be \"really funny\", CDawgVA brought her up during a Trash Taste episode with Hololive English member Mori Calliope as a guest. The acknowledgement led to interest from Ironmouse, who had been also been following CDawgVA's own streams. Her involvement began with a voice cameo in one of his videos, and later collaborative streams; CDawgVA described himself in an interview with Dexerto as the \"straight man\" to Ironmouse's \"chaotic\" personality, while Ironmouse has considered him \"genuine\".\nIn February 2022, Ironmouse held a subathon event, a nonstop stream in which a countdown clock was extended whenever viewers purchased paid subscriptions or otherwise made donations to the channel. The stream remained online even when she was asleep, during which other content, such as videos, and appearances by her friends and other guests, were featured. Over the course of the event, which ran for a total of 31 days through March 7, 2022, Ironmouse became the most-subscribed to female streamer on Twitch, and had the largest number of active subscribers of all Twitch channels at the time (although short of an overall record set by Ludwig during a similar event he held in 2021), with nearly 172,000 subscribers in total by the end of the event. Ironmouse has occasionally hosted a talk show—Speak of the Devil—which features various guests.\nAccording to data from StreamElements and Rainmaker, Ironmouse was the eighth-most watched streamer on Twitch during the month of February 2022—marking the first time that a VTuber had made their monthly top 10. Discussing the event, Ironmouse felt that it was \"the only time I didn't feel lonely because I felt like I had somebody there all the time. It was the least lonely I've ever felt in a long time.\" In March 2022, she was nominated for Best VTuber at The Streamer Awards.\nIn December 2022, she was listed among the \"heroes\" on the Plasma Hero website for raising awareness about CVID and encouraging viewers to donate plasma. She has also received praise for encouraging donations to The Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF), a charitable organization which helps people suffering from conditions like hers through research and improving the quality of life of people suffering from primary immunodeficiency. According to StreamsCharts, Ironmouse was the second most-watched female Twitch streamer of 2022, behind Amouranth. In March 2023, she won Best VTuber at The Streamer Awards.\nIn June 2023, Ironmouse held a second subathon event as a charity event, with half of all revenue from Twitch subscriptions and Bits, as well as merchandise sales during the event, being donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation. The subathon broke her previous record of 172,000 subscribers and set a new record of 205,488 subscribers. \nOn December 7, 2023, Ironmouse won the award for Content Creator of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, becoming the first VTuber to win in the category. In February 2024, she repeated as Best VTuber and was also nominated for Streamer of the Year at The Streamer Awards.\nOn September 10, 2024, YouTube suspended Ironmouse's VOD channel, supposedly due to copyright strikes. On September 20, her main YouTube channel was also suspended; in response, she tweeted that she was \"incredibly sad and shocked\". Both of Ironmouse's YouTube channels were later reinstated on September 23. On September 24, Ironmouse broke the all-time subscription record for a female streamer on Twitch for the third consecutive year, exceeding her previous record of 205488 subscribers.  That same month, Ironmouse overtook Kai Cenat as the most-subscribed channel on Twitch, setting a new all-time record for the service on September 30. Her record lasted until November 2024, when it was broken by Cenat. In December 2024, Ironmouse once again won the Streamer Award for Best VTuber, and was also nominated for Best Marathon Stream and the Sapphire Award. An annual report from StreamsCharts showed that Ironmouse was the most-watched female streamer on Twitch in 2024.\n\nPhilanthropy and raising awareness\nFrom early in her career Ironmouse has been keen on educating more people on CVID and PI. In an interview with plasma-hero she said, \"At the time, I think I was so worried I didn't realize how talking about it could raise awareness; I don't make my illness the main focus of my content, but I do speak about it from time to time for education and awareness and to explain why I may not be feeling my best at times\". On August 4, 2021, she held a charity event for Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF) and raised over $100,000. This caused many creators like CDawgVA to follow in her footsteps and raise more money for the charity, In an interview with the Immune Deficiency Foundation, CDawgVA stated \"I find that often it’s the people that we really care about who… force us to learn about stuff we’ve been ignorant about or that we’ve allowed to be ignorant about because we haven’t had to deal or be exposed to any of the ideas.\", acknowledging her role in educating him about PI and the Immune Deficiency Foundation. She also did a 30-day subathon in June 2023 and a 39-day subathon in September 2024, where she donated half of all the subscription income to the Immune Deficiency Foundation.\nIronmouse also has raised a significant amount of awareness for donations and the importance of plasma. She stated in an interview with plasma-hero, \"I know so many people encourage blood donation, and I want to make sure I can reach as many people as I can to tell people about living with a PI and donating plasma. I want more people to know that we are here and we need support, but I also want people to know that they are not alone.\" She used her platform to encourage more people to donate plasma and her efforts were well received as more people started to donate plasma, as she quoted in an interview with Dexerto, \"It's really nice to be able to see so many people tweet at me every time I donate plasma, which is something I never saw before, It's just really nice to see the reception that everyone has given me, and the fact that people wanna know more about it, and people wanna donate plasma, and people wanna help out because it's a rare disease, and not a lot of people know about it.\" Her efforts for raising awareness were also well recognized by the Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF), which earned her the \"plasma hero award\" on 2024 PI Conference. She is also artistically involved in raising awareness. On June 12, 2024, Ironmouse released her single \"Carry On,\" which was the ending song for the \"Compromised: Life Without Immunity” documentary by the Immune Deficiency Foundation.\n\nDiscography\nSingles\nCovers\nDuets and collaborations\nFilmography\nVideo games\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nInternet celebrity\nList of most-subscribed Twitch channels\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nIronmouse on Twitter\nIronmouse Model Index",

        "content": "Thomas Chance Morris (born February 15, 1994), known professionally as Sodapoppin, is an American Twitch streamer and YouTuber. He has one of the largest followings on Twitch, with over 8.9 million followers as of November 26, 2024; he also has over 1.1 million subscribers and over 480.7 million views on YouTube. According to Social Blade, Morris sits at the number 16 spot for the most followers on Twitch; he also ranks number 15 for the largest total number of views on the platform. He is a co-owner of and content creator for gaming organization One True King.\n\nCareer\nMorris began streaming on Twitch in 2012 after switching from Xfire.\nIn 2014 and 2015, Morris was streaming blackjack gambling on casino websites, winning and losing thousands of dollars on any given day. In May 2015, Morris lost $5,000 on one hand with over 43,000 viewers watching him.\n\nMorris co-owned Canadian esports organization Northern Gaming, which was founded in May 2016. In August 2017, the organization was purchased by NRG Esports, which is owned by Shaquille O'Neal, Alex Rodriguez, and others. Morris subsequently joined its ownership group and became an advisor of NRG Esports. In regards to Northern Gaming's short-lived career, Esports Insider stated, \"It's the end of a short road for Northern Gaming, but their story will be looked back on as an example of achieving quick success in esports.\"\nMorris has been credited for causing a spike in popularity of social deduction game Among Us, which was originally released in 2018 but exploded in popularity in the summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Forest Willard, programmer and co-founder of Innersloth, \"The first thing we really noticed was a Twitch stream from Sodapoppin. We had various moments where we were like, 'We're doing well,' but it was that point where we saw that a lot of people and other streamers started to climb onboard.\"\nOn July 20, 2020, Morris was banned from Twitch after playing VRChat on stream, where inside the game there's multiple characters that wore revealing clothes that may have broken Twitch’s sexually explicit content rules. He was then unbanned a day later.\nIn October 2021, Morris appeared in the infamous Twitch leaks, which disclosed the top Twitch streamers' revenue from August 2019 to October 2021. Morris placed 43rd on the list, with a reported payout of $1,461,302.14 for this time period.\nOn April 13, 2022, Morris was banned for two weeks from Twitch after a stream he did on April 9 where he applied makeup to a generic face in a game he was playing while declaring “blackface” at the same time.\nOn July 21, 2022, gaming organization One True King announced Morris as their newest member and co-owner.\n\nPersonal life\nMorris is currently in a relationship with fellow Twitch streamer and VTuber Veibae.\nMorris currently owns a blue Porsche 911 GT3, an exotic sports car.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSodapoppin on Twitch",

        "streamer": "ASPEN",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen",
        "content": "Aspen is a common name for certain tree species in the Populus sect. Populus, of the Populus (poplar) genus.\n\nSpecies\nThese species are called aspens:\n\nPopulus adenopoda – Chinese aspen (China, south of P. tremula)\nPopulus davidiana – Korean aspen (Eastern Asia)\nPopulus grandidentata – Bigtooth aspen (eastern North America, south of P. tremuloides)\nPopulus sieboldii – Japanese aspen (Japan)\nPopulus tremula – Eurasian aspen (northern Europe and Asia)\nPopulus tremuloides – Quaking aspen or trembling aspen (northern and western North America)\n\nHabitat and longevity\nAspen trees are all native to cold regions with cool summers, in the north of the northern hemisphere, extending south at high-altitude areas such as mountains or high plains. They are all medium-sized deciduous trees reaching 15–30 m (50–100 ft) tall. In North America, the aspen is referred to as quaking aspen or trembling aspen because the leaves \"quake\" or tremble in the wind. This is due to their flattened petioles which reduce aerodynamic drag on the trunk and branches.\n\nAspens typically grow in environments that are otherwise dominated by coniferous tree species, and which are often lacking other large deciduous tree species. Aspens have evolved several adaptations that aid their survival in such environments. One is the flattened leaf petiole, which reduces aerodynamic drag during high winds and decreases the likelihood of trunk or branch damage. Dropping leaves in the winter (like most but not all other deciduous plants) also helps to prevent damage from heavy winter snow. Additionally, the bark is photosynthetic, meaning that growth is still possible after the leaves have been dropped. The bark also contains lenticels that serve as pores for gas exchange, in which their respiratory function resembles that of the stomata on leaves.\nAspens are also aided by the rhizomatic nature of their root systems. Most aspens grow in large clonal colonies, derived from a single seedling, and spread by means of root suckers; new stems in the colony may appear at up to 30–40 m (100–130 ft) from the parent tree. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the root system of the colony is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. For this reason, it is considered to be an indicator of ancient woodlands. One such colony in Utah, given the nickname of \"Pando\", has been estimated to be as old as 80,000 years, if validated, this would be making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens. Some aspen colonies become very large with time, spreading about 1 m (3 ft) per year, eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive forest fires, because the roots are below the heat of the fire, and new sprouts appear after the fire burns out. The high stem turnover rate combined with the clonal growth leads to proliferation in aspen colonies. The high stem turnover regime supports a diverse herbaceous understory.\n\nAspen seedlings do not thrive in the shade, and it is difficult for seedlings to establish in an already mature aspen stand. Fire indirectly benefits aspen trees, since it allows the saplings to flourish in open sunlight in the burned landscape, devoid of other competing tree species. Aspens have increased in popularity as a forestry cultivation species, mostly because of their fast growth rate and ability to regenerate from sprouts. This lowers the cost of reforestation after harvesting since no planting or sowing is required.\nRecently, aspen populations have been declining in some areas (\"Sudden Aspen Death\"). This has been attributed to several different factors, such as climate change, which exacerbates drought and modifies precipitation patterns. Recruitment failure from herbivory or grazing prevents new trees from coming up after old trees die. Additionally, successional replacement by conifers due to fire suppression alters forest diversity and creates conditions where aspen may be at less of an advantage.\nIn contrast with many trees, aspen bark is base-rich, meaning aspens are important hosts for bryophytes and act as food plants for the larvae of butterfly (Lepidoptera) species—see List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars.\nYoung aspen bark is an important seasonal forage for the European hare and other animals in early spring. Aspen is also a preferred food of the European beaver. Elk, deer, and moose not only eat the leaves but also strip the bark with their front teeth.\n\nImage gallery\nUses\nAspen wood is white and soft, but fairly strong, and has low flammability. It has a number of uses, notably for making matches and paper where its low flammability makes it safer to use than most other woods. Shredded aspen wood is used for packing and stuffing, sometimes called excelsior (wood wool). Aspen flakes are the most common species of wood used to make oriented strand boards. It is also a popular animal bedding, since it lacks the phenols associated with pine and juniper, which are thought to cause respiratory system ailments in some animals. Heat-treated aspen is a popular material for the interiors of saunas. While standing trees sometimes tend to rot from the heart outward, the dry timber weathers very well, becoming silvery-grey and resistant to rotting and warping, and has traditionally been used for rural construction in the northwestern regions of Russia (especially for roofing, in the form of thin slats).\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nFox, Mark, Linda E.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosin-protein_kinase_Lck",
        "content": "Tyrosin-protein kinase Lck (or lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) is a 56 kDa protein that is found inside  lymphocytes and encoded in the human by the LCK gene. The Lck is a member of Src kinase family (SKF) and is important for the activation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling in both naive T cells and effector T cells. The role of Lck is less prominent in the activation or in the maintenance of memory CD8 T cells in comparison to CD4 T cells. In addition, the constitutive activity of the mouse Lck homolog varies among memory T cell subsets. It seems that in mice, in the effector memory T cell (TEM) population, more than 50% of Lck is present in a constitutively active conformation, whereas less than 20% of Lck is present as active form in central memory T cells. These differences are due to differential regulation by SH2 domain–containing phosphatase-1 (Shp-1) and C-terminal Src kinase.\nLck is responsible for the initiation of the TCR signaling cascade inside the cell by phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) within the TCR-associated chains.\nLck can be found in different forms in immune cells: free in the cytosol or bound to the plasma membrane (PM) through myristoylation and palmitoylation. Due to the presence of the conserved CxxC motif (C20 and C23) in the zinc clasp structure, Lck is able to bind the cell surface coreceptors CD8 and\\or CD4.\nBound and free Lck have different properties: free Lck has more pronounced kinase activity in comparison to bound Lck, and moreover, the free form produces a higher level of T cell activation. The reasons for these differences are not well understood yet.\n\nT cell signaling\nLck is most commonly found in T cells. It associates with the cytoplasmic tails of the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors on T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, respectively, to assist signaling from the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. T cells are able to respond to pathogen and cancer using T-cell receptor, nevertheless, they can also react to self-antigen causing the onset of autoimmune diseases. The T cells maturation occurs in the thymus and it is regulated by a threshold that defines the limit between the positive and the negative selection of thymocytes. in order to avoid the onset of autoimmune diseases, highly self-reactive T cells are removed during the negative selection, whereas, an amount of weak self-reactive T cells is required to promote an efficient immune response, therefore during the positive selection these cells are chosen for maturation. The threshold for positive and negative selection of developing T cells is regulated by the bound between the Lck and co-receptors.\nThere are two main pools of T cells which mediate adaptive immune responses: CD4+ T cells (or helper T cells), and CD8+ T-cells (or cytotoxic T cells) which are MHCII-and MHCI restricted respectively. Despite their role in the immune system is different their activation is similar. Cytotoxic T cells are directly involved in the individuation and in the removal of infected cells, whereas helper T cells modulate other immune cells to supply the response.\nThe initiation of immune response takes place when T cells encounter and recognize their cognate antigen. The antigen-presenting cells (APC) expose on their surface a fraction of the antigen that is recognized either from CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells. This binding leads to the activation of TCR signaling cascade in which the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) located in the CD3-zeta chains (ζ-chains) of the TCR complex, are phosphorylated by Lck and less extended by Fyn. Both coreceptor-bound and free Lck can phosphorylate the CD3 chains upon TCR activation, evidences suggest that the free form of Lck can be recruited and trigger the TCR signal faster than the coreceptor-bound Lck  Additionally, upon T cell activation, a fraction of kinase active Lck, translocate from outside of lipid rafts (LR) to inside lipid rafts where it interacts with and activates LR-resident Fyn, which is involved in further downstream signaling activation. Once ITAM complex is phosphorylated the CD3 chains can be bound by another cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called ZAP-70. In the case of CD8+ T cells, once ZAP70 binds CD3, the coreceptor associated with Lck binds the MHC stabilizing the TCR-MHC-peptide interaction. The phosphorylated form of ZAP-70 recruits another molecule in the signaling cascade called LAT (Linker for activation of T cells), a transmembrane protein. LAT acts as a scaffold able to regulate the TCR proximal signals in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The most important proteins recruited by phosphorylated LAT are Shc-Grb2-SOS, PI3K, and phospholipase C (PLC). The residue responsible for the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) is Y132. This binding leads to the Tec family kinase ITK-mediated PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and activation that consequentially produce calcium (Ca2+) ions mobilization, and activation of important signaling cascades within the lymphocyte. These include the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway, which goes on to activate certain transcription factors such as NFAT, NF-κB, and AP-1.  These transcription factors regulate the production of a plethora of gene products, most notable, cytokines such as Interleukin-2 that promote long-term proliferation and differentiation of the activated lymphocytes. In addition to the significance of Lck and Fyn in T cell receptor signaling, these two src kinases have also been shown to be important in TLR-mediated signaling in T cells.\nThe function of Lck has been studied using several biochemical methods, including gene knockout (knock-out mice), Jurkat cells deficient in Lck (JCaM1.6), and siRNA-mediated RNA interference.\n\nLck activity regulation\nThe activity of the Lck can be positively or negatively regulated by the presence of other proteins such as the membrane protein CD146, the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 and C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). In mice, CD146 directly interacts with the SH3 domain of coreceptor-free LCK via its cytoplasmic domain, promoting the LCK autophosphorylation. There is very little understanding of the role of CD45 isoforms, it is known that they are cell type-specific, and that they depend on the state of activation and differentiation of cells. In naïve T cells in humans, CD45RA isoform is more frequent, whereas when cells are activated the CD45R0 isoform is expressed in higher concentrations. Mice express low levels of high molecular weight isoforms (CD45RABC) in thymocytes or peripheral T cells. Low levels of CD45RB are typical in primed cells, while high levels of CD45RB are found in both naïve and primed cells. In general, CD45 acts to promote the active form of LCK by dephosphorylating a tyrosine (Y192) in its inhibitory C-terminal tail. The consequent trans-autophosphorylation of the tyrosine in the lck activation loop (Y394), stabilizes its active form promoting its open conformation which further enhances the kinase activity and substrate binding. The Dephosphorylation of the Y394 site can also be regulated by SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), PEST-domain enriched tyrosine phosphatase (PEP), and protein tyrosine phosphatase-PEST. In contrast, Csk has an opposite role to that of CD45, it phosphorylated the Y505 of Lck promoting the closed conformation with inhibited kinase activity. When both Y394 and Y505 are unphosphorylated the lck show a basal kinase activity, vice versa, when phosphorylated, lck show similar activity to the Y394 single phosphorylated Lck\n\nStructure\nLck is a 56-kilodalton protein. The N-terminal tail of Lck is myristoylated and palmitoylated, which tethers the protein to the plasma membrane of the cell. The protein furthermore contains a SH3 domain, a SH2 domain and in the C-terminal part the tyrosine kinase domain. The two main phosphorylation sites on Lck are tyrosines 394 and 505. The former is an autophosphorylation site and is linked to activation of the protein. The latter is phosphorylated by Csk, which inhibits Lck because the protein folds up and binds its own SH2 domain. Lck thus serves as an instructive example that protein phosphorylation may result in both activation and inhibition.\n\nLck and disease\nMutations in Lck are liked to a various range of diseases such as SCID (Severe combined immunodeficiency) or CIDs. In these pathologies, the dysfunctional activation of the lck leads to T cell activation failure. Many pathologies are linked to the overexpression of Lck  such as cancer, asthma, diabetes 1, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), organ graft rejection, atherosclerosis, hypersensitivity reactions, polyarthritis, dermatomyositis. The increase of the lck in colonic epithelial cells can lead to colorectal cancer. The lck play a role also in the Thymoma, an auto-immune disorder which involve thymus. Tumorigenesis is enhanced by abnormal proliferation of immature thymocytes due to low levels of Lck.\nLymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase (lyp), is one of the suppressor of  lck activity and mutations in this  protein are correlated with the onset of diabetes 1. Increased activity of lck promote the onset of the diabetes 1.\nRegarding respiratory diseases, asthma is associated with the activation of th2 type of t cell whose differentiation is mediated by lck. Moreover, mice with an unbalanced amount of lck show altered lung function which can consequentially leads to the onset of asthma.\n\nSubstrates\nLck tyrosine phosphorylates a number of proteins, the most important of which are the CD3 receptor, CEACAM1, ZAP-70, SLP-76, the IL-2 receptor, Protein kinase C, ITK, PLC, SHC, RasGAP, Cbl, Vav1, and PI3K.\n\nInhibition\nIn resting T cells, Lck is constitutively inhibited by Csk phosphorylation on tyrosine 505. Lck is also inhibited by SHP-1 dephosphorylation on tyrosine 394. Lck can also be inhibited by Cbl ubiquitin ligase, which is part of the ubiquitin-mediated pathway.\nSaractinib, a specific inhibitor of LCK impairs maintenance of human T-ALL cells in vitro as well as in vivo by targeting this tyrosine kinase in cells displaying high level of lipid rafts.\nMasitinib also inhibits Lck, which may have some impact on its therapeutic effects in canine mastocytoma.\nHSP90 inhibitor NVP-BEP800 has been described to affect stability of the LCK kinase and growth of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias.\n\nInteractions\nLck has been shown to interact with:\n\nSee also\nTyrosine kinase\nT cell\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nlck+Kinase at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\nOverview of all the structural information available in the PDB for UniProt: P06239 (Tyrosine-protein kinase Lck) at the PDBe-KB.",

        "content": "Matthew DeLisi (born March 28, 2000), better known as super or supertf, is a former professional Overwatch player from the United States. He competed in the Overwatch League (OWL) as a member of the San Francisco Shock. Prior to his time in OWL, DeLisi played for teams such as -bird noises-, Hammer Esports, and Luminosity Gaming Evil (LGE).\nDeLisi began his Overwatch career with -bird noises- and later joined Hammer Esports, which was then acquired by LGE. In late 2017, he signed with the San Francisco Shock in preparation for the inaugural OWL season in 2018. Being underage initially, DeLisi made his professional debut in April 2018. Throughout his tenure with the Shock, DeLisi achieved numerous accolades, including being a two-time OWL All-Star, an OWL Role Star, an OWL MVP finalist, and a winner of three midseason tournament titles. He also secured two OWL championships in 2019 and 2020, as well as won the 2019 Overwatch World Cup as part of Team USA. DeLisi announced his retirement on March 27, 2022.\nDeLisi's prominence extended beyond his gameplay, as he made two appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon for interviews about the Overwatch League.\n\nEarly life\nDeLisi was born on March 28, 2000, and was raised in Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nProfessional career\nEarly career\nDeLisi's esports journey began in Team Fortress 2 as a member of -bird noises-. However, the team transitioned to Overwatch shortly after his arrival, where he specialized in playing as the tank hero Reinhardt. In January 2017, -bird noises- was acquired by Hammer Esports, which, six weeks later, merged with Luminosity Gaming to form Luminosity Gaming Evil (LGE). During his time with LGE from January to August, the team achieved notable successes, including winning the CyberPowerPC 2017 Extreme Gaming Series minor, securing second place in the Overwatch Carbon Series major, and qualifying for Overwatch Contenders 2017 Season Zero. LGE disbanded in August 2017 as many players on the roster, including DeLisi and the notable DPS player Jake, were expected to sign with teams in the upcoming Overwatch League (OWL).\n\nSan Francisco Shock\nDeLisi joined the San Francisco Shock, the Overwatch League team of NRG Esports based in San Francisco, on September 28, 2017. However, due to age restrictions, DeLisi was unable to compete until March 2018. His Overwatch League debut took place on April 5, 2018, when the San Francisco Shock achieved a 3–1 victory over the Los Angeles Gladiators. With the eligibility of DeLisi and his teammate Jay \"sinatraa\" Won, the San Francisco Shock experienced an upturn in their performance during the second half of the season, achieving a 11–9 record during that time.\nDuring the initial stages of the 2019 season, the prevailing OWL meta involved a team composition of three tanks and three supports. DeLisi, specializing in playing Reinhardt, showcased exceptional skill in this meta and held the record for the fewest deaths among OWL players at various points throughout the season. The San Francisco Shock, as a team, achieved significant milestones by winning the Stage 2 playoffs and finishing as runners-up in the Stage 1 and Stage 3 playoffs. However, the introduction of a 2-2-2 role lock in Stage 4 altered the team composition meta, leading to DeLisi being benched for the majority of the remainder of the season. DeLisi made a notable appearance in the playoffs, helping the Shock secure victory against the London Spitfire. The Shock ultimately triumphed over the Vancouver Titans in the Grand Finals. DeLisi's performance during the 2019 season earned him several accolades. He was selected as a 2019 All-Star and recognized with a Tank Role Star commendation, which was voted on by OWL general managers, coaches, broadcast talent, and the media. Additionally, DeLisi was a finalist for the 2019 Overwatch League Most Valuable Player award.\nDeLisi faced limited playing time at the start of the 2020 season due to the prevailing use of Orisa and Winston as the primary tank choices in the league. However, he made a significant impact when given the opportunity. The San Francisco Shock reached the finals of the May Melee tournament, where they emerged victorious against the Florida Mayhem, with DeLisi showcasing an aggressive playstyle on various maps. As the meta shifted in the Countdown Cup qualifiers, Genji became a popular damage character. Since the Shock did not have a dedicated Genji player on their roster, DeLisi filled the role in a win against the Boston Uprising. The Shock went on to win the Countdown Cup finals against the Philadelphia Fusion, with DeLisi occasionally subbing in as the team's main tank. Despite his limited playing time, DeLisi's was selected to participate in the North America All-Star Game for the second consecutive season. In the playoffs, the meta shifted again, with Roadhog becoming a prominent tank choice. DeLisi was substituted back into the starting roster, primarily playing as Roadhog throughout the playoffs. The Shock secured their spot in the Grand Finals bracket as the top seed from North America. After defeating the Shanghai Dragons in the upper bracket finals, they faced the Seoul Dynasty in the Grand Finals. DeLisi played a crucial role as Roadhog in the finals, helping the Shock defeat Seoul and secure their second Overwatch League championship.\nDeLisi made the decision to retire from professional Overwatch on March 27, 2022, just a month before the start of the 2022 season. He cited the emotional and mental strain caused by the preparation for the upcoming season as the reason for his departure.\n\nNational team career\nDeLisi represented Team USA in the 2019 Overwatch World Cup (OWWC). Throughout the event, he played as Orisa, a hero he had rarely used in the Overwatch League. Team USA progressed beyond the group stages and faced three-time reigning champions Team South Korea in the semifinals. In a 3–1 victory, they defeated Team South Korea and advanced to the finals against Team China. Team USA dominated the finals with a 3–0 sweep, securing their first OWWC title. This achievement made DeLisi one of four players to win both OWL and OWWC titles.\nDeLisi briefly came out to participate in the 2023 Overwatch World Cup as a member of Team USA. The team reached the quarterfinals of the event, where they were eliminated by Team China by a score of 0–3.\n\nEsports ambassador\nAfter winning their first Overwatch League title, DeLisi and teammate Jay \"sinatraa\" Won made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in October 2019, making them the second and third esports professionals to be featured on the show. Throughout the third season of the Overwatch League, DeLisi emerged as a de facto representative of the league, consistently appearing in OWL interviews and amassing a dedicated fanbase. In October 2020, following the Shock's second OWL championship victory, DeLisi returned to The Tonight Show for a second appearance.\n\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\nExternal links\nCareer statistics and player information from the Overwatch League.",

From 2018 to 2023, the Overwatch League followed the model of other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. The league used the\nregular season\nand\nplayoffs\nformat rather than\npromotion and relegation\nused commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on team performance.\nThe Overwatch League was announced in 2016 and secured commitments from 12 teams across the United States, Europe, and Asia, each investing $20\nmillion in franchise fees, to participate in its\n2018 inaugural season\n. The league faced skeptics who questioned its potential success due to the lack of a proven concept and a game without a substantial esports history. For the following season, the Overwatch League brought in eight new franchises, each investing between\n$35 million to $60\nmillion.\nIn 2020, the outbreak of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nled to widespread disruptions and forced the league to abandon its original homestand model and shift to an online format, where teams competed remotely from their respective regions. While the suspension of in-person events provided a temporary solution, it also raised concerns about its financial viability. However, some team owners noted that not having live events allowed them to mitigate financial losses that they would have otherwise incurred. During the 2021 season, in the wake of\na lawsuit filed against Activision Blizzard\n, nearly all of the league's sponsors withdrew their support from the league.\nIn November 2022, a broken partnership with\nNetEase\nand Blizzard resulted in\nOverwatch 2\nbeing banned in China. As a result, the league allowed\nOverwatch Contenders\nteams to compete in its Eastern Region for the following season, and the league saw its first team leave, as the\nChengdu Hunters\ndissolved. In January 2023, Overwatch League teams collectively initiated a\ncollective bargaining\nprocess, which resulted in the Overwatch League agreeing to waive all outstanding franchise fees. By November 2023, Blizzard had announced that Overwatch esports was \"transitioning\" from the Overwatch League into a more traditional esports structure for the title, which would become the\nOverwatch Champions Series\n(OWCS) in 2024.\nFormat\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Overwatch League was owned by Blizzard Entertainment and run by\nMajor League Gaming\n, which is also owned by Blizzard's parent company\nActivision Blizzard\n.\n[\n1\n]\nThe Overwatch League played out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams played scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team\npromotion and relegation\nmore commonly used in other esports leagues.\n[\n2\n]\nThe league featured twenty teams split between two conferences based on their location: East an",

        "content": "Riot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher, and esports tournament organizer based in Los Angeles. It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games and the unrelated first-person shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. Its publishing arm, Riot Forge, oversaw the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers until its shutdown in January 2024. The company worked with Fortiche to release Arcane, a television series based on the League of Legends universe.\nRiot Games operates League of Legends esports leagues and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, which had 23 offices worldwide as of 202, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its leagues. Riot has faced allegations and lawsuits alleging a toxic workplace culture, including gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The company was criticized for its use of forced arbitration in response to these allegations.\n\nHistory\nBrandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill, the founders of Riot Games, became friends while roommates at the University of Southern California, where the two studied business. Beck and Merrill believed too many video game developers diverted their focus from game to game too often, distinguishing Defense of the Ancients as an indication that games could be supported and monetized long-term. They also drew inspiration from Asian video game designers who released their games for no up-front cost, and instead charged for additional perks.\nBeck and Merrill sought funding from family and angel investors, raising US$1.5 million to launch their company. Riot Games was established in September 2006 in Santa Monica, California. The first person Riot Games recruited was Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak, one of the early developers of DotA Allstars, a game considered to have been foundational to the MOBA genre. As they refined League of Legends' initial creation, they pitched investors a video game company rooted in e-commerce. Merrill said that they approached publishers who were baffled by the game's lack of a single-player mode and free-to-play business model. Riot Games received several rounds of funding totaling $8 million, including investments by the Benchmark and FirstMark Capital venture capital firms, as well as Chinese holding company Tencent. The latter would later become League of Legends' distributor in China, and then the parent company of Riot Games.\nFollowing six months of beta tests, Riot Games released League of Legends as a free-to-play game on October 27, 2009. Their game designers and executives participated in online forums to make adjustments based on player feedback. On May 10, 2010, Riot Games announced that they would take over distribution and operation of their game in Europe; to do so, Riot Games relocated their European headquarters in Brighton to new offices in Dublin. In February 2011, Tencent invested $400 million for a 93 percent stake in Riot Games. Tencent bought the remaining 7 percent on December 16, 2015; the price was not disclosed.\nIn 2012, in response to toxicity and harassment in League of Legends, Riot Games launched a \"player behavior team\" of psychologists to combat harassment on its platform. Riot Games' tactics to address issues on League of Legends, which included an opt-in chat function between opposing players, informing banned players of the reasoning behind the ban, as well as creating a tribunal of players to weigh in on bans, resulted in a 30 percent drop in reported harassment behavior. The efficacy of their results has been questioned by players and the gaming press. By 2013, League of Legends was the most-played multiplayer PC game in the world. By 2016, Inc. reported the game had over 100 million monthly players.\nRiot Games relocated to a new building on a 20-acre (8 hectare) campus in western Los Angeles in 2015. In March 2016, Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment, another developer who was working on Rising Thunder and Stonehearth at the time. Rising Thunder was effectively canceled following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to a new project. On October 13, 2017, Beck and Merrill announced that they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming to create new experiences for video game and esports players. Beck and Merrill handed over the day-to-day operations and overall management of the League of Legends team to three longtime employees: Dylan Jadeja, Scott Gelb, and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief financial officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president, respectively. Subsequently, Gelb and Laurent assumed roles as chief operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO), respectively, while Beck and Merrill became the Riot Games' chairmen. As of May 2018, Riot Games employed 2,500 people, operating 24 offices around the world.\nIn October 2019, Riot Games announced several new games: a version of League of Legends for mobile devices and consoles called League of Legends: Wild Rift, a standalone mobile version of the Teamfight Tactics mode from League of Legends, and the digital collectible card game titled Legends of Runeterra, with all three scheduled for a 2020 release. The company also teased further games — Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra – that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips. Project A was later revealed to be Valorant, which entered closed beta on April 7, 2020 and was officially released on June 2, 2020.\n\nIn December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a publishing label headed by Leanne Loombe. The label partnered with smaller game development studios for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in development. Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A League of Legends Story by Airship Syndicate, and Convergence: A League of Legends Story by Double Stallion Games. Another division, Riot Tabletop, was announced in January 2020, to producing tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.\nRiot acquired Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game. Also in April, Riot announced plans to establish a Singapore office later that year. Riot Games Singapore is to support Riot's existing titles and will have a major focus on developing the company's newer titles. Jason Bunge was hired as Riot Games' chief marketing officer in October 2020. In October 2021, the company bought Kanga, a services firm involved in \"fan hubs\", merchandising, and content aggregation.\nRiot Games collaborated with French animation studio Fortiche to release an animated series, Arcane. The series was released worldwide in November 2021 on Netflix, and by parent company Tencent in China, and received a favorable critical reception. In March 2022, Riot Games announced that it had invested in Fortiche and, as a result, its chief content officer Brian Wright and director of corporate development Brendan Mulligan were joining Fortiche's board of directors. That same month, Riot also hired executives from Netflix, Paramount, and HBO Max to head development of film, TV, and music endeavors built around the company's intellectual property.\nIn October 2022, Riot acquired Wargaming Sydney—a subsidiary of Cyprus-based Wargaming that had originally developed the MMO middleware BigWorld—for an undisclosed amount, and renamed it Riot Sydney. The acquisition excludes rights to the BigWorld technology itself, as well as its publishing arm.\nIn January 2023, Riot Games cut 46 employees in a round of layoffs. In the same month, it suffered a cyberattack that stole source code for League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and an anti-cheat platform. The hackers in question put the stolen data up for sale on the dark web for US$700,000. In 2023, several games under the Riot Forge label were released, including The Mageseeker by Digital Sun, and Song of Nunu by Tequila Works. In September 2023, Dylan Jadeja became company CEO.\nRiot announced in January 2024 that it would be laying off 530 employees, or about 11% of its workforce, as well as sunsetting the Riot Forge effort as well as its planned Twitch competitor, Riot Esports Network (REN). Jadeja stated the rationale for the layoffs: \"A decision like this has a massive impact on people's lives and on the culture of Riot. We're not doing this to appease shareholders or to hit some quarterly earnings number – we've made this decision because it's a necessity. It's what we need to do in order to maintain a long-term focus for players.\" In May 2024, the company was sued in the California federal court over its partnership with bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Lawyers for the plaintiff said the claims were brought as their losses from FTX could not be recovered due to the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nEsports\nRiot Games operates esports leagues worldwide. This includes the League of Legends Championship Series, comprising leagues in North America and Europe. In total, there are more than 100 teams in Riot Games' 12 regional leagues around the world. Teams compete over the course of a season separated into two seasonal splits. Teams earn championship points to qualify for two major international competitions: the Mid-Season Invitational and the League of Legends World Championship. Riot Games' World Championship is the annual professional tournament at the conclusion of each season.\nDuring 2010 and 2011, the Riot Games team developed new content for League of Legends; it was during this time that the company realized that people also liked to watch the game being played. As a result, Riot Games established its own League of Legends esports leagues which produce weekly broadcasts and create a professional game schedule. Following Riot Games' first world championship event in 2011, a small affair at a conference in Sweden, the company decided to turn their tournaments into professional sports-like events. It invested in broadcasting equipment, hired sports programming producers, and trained pro gamers to be \"TV-ready\". In 2012, Riot Games held its tournament at University of Southern California's Galen Center, offering $1 million in prize money. Riot Games has since held tournaments in Berlin, Seoul, Madison Square Garden in New York City, and the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\nThe company sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its esports league. In 2015, investors bought stakes in teams and began building their own squads. Among the team owners in Riot Games' leagues are the owners of the Washington Wizards, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Dodgers, AOL co-founder Steve Case, and life coach Tony Robbins. Inc. cited the growth of the leagues and high-profile ownership as part of its reasoning for making Riot Games its 2016 Company of the Year. Following debates over whether pro players and coaches should have a greater share of Riot Games' esports revenue and concerns raised about the company making in-game changes prior to matches, the company issued an open letter in 2016 promising higher revenue shares and more collaboration with professional teams. In 2017, Riot Games held the League of Legends World Championship in China, with the finals taking place in Beijing. The same year, the company announced it would franchise its ten-team North American League of Legends Championship Series, which cost at least $10 million to enter.\nIn November 2020, Riot Games announced the first Valorant Champions Tour, the global competitive tournament for Valorant.\nIn 2021, Riot began building out three new \"remote broadcast centers\" in Asia, North America (Seattle), and Europe (Dublin), as part of an effort to improve the scale of its esports productions using a centralized production model with regional hubs. The facilities would be capable of both on-site productions, and allowing regional productions to connect to the facilities' datacenters and use their infrastructure as part of remote productions. The three locations were chosen as their time zones are each eight hours apart, allowing them to \"work a full shift and then shut down and throw control for the next productions to the next facility.\" The first RBC in Dublin, Ireland, opened in July 2022, in a building formerly housed by the nightclub The Wright Venue in Swords; it has an IP-based infrastructure, six studios, and preserves the nightclub's disco ball (which had been promoted as the largest in Europe).\nAs part of their buildout of the LoL series, Riot partnered with the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in August 2021 for a seven-year deal. Following the bankruptcy of FTX in November 2022, Riot began to seek legal methods to terminate the FTX contract.\n\nCriticism and controversies\nAllegations over gender discrimination and sexual harassment\nOver the first half of 2018, Kotaku spoke to about 28 former and current employees at Riot Games. Several employees claimed that female employees at Riot were being discriminated against. For example, some noted that ideas from female employees were overlooked while the same ideas from male employees were readily accepted, and some female employees were groomed for more senior positions only to be passed up by a new male hire. These employees described Riot's working environment as a \"bro culture\". Other allegations included receiving images of male genitalia from colleagues and bosses, an email thread speculating on what it would be like to penetrate a female employee, and a list shared among senior staff members detailing which female employees they would sleep with. Kotaku speculated that this came from Riot's history of generally catering to \"core\" gamers both in products and in hiring practices, causing the company to favor male employees over females.\nSome Riot employees approached by Kotaku asserted these accusations were not true or were already being addressed; for example, according to the head of the platform, Oksana Kubushyna, efforts to improve the hiring process to be more diverse and inclusive toward women started nine months before article's publication. Riot Games' corporate communications lead Joe Hixson acknowledged the problems and said they did not align with Riot's core values. Furthermore, he said that all Riot employees must be held accountable for the working environment.\nIn the week following Kotaku's article, several more current and former developers came forward to speak on their own experiences at Riot, which included claims of sexual harassment and misgendering. In a statement to Gamasutra, Hixson indicated that the company is taking action based on the story and its response. He elaborated that, in regards to claims of misbehavior by higher-level executives at Riot, the seniority of the individuals would have no impact on disciplinary proceedings. By the end of August 2018, Riot revealed they were implementing seven \"first steps\" to change the company's internal culture in light of the issues raised, including a \"Culture and Diversity & Inclusion Initiative\" priority. To help implement these, Riot hired Frances X. Frei as a senior adviser for diversity, leadership, and strategy.\nAs a response to the Kotaku article, Riot offered a session at PAX West in 2018 for prospective video game developers with a panel and one-on-one sessions to review résumés; the session only admitted women and non-binary people. Members of Riot's game communities expressed outrage at the exclusion of men, while Riot employees defended the decision as such gender-exclusive support was necessary to correct the male-dominated nature of video game development. Some of the feedback towards Riot included harassment and threats. In response to a shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, in August 2018, Riot planned to increase security at its upcoming events. Two employees of Riot attempted to address the feedback from the PAX event; one was fired, and the other left the company. Riot stated that these departures were separate from their Diversity Initiative.\nIn December 2018, Riot's CEO Nicolo Laurent sent an email to all employees stating that following the company's internal investigation, their COO, Scott Gelb, was suspended for two months without pay for workplace misconduct and would take training classes before his return. Riot stated to Kotaku that there were still other cases they were investigating, but they did not involve those as senior as Gelb, and thus they would not discuss these cases publicly. By January 2019, Riot updated the company values on its website, the first time since 2012, to reflect the apparent \"bro culture\" mentioned in the Kotaku report, and by February 2019, had hired Angela Roseboro as the company's chief diversity officer to further help improve their culture by managing all activity related to diversity and inclusion as well as guiding the recruiting team in promoting inclusivity for new hires.\nAbout three months after Kotaku's story, one current and one former Riot employee filed a lawsuit against the company, asserting the company engaged in gender discrimination concerning their pay and position, and that the company had created a \"sexually-hostile\" workplace. The lawsuit seeks to qualify it as a class-action suit, and for damages to be based on unpaid wages, damages, and other factors to be determined at trial. Three other employees followed with their own lawsuits against Riot Games in the months that followed. Riot Games attempted to have two of the suits dismissed in April 2019, citing that the two female plaintiffs of these suits, when hired, had agreed to third-party arbitration rather than taking court action. Internally, several employees of Riot threatened to walk out, an idea that had been around since the first Kotaku article, as alongside the coercion to use arbitration, these employees felt Riot had yet to improve its transparency on the processes and had otherwise continued to retain Gelb despite his suspension.\nA proposed settlement was reached in the class-action suit in August 2019, which would include at least US$10 million in damages to women that had been employed at Riot Games over the prior five years. Representatives of the class indicated that they thought it would lead to change, while Riot said that there were other issues not covered by the suit, and that they also intended to resolve the unacknowledged issues.\nCalifornia's Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) had been investigating claims of gender discrimination at Riot Games since October 2018. In June 2019, DFEH announced that Riot had denied providing them requested documents and were seeking action to compel these documents, though Riot responded by saying that they complied with all DFEH requests. Upon word of the settlement, the department filed a complaint with the court that stated they believed the settlement was far too low, estimating that the lawsuit potentially could have been worth as much as US$400 million. The state's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement also filed a complaint, believing the settlement would release Riot from labor liabilities that had been raised by the lawsuit. Both complaints urged the court to reject the proposed settlement. Riot dismissed the DFEH's larger value to the suit, and denied charges raised by the DFEH that it had colluded with the class's lawyer to reduce the amount they would pay through the settlement.\nAs a result of the state's findings that the terms of the settlement should have been valued higher, the class withdrew the proposed US$10 million settlement and dropped their original legal counsel, bringing on new lawyers who had been involved in prior lawsuits related to the Me Too movement in February 2020. In response, Riot said they found the US$10 million figure \"fair and adequate under the circumstances\" after analysis, but were remaining committed to reaching a resolution. In August 2021, DFEH asserted that Riot was interfering in their ongoing investigations by falsely informing employees that they could not speak to DFEH directly; while the court ordered Riot to issue a memo to all employees that they legally could speak to DFEH, Riot had yet to comply with this order. By the end of 2021, Riot had agreed to a new settlement with the DEFH and employees of $100 million, with $80 million going to the impacted employees. The settlement was approved in July 2022. Riot will compensate 1,548 female employees between $2,500 and $40,000 each as part of the settlement.\nRiot and Laurent were sued by Laurent's former assistant in January 2021 on sexual discrimination charges, which included inappropriate language and labor mistreatment. Riot opened an investigation by three members of its board of directors into Laurent's behavior in response to the lawsuit. They reported in March 2021 that \"We concluded that there was no evidence that Laurent harassed, discriminated, or retaliated against the plaintiff. We have therefore concluded that at the current time … no action should be taken against Laurent.\"\nAlienware which had sponsored Riot's League of Legends esports events, ended its partnership with Riot a year earlier than their contract term in March 2021 due to the ongoing litigation over the sexual harassment allegations.\n\nDispute over forced arbitration clauses\nRiot has also been criticized by its employees for requiring the use of forced arbitration in its employment contracts as a result of the gender discrimination lawsuit. Riot allowed employees to speak anonymously with the press, and indicated their intent to use town hall meetings and smaller group discussions with Roseboro and employees to determine future action. Riot also committed to removing mandatory arbitration in new employee contracts and potentially for existing ones after the current litigation had been settled. Additionally, Riot established a 90-day plan starting in May 2019 to continue to address internal issues related to diversity and inclusion. Despite this, over one hundred Riot employees staged their walkout on May 6, 2019, demanding that Riot end forced arbitration for all past and current employees as well. About two weeks following the walkout, Riot reverted their position, saying that they will not change forced arbitration in existing agreements while the current litigation against the company is ongoing.\n\nOthers\nFreedom of expression\nIn the context of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, Riot Games took action to discourage political statements during its live events, claiming that overt statements on politics, religion, and other sensitive topics \"cannot be fairly represented in the forum [their] broadcast provides\", and has asserted that the company bears responsibility for ensuring \"that statements or actions on [their] official platforms [...] do not escalate potentially sensitive situations.\"\nIn 2019, players discovered that words that are politically sensitive in China, including Tiananmen and Uyghur, were censored in League of Legends. The censorship varied by server and language, with some restrictions being lifted after complaints were posted to Reddit.\n\nGeorge Floyd\nIn June 2020, Ron Johnson, Riot Games' global head of consumer products, shared a Facebook post that claimed George Floyd had been killed by police \"because of his criminal lifestyle\". The company subsequently placed Johnson on leave to conduct an investigation, after which Johnson resigned from the company.\n\nSponsorship with Saudi Arabian city\nRiot had announced a planned partnership with the developing city of Neom in Saudi Arabia in July 2020, with the city to sponsor the upcoming League of Legends European Championship series. Shortly after the announcement, fans of the game, as well as Riot employees, criticized the company over social media and their streaming channels over the partnership, citing Saudi Arabia's record on human rights and the violent attempts to evict the Howeitat tribe from the area during the city's construction. Riot canceled the partnership within a few days in response, apologizing and saying that the partnership had been rushed.\n\nMarketing using a character’s mental health struggles\nRiot was criticized for marketing a new League of Legends character, Seraphine, by creating an in-character Twitter account in which they alluded to her struggles with her mental health, including low self-esteem, anxiety, and impostor syndrome. Some wrote that the account was an attempt to trick players into feeling close to her in an attempt to advertise. Creative director Patrick Morales said that, although he was \"proud\" of the members of the team who worked on the campaign, it had \"an unintended impact outside of the narrative we wanted to tell\".\n\nResponse to Russian invasion of Ukraine\nAfter Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Riot Games did not withdraw from the Russian market after being asked to do so by Ukrainian politician Mykhailo Fedorov. In March 2022, Riot donated the proceeds from battle passes sold in several of its games, as well as profit from some in-game items, to humanitarian relief organizations operating in Ukraine. According to Riot, these donations totaled $5.4 million.\n\nLitigation\nIn 2017, Riot Games filed a lawsuit against Moonton Technology Co., the developer of the mobile game Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, because of copyright infringement, citing similarities between Mobile Legends and League of Legends. The case was initially dismissed in California on account of forum non conveniens. Tencent, on behalf of Riot Games, then filed a new lawsuit in a Chinese court, which ruled in Tencent's favor in July 2018, awarding it $2.9 million in damages.\nIn October 2019, Riot Games filed a lawsuit against Riot Squad Esports LLC, a Chicago-based esports organization founded in March 2019, alleging that Riot Squad intentionally infringed on Riot Games' \"Riot\" trademark.\n\nGames\nMinigames\nRiot Forge\nTabletop games\nIn October 2016, Riot Games released Mechs vs. Minions, a cooperative tabletop game based on League of Legends. Riot's first tabletop game under Riot Tabletop was Tellstones: King's Gambit, a bluffing game for two or four players, released in 2020.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nggChronicle (October 13, 2012).

        "content": "Mira (), designation Omicron Ceti (ο Ceti, abbreviated Omicron Cet, ο Cet), is a red-giant star estimated to be 200–300 light-years from the Sun in the constellation Cetus.\nο Ceti is a binary stellar system, consisting of a variable red giant (Mira A) along with a white dwarf companion (Mira B). Mira A is a pulsating variable star and was the first non-supernova variable star discovered, with the possible exception of Algol. It is the prototype of the Mira variables.\n\nNomenclature\nο Ceti (Latinised to Omicron Ceti) is the star's Bayer designation. It was named Mira (Latin for 'wonderful' or 'astonishing') by Johannes Hevelius in his Historiola Mirae Stellae (1662). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Mira for this star.\n\nObservation history\nEvidence that the variability of Mira was known in ancient China, Babylon or Greece is at best only circumstantial. What is certain is that the variability of Mira was recorded by the astronomer David Fabricius beginning on August 3, 1596. Observing what he thought was the planet Mercury (later identified as Jupiter), he needed a reference star for comparing positions and picked a previously unremarked third-magnitude star nearby. By August 21, however, it had increased in brightness by one magnitude, then by October had faded from view. Fabricius assumed it was a nova, but then saw it again on February 16, 1609.\nIn 1638 Johannes Holwarda determined a period of the star's reappearances, eleven months; he is often credited with the discovery of Mira's variability. Johannes Hevelius was observing it at the same time and named it Mira in 1662, for it acted like no other known star. Ismail Bouillaud then estimated its period at 333 days, less than one day off the modern value of 332 days. Bouillaud's measurement may not have been erroneous: Mira is known to vary slightly in period, and may even be slowly changing over time. The star is estimated to be a six-billion-year-old red giant.\n\nThere is considerable speculation as to whether Mira had been observed prior to Fabricius. Certainly Algol's history (known for certain as a variable only in 1667, but with legends and such dating back to antiquity showing that it had been observed with suspicion for millennia) suggests that Mira might have been known, too. Karl Manitius, a modern translator of Hipparchus' Commentary on Aratus, has suggested that certain lines from that second-century text may be about Mira. The other pre-telescopic Western catalogs of Ptolemy, al-Sufi, Ulugh Beg and Tycho Brahe turn up no mentions, even as a regular star. There are three observations from Chinese and Korean archives, in 1596, 1070 and the same year when Hipparchus would have made his observation (134 BC) that are suggestive.\nAn estimate obtained in 1925 from interferometry by Francis G. Pease at the Mount Wilson Observatory gave Mira a diameter of 250-260 million miles (402 to 418 million km, or approximately 290-300 R☉), making it the then-second largest star known and comparable to historical estimates of Betelgeuse, surpassed only by Antares. On the contrary, Otto Struve thought of Mira as a red supergiant with an approximate radius of 500 R☉, while modern consensus accepts Mira to be a highly evolved asymptotic giant branch star.\n\nDistance and background Information\nPre-Hipparcos estimates centered on 220 light-years; while Hipparcos data from the 2007 reduction suggest a distance of 299 light-years, with a margin of error of 11%. The age of Mira is  suspected to be about 6 billion years old. Its gaseous material is scattered, as much as one-thousandth as thin as the air around us. Mira is also among the coolest known bright stars of the red giant class, with a temperature ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,600 to 2,200 degrees Celsius). As with other long-period variables, Mira's deep red color at minimum pales to a lighter orange as the star brightens.  Within the next  few million years, Mira will discard its outer layers and become a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf.\n\nStellar system\nThis binary star system consists of a red giant (Mira, designated Mira A) undergoing mass loss and a high-temperature white dwarf companion (Mira B) that is accreting mass from the primary. Such an arrangement of stars is known as a symbiotic system and this is the closest such symbiotic pair to the Sun. Examination of this system by the Chandra X-ray Observatory shows a direct mass exchange along a bridge of matter from the primary to the white dwarf. The two stars are currently separated by about 70 astronomical units.\n\nComponent A\nMira A is currently an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, in the thermally pulsing AGB phase. Each pulse lasts a decade or more, and an amount of time on the order of 10,000 years passes between each pulse. With every pulse cycle Mira increases in luminosity and the pulses grow stronger. This is also causing dynamic instability in Mira, resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity and size over shorter, irregular time periods.\nThe overall shape of Mira A has been observed to change, exhibiting pronounced departures from symmetry. These appear to be caused by bright spots on the surface that evolve their shape on time scales of 3–14 months. Observations of Mira A in the ultraviolet band by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown a plume-like feature pointing toward the companion star.\n\nVariability\nMira A is a variable star, specifically the prototypical Mira variable. The 6,000 to 7,000 known stars of this class are all red giants whose surfaces pulsate in such a way as to increase and decrease in brightness over periods ranging from about 80 to more than 1,000 days.\nIn the particular case of Mira, its increases in brightness take it up to about magnitude 3.5 on average, placing it among the brighter stars in the Cetus constellation. Individual cycles vary too; well-attested maxima go as high as magnitude 2.0 in brightness and as low as 4.9, a range almost 15 times in brightness, and there are historical suggestions that the real spread may be three times this or more. Minima range much less, and have historically been between 8.6 and 10.1, a factor of four times in luminosity. The total swing in brightness from absolute maximum to absolute minimum (two events which did not occur on the same cycle) is 1,700 times. Mira emits the vast majority of its radiation in the infrared, and its variability in that band is only about two magnitudes. The shape of its light curve is of an increase over about 100 days, and the return to minimum taking twice as long. Contemporary approximate maxima for Mira:\n\nFrom northern temperate latitudes, Mira is generally not visible between late March and June due to its proximity to the Sun. This means that at times several years can pass without it appearing as a naked-eye object.\nThe pulsations of Mira variables cause the star to expand and contract, but also to change its temperature. The temperature is highest slightly after the visual maximum, and lowest slightly before minimum. The photosphere, measured at the Rosseland radius, is smallest just before visual maximum and close to the time of maximum temperature. The largest size is reached slightly before the time of lowest temperature. The bolometric luminosity is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and the square of the radius, but the radius varies by over 20% and the temperature by less than 10%.\nIn Mira, the highest luminosity occurs close to the time when the star is hottest and smallest. The visual magnitude is determined both by the luminosity and by the proportion of the radiation that occurs at visual wavelengths. Only a small proportion of the radiation is emitted at visual wavelengths and this proportion is very strongly influenced by the temperature (Planck's law). Combined with the overall luminosity changes, this creates the very big visual magnitude variation with the maximum occurring when the temperature is high.\nInfrared VLTI measurements of Mira at phases 0.13, 0.18, 0.26, 0.40 and 0.47, show that the radius varies from 332±38 R☉ at phase 0.13 just after maximum to 402±46 R☉ at phase 0.40 approaching minimum. The temperature at phase 0.13 is 3,192±200 K and 2,918±183 K at phase 0.26 about halfway from maximum to minimum. The luminosity is calculated to be 9,360±3,140 L☉ at phase 0.13 and 8,400±2,820 L☉ at phase 0.26.\nThe pulsations of Mira have the effect of expanding its photosphere by around 50% compared to a non-pulsating star. In the case of Mira, if it was not pulsating it is modelled to have a radius of only around 240 R☉.\n\nMass loss\nUltraviolet studies of Mira by NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) space telescope have revealed that it sheds a trail of material from the outer envelope, leaving a tail 13 light-years in length, formed over tens of thousands of years. It is thought that a hot bow wave of compressed plasma/gas is the cause of the tail; the bow wave is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind from Mira A with gas in interstellar space, through which Mira is moving at an extremely high speed of 130 kilometres per second (290,000 miles per hour). The tail consists of material stripped from the head of the bow wave, which is also visible in ultraviolet observations. Mira's bow shock will eventually evolve into a planetary nebula, the form of which will be considerably affected by the motion through the interstellar medium (ISM). Mira’s tail offers a unique opportunity to study how stars like our sun die and ultimately seed new solar systems. As Mira hurls along, its tail drops off carbon, oxygen and other important elements needed for new stars, planets, and possibly even life to form. This tail material, visible now for the first time, has been shed over the past 30,000 years.\n\nComponent B\nThe companion star is 0.487±0.006 arcseconds away from the main star. It was resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, when it was 70 astronomical units from the primary; and results were announced in 1997. The HST ultraviolet images and later X-ray images by the Chandra space telescope show a spiral of gas rising off Mira in the direction of Mira B. The companion's orbital period around Mira is approximately 400 years.\nIn 2007, observations showed a protoplanetary disc around the companion, Mira B. This disc is being accreted from material in the solar wind from Mira and could eventually form new planets. These observations also hinted that the companion was a main-sequence star of around 0.7 solar mass and spectral type K, instead of a white dwarf as originally thought. However, in 2010 further research indicated that Mira B is, in fact, a white dwarf.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\"Mira (Omicron Ceti)\".

        "content": "Jerma985 (born September 22, 1985), also known as Jerma ( JUR-mə) or Jeremy, is an American live streamer, YouTuber, performance artist, and voice actor known for his elaborate Twitch live streams incorporating surreal comedy. He has been described as an online personality across multiple social media platforms.\n\nEarly life and education\nJerma was born on September 22, 1985, to an Irish American father and Polish American mother. Upon receiving a Bachelor of Science in communication studies, he became a substitute teacher and freelance wedding videographer.\n\nCareer\nEarly work and voice acting\nJerma previously owned a now defunct website called jermanet.com, which contained video and audio clips, largely from his college years.\nHe has voiced characters in multiple indie games, such as \"Matt\" in Galactic Phantasy Prelude, the Engineer in Cryptark, and the Horse Lord Hipparchos in Apotheon.\n\nYouTube\nJerma created his YouTube channel, Jerma985, on June 11, 2011. His content primarily focused on the video game Team Fortress 2, which he used to help raise money for the non-profit organization Camp One Step.\nOn October 8, 2011, Jerma announced his partnership with the online entertainment network Machinima.\nIn March 2014, Jerma released the first \"Jerma Rumble\", an annual production which used the WWE 2K games to make primarily quirky or strange characters, often based on characters from past videos and live streams, and watch them wrestle in-game. In August 2016, Jerma released a live-action wrestling sketch as that year's Jerma Rumble. In 2015, he played multiple low quality Grand Theft Auto clones through the Apple app store, which is, to date, his most-viewed video.\n\nTwitch\nJerma did not fully transition into Twitch streaming until 2016. He primarily streamed video games (such as The Sims) while interacting with viewers in the chat. His streams were heavily comedically-driven, often involving physical sketches or interplay with the virtual audience. After transitioning to Twitch as a main platform, he became well known for his \"unconventional streams\" and green screen performances, which fans used to edit comedic videos, gaining notoriety for his distinctive and atypical live streaming formats and viewer interaction. Notably, a large portion of Jerma's streams and comedic sketches involve attempting to \"trick\" new and unknowing viewers, including acting as a computer engineer, a disgruntled teen living with his mother, a nervous singer, an author, a tired employee, a gambling addict, and many more.\nOn September 21, 2019, Jerma hosted a real-life \"robot carnival\" stream that used viewer-controlled robots, allowing members of the live stream chat to control the aim in carnival games such as ring toss and dunk tank.\nIn March 2021, Jerma hosted a real-life archaeology and geology stream with a paleontologist from the Nevada Science Center. In the stream, he \"unearthed\" Grotto Beasts!, a fictitious trading card game from the 1990s based on Pokémon. The cards were produced in collaboration with multiple artists. Fans played along with the joke, producing fan art in the form of found footage-style art, such as a website for the card game made to resemble a GeoCities webpage from the 1990s. In early 2022, he donated $10,000 to the Nevada Science Center.\nIn August 2021, Jerma began his real-life The Sims-inspired \"Dollhouse\" streams, which he described as his \"biggest project yet\". The first of three streams, entitled \"The Jerma985 Dollhouse\", was aired on August 18, 2021 and began with a prerecorded video of Jerma choosing his outfit. The streams allowed viewers to control Jerma's actions through voting and suggestions, similar to the way one would control a Sims character: keeping him fed, happy, healthy and energetic, leading to a primarily improvised plot and series of events. The Dollhouse series is notable for its high production value, as well as the level of control that viewers were allowed to have over the events of the stream. These streams used a combination of visual effects and a real set in order to portray a scene similar to that of the Sims series.\nOn August 19, 2022, Jerma hosted a streamed baseball game at CarShield Field, featuring the fictitious Jerma Baseball Association. He later compared the game to a  \"live comedy improv show\". During the stream, two fictitious and comedic baseball teams, the Maryland Magicians and the California Circus (made up of semi-professional baseball players and circus performers), played a modified game of baseball with various gimmicks, such as \"Power Cards\" which provided advantages to the team that played them. Jerma played the role of the umpire. The event received financial support from sponsors Fansly and Manscaped.\nOn December 17, 2022, Jerma hosted the 'Jerma Christmas Special', initially posing as a straightforward end-of-year awards stream. Instead, the main channel was then 'hacked' by a character named \"The Extinguisher\", in which he played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's campaign mode as retribution for various broken promises Jerma had made to his community. The awards show continued on an alternate Twitch channel. After an hour of both streams being up simultaneously, Santa Claus appeared and helped the two make amends. This stream was produced by Offbrand and Beyond The Summit.\nAt the end of February 2023, Jerma revealed that Grotto Beasts! was officially being released nearly two years after the initial reveal. The 'revamped' trading card game features artwork from 20 different artists, including Jerma himself. There are currently 200 unique cards with four types: Grottos, Beasts, Wishes, and Challengers.\nOn June 12, 2023, Jerma joined Offbrand, a media production company co-founded by fellow streamer and occasional collaborator Ludwig Ahgren, as chief creative officer. Later that year, Jerma discussed plans for a \"soft retirement\" from streaming, moving into further work with other creators in collaboration with Offbrand. Ludwig later revealed that Jerma stepped down as CCO of Offbrand in June 2024, due to \"personal reasons.\"\nOn May 27, 2024, Jerma admitted to being \"completely retired\" from streaming as a career yet still streamed occasionally. Since January 2025, Jerma has resumed streaming almost daily.\n\nAwards and nominations\nFilmography\nOtto's Big Adventure: A Dog's Day Out!

        "content": "Jay Won (born March 18, 2000), professionally known as Sinatraa, is an American esports player and content creator. Won began his career as a player in the game Overwatch. He initially competed for Selfless Gaming and later joined the San Francisco Shock team prior to the Overwatch League's inaugural season in 2018. In the 2019 season, Won's performances led to him being awarded the Most Valuable Player and won the 2019 Overwatch League Grand Finals. Won also represented Team USA in the Overwatch World Cup from 2017 to 2019. In the 2019 Overwatch World Cup, Won helped the team to claim the championship title. Due to his performance throughout the tournament, Won received the Most Valuable Player award.\nIn April 2020, Won made a transition to the emerging competitive scene of Valorant, signing with the Sentinels. However, he faced suspension in March 2021 following allegations of sexual abuse. Following, Won continued to stay involved in the gaming industry as a content creator.\n\nOverwatch career\nProfessional career\nAfter achieving rankings of second in North America and fifth in the world on Overwatch's competitive mode, Won received an opportunity to try out for Selfless Gaming, an esports team based in Georgia, United States. Although he initially did not secure a spot on the team, he was given another chance a few weeks later. Following a review of his performance by head coach and co-owner Brad Rajani, he was ultimately signed to the team. However, Selfless Gaming disbanded on July 7, 2017, leading to the conclusion of Won's association with the team.\nWith the inception of the Overwatch League approaching in 2018, scouts from the twelve franchises sought to sign players to complete their teams. Won attracted significant attention and sparked a bidding war between NRG Esports and Cloud9. Initially inclined to join the London Spitfire, Cloud9's Overwatch team, Won eventually reconsidered his decision after further discussions with NRG and his parents. He opted to sign a contract worth US$150,000 per year with NRG's San Francisco Shock, three times the league's minimum salary, forging a reunion with head coach Rajani, who became the head coach of the Shock. Due to being 17 years old at the time, Won was ineligible to participate in league matches until he reached the age of 18. He made his Overwatch League debut on March 21, 2018, against the Florida Mayhem. Despite a loss in that match with a score of 2–3, Won quickly demonstrated his skills and solidified his status as one of the league's premier damage players. As he and his teammate Matthew \"super\" DeLisi became eligible to compete around the same time, the team achieved an 11–9 record in the latter half of the season 3.\nIn the 2019 season of the Overwatch League, teams primarily utilized compositions consisting of three tanks and three supports during the first three quarters of the season. During this time, Won, who typically played as the damage hero Tracer, made a transition to playing as the tank hero Zarya. The San Francisco Shock, with Won's contributions, achieved impressive results, posting a perfect +28 map differential in Stage 2, reaching all three stage finals, and securing one stage title. In July 2019, just before the final stage of the season, the league introduced a role lock system, requiring teams to adhere to a composition of two tanks, two supports, and two damage players. Following this change, Won primarily played as the damage hero Doomfist. He concluded the season as the leader in hero damage dealt per 10 minutes and played a crucial role in helping the team achieve a regular season record of 23–5. Won received recognition as a Role Star for DPS and received the Overwatch League Most Valuable Player award. After a loss to the Atlanta Reign in the first round of the 2019 season playoffs, the San Francisco Shock made their way through the lower bracket to secure a spot in the 2019 Grand Finals. In the Grand Finals against the Vancouver Titans on September 29, 2019, Won played in two out of the four maps as the Shock clinched a 4–0 victory and emerged as the champions. Following this Grand Finals win, Won and his San Francisco Shock teammate, Matthew \"super\" Delisi, appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on October 7, 2019 to talk about their victory.\nWon announced his retirement from professional Overwatch on April 28, 2020, citing a \"lost passion for the game\". In recognition of his MVP award, the Overwatch League released a commemorative in-game skin for the hero Zarya on June 16, 2020. However, in March 2021, following sexual assault allegations that emerged, the Overwatch League offered refunds for the skin and removed the OWL Championship and MVP badges from the skin.\n\nNational team career\nWon was selected as a member of Team USA in the 2017 Overwatch World Cup (OWWC). Although the team faced defeat against Team South Korea in the quarterfinals, Won's performance throughout the World Cup caught the attention of NRG Esports CEO Andy Miller, ultimately leading to his signing there. Won was once again selected to represent Team USA in the 2018 Overwatch World Cup. Despite securing the top seed after the group stage, the team experienced a loss in the quarterfinals against Team United Kingdom. \nIn the 2019 Overwatch World Cup, Won once again selected to represent Team USA, marking his third consecutive year participating in the tournament. Joining forces with his San Francisco Shock teammates Matthew \"super\" Delisi and Grant \"moth\" Espe, Team USA showcased their prowess as they navigated through the competition, emerging victorious in every match they played. The team's performance culminated in a sweeping victory against Team China in the OWWC finals on November 2, 2019, securing USA's first OWWC title. Won's contributions earned him the title of OWWC Most Valuable Player. Alongside super and moth, he became one of the four few individuals to have won both Overwatch League and Overwatch World Cup titles.\n\nValorant career\nIn April 2020, Won joined the Sentinels Valorant team, marking his transition into the game after retiring from professional Overwatch. Within a few months, he established himself as one of the top players in the Valorant scene. In the PAX Arena Invitational finals, a North American tournament, Won led all players in assists at 122 and ranked fourth in kills-per-round at 0.90. Sentinels emerged victorious in the final of the tournament on July 26, 2020, defeating Cloud9. Won continued his winning streak by securing another tournament victory on August 2, as Sentinels triumphed over Team SoloMid at the 30Bomb Summer Cup final. During the Pop Flash tournament, the fourth and final North American Ignition Series event, Won delivered an outstanding performance in the group stage against Immortals, earning 402 Average Combat Score, 32 kills, and 11 first bloods. Sentinels secured the tournament title by defeating Team Envy 3–0 in the grand final on August 30. At this point in his career, Won had recorded over 700 assists in professional play, making him the only player worldwide to surpass the 600-assist mark. Won went on to achieve two more tournament victories with Sentinels, winning the JBL Quantum Cup in December 2020 and the Valorant Champions Tour North America Challengers One in February 2021.\nFollowing sexual assault allegations against Won in March 2021, he was suspended by Riot Games while they conducted their investigation into the matter. The Sentinels organization also suspended Won until their internal investigation was completed. On May 17, 2021, Riot Games announced a competitive ruling stating that Won would remain suspended for a total of six months, with the suspension period ending on September 10, due to his alleged failure to fully cooperate with the investigation. As a result of the suspension, Sentinels acquired Tyson \"TenZ\" Ngo to replace Won in the starting roster.\nIn April 2022, Won announced his intention to return to the Valorant competitive scene. However, he did not secure a team signing after the announcement and continued his work as a content creator. In January 2023, Won joined the free agent team Untamable Beasts, which participated in the Valorant Challengers North America open qualifier, ultimately failing to qualify.\n\nPersonal life\nWon was born on March 18, 2000, in Shoreline, Washington. He developed a love for video games from a young age, particularly first-person shooters like Halo 3, Call of Duty and Counter-Strike. In 2014, he won his first cash prize in esports, earning $200 in a Counter-Strike tournament. In high school, he was set to play varsity as the starting second baseman for their baseball team, but he dropped out of traditional high school to pursue a career in esports. As an online name, Won chose \"Sinatraa\", which was inspired by Logic's mixtape Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever, with an added \"a\" since \"Sinatra\" was already taken.\nIn August 2018, he threw the first pitch at an Oakland A's game.\nIn March 2021, Won's ex-girlfriend accused him of sexual assault, which he denied. On April 12, 2022, Dot Esports reported that a police investigation followed, but no advancement was made in the investigation.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Maximilian Miles Christiansen (born September 23), best known under the alias Maximilian Dood, is an American YouTuber and Twitch streamer. Considered a prominent figure in the fighting game community, Christiansen primarily makes video content on various fighting games, such as Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom and Killer Instinct. He is also known for his grassroots efforts to organize fighting game tournaments along with his campaigns to revive various fighting game series.\n\nEarly and personal life\nMaximilian Miles Christiansen was born on September 23, and is a native of Los Angeles, California. Before becoming a YouTuber, he had worked as an animator and illustrator. Christiansen is married; his wife, Jessica, gave birth to their daughter, Ripley, in 2020.\nIn October 2021, Christiansen's financial information on Twitch was revealed after a massive leak.\n\nInternet career\nVideo content\nChristiansen created his Maximilian Dood YouTube channel in 2007, and after being fired from his job as an online video game producer in 2011 began to make videos as a full-time job. His content primarily revolves around fighting games, covering titles from fighting game series such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken and Soulcalibur. He moved his streaming to Twitch as a full-time career with replays on Youtube, until his contract ended in 2024. His first video was in 2013, a streamed video playing against Justin Wong for the original season of Killer Instinct. As of 2024 his YouTube channel has over 1.7 million subscribers and his Twitch channel has over 1,300,000 followers. Christiansen also has a second channel, \"YoVideogames\", which features him playing multiplayer games with friends Matthew Simmons, Kenny O'Brien and Steve Springer.\nChristiansen's style of content combines aspects of informative walkthroughs and reaction-based playthroughs. He created the web series Assist Me! for Capcom's Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 game which discussed the game's mechanics, characters and various strategies with comedic skits in between. In his Mortal Kombat videos, he showcased how to perform different fatalities alongside humorous \"hidden character\" intros. Several of his Mortal Kombat videos which featured such gruesome fatalities were eventually demonetized and age-restricted in 2019, following the release of Mortal Kombat 11. In January 2017, his video on Injustice 2 received coverage for showcasing the improvements made to the character models on the game from its initial footage in 2016, detailing the flaws on character faces such as that of Supergirl and Wonder Woman and speculating that NetherRealm Studios had polished the game before its initial release. Besides fighting games, Christiansen has made videos on other video games such as showcasing a Bayonetta 2 easter egg involving a reference to the Nintendo series Star Fox, which received coverage from Eurogamer in 2014. Christiansen has also made a sizeable amount of content surrounding his favorite game of all time, Final Fantasy VII, and its related titles from the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII Remake project.\nFollowing the closure of Machinima in 2019, Christiansen was dropped from the multi-channel network due to his Assist Me and Boss Rage videos receiving copyright claims for their usage of music.\n\nFGC activities\nAs a prominent member of the fighting game community (FGC), Christiansen is known for organizing grassroots fighting game online tournaments alongside campaigning for the revival of several fighting games. In August 2021, Christiansen created a social media campaign advocating for a rerelease of the 2000 fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which had been delisted from multiple online stores due to licensing issues between Marvel and Capcom; initially slated to make a comeback in Evo 2020, the game ultimately did not make an appearance due to the cancellation of the event. Christiansen's campaign led to #FREEMVC2 trending on Twitter and Mike Mika, the studio head for Digital Eclipse, expressing interest in re-releasing the game. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 was eventually re-released as part of Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics in 2024, with Christiansen present in at least one promotional video for the collection. In June 2019, two years prior to his Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 campaign, he had created a Killer Instinct campaign to revive the series which also trended on Twitter.\nIn January 2021, Christiansen hosted a Killer Instinct tournament which he streamed on Twitch under a partnership with Twitch Rivals. In addition to being a fan of the series, he had previously worked with developer Iron Galaxy to create promotional material and character trailers for the reboot. The stream reached over 41,000 concurrent viewers. On May 24, 2021, Christiansen also hosted a Mortal Kombat X Lives tournament with Ryan \"Mr. Aquaman\" Kablik hosting the qualifiers on his YouTube channel two days prior. However, the tournament was stopped and subsequently postponed due to an incident involving multiple players having their personal information leaked during the livestream. Christiansen and Twitch Rivals announced that they will hold the second part of the event in the future. Christiansen also acted as the director of Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite & Beyond, a mod for Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite that adds new features and implements a cel-shaded art style in response to longstanding criticism of the game's graphics.\n\nOther works\nChristiansen appeared in two episodes of Did You Know Gaming? in 2014, discussing trivia on Street Fighter and Killer Instinct. Christiansen appears as an assist character in the 2022 beat 'em up game Jitsu Squad. In July 2023, a special cosmetics collaboration between Christiansen and Naraka: Bladepoint was released.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nEsports\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMaximilian Dood's channel on YouTube\nMaximilian Dood on Twitch\nMaximilian Dood at IMDb",

        "content": "Warframe is a free-to-play action role-playing third-person shooter multiplayer online game developed and published by Digital Extremes. First released for Windows personal computers in March 2013, it was later ported to PlayStation 4 in November 2013, Xbox One in September 2014, Nintendo Switch in November 2018, PlayStation 5 in November 2020, Xbox Series X/S in April 2021, and iOS in February 2024. Support for cross-platform play was released in 2022. Cross-platform save began in December 2023, rolling out in waves to different groups of players before becoming fully available to all players in January 2024. A port for Android is in development. \nIn Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of suspended animation far into Earth's future to find themselves at war with different factions in the Origin System. The Tenno use their powered Warframes, along with a variety of weapons and abilities, to complete missions. While many of the game's missions use procedurally generated levels, it also includes large open world areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games, as well as some story-specific missions with fixed level design. The game includes elements of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to advance their Tenno with improved gear. The game features both player versus environment and player versus player elements. It is supported by microtransactions, allowing players to purchase in-game items with money, while also offering the option to earn them at no cost through grinding.\nThe concept for Warframe originated in 2000 when Digital Extremes began work on a new game titled Dark Sector. At the time, the company had been successful in supporting other developers and publishers but wanted to develop its own game in-house. Dark Sector suffered several delays and was eventually released in 2008, incorporating some of the initial framework but differing significantly from the original plan. By 2012, in the wake of the success of free-to-play games, the developers took their earlier Dark Sector ideas and art assets and incorporated them into a new project, their self-published Warframe.\nInitially, the growth of Warframe was slow, hindered by moderate critical reviews and low player counts. However, since its release, the game has experienced significant growth. It is one of Digital Extremes' most successful titles, reaching nearly 50 million registered players by 2019.\n\nSetting\nSet in the future, players control members of the Tenno, warriors who have awoken from a millennia-long cryosleep on Earth without memories of their past. In the Origin System (an in-game term for the Solar System), they find themselves at war with the Grineer, a violent war-driven matriarchal race of militarized human clones; the Corpus, a mega-corporation with advanced robotics and laser technology, centered around a religion dedicated to profit; the Infested, disfigured victims of the Technocyte virus; the Sentients, a race of self-replicating machines made by a long-dead transhuman race known as the Orokin; and the Corrupted, brainwashed Grineer, Corpus, and Infested units defending ancient Orokin towers. The Lotus, Tenno's mysterious guide, helps the player through difficult situations, as well as gives hints which help them defeat enemies. To fight back, the Tenno use bio-mechanical suits, the eponymous Warframes, to channel their unique abilities. \nAll of the factions encountered in the game, including the Tenno, were created by or are splinter groups of the old Orokin Empire, which the Tenno learns was an ancient fallen civilization and former reigning power in the Origin System. Although virtually all of them are long dead by the time of the Tenno's awakening, their lingering presence can still be felt throughout the Origin System. Before their fall, the Orokin had realized the Origin System was becoming dangerously depleted of resources, and their solution to keep their empire alive was to colonize new star systems. The Orokin sent out colony ships through the Void, a trans-dimensional space that enabled fast travel between stellar systems. They had also sent out the Sentients beforehand, to arrive in the Tau system first, and terraform it, so the colonists would arrive to garden worlds, capable of supporting human life. None of these residential ships returned, and those they had loaded with Sentients returned with the Sentients now deciding to wipe out the Orokin, leading to the Old War, the creation of the Tenno, and finally, the collapse of the Empire.\nIn the game's \"The Second Dream\" quest, which was introduced in December 2015, the player discovers that the Lotus is a Sentient being known as Natah, rebelling against the Sentient to protect the Tenno, desiring to have surrogate children after losing her ability to procreate. The Lotus' father, Hunhow, sends a vengeful assassin called the Stalker to Lua (the remains of Earth's Moon), which the Lotus had hidden in the Void, to find its secret. The Lotus dispatches the Tenno there to stop the Stalker, arriving too late as the Stalker unveils the entity that the Lotus had protected: a human child known as the Operator, who is the real Tenno controlling the Warframes through the course of the game. The Operator is one of several tenno children that survived the passage of the Zariman Ten 0 colony ship through the Void; the adults have all gone mad from its travel. When the ship returned to the Orokin Empire, the children had all been put to sleep for thousands of years, outlasting the fall of the Empire, to be found by the Lotus and becoming the Tenno (Tenno short for the \"Ten Zero\" of the ship's name). The power of the Void gave these children the power of Transference to be able to control the Warframes, making them powerful weapons in battling the ongoing forces in the Origin System. From this point forward, the player can then engage in missions both as the Warframe and the Operator.\nThroughout various updates, various quests have been released after the Second Dream that elaborates on the story. \"The War Within\" quest introduced the Grineer Queens, rulers of the Grineer, and their asteroid-based Kuva Fortress, also giving the Operator the ability to act fully on their own as another playable entity, rather than a single-use attack. Quests afterward would introduce figures such as \"The Man In The Wall,\" a mysterious entity, presumably from the Void, who takes on the visage of whoever sees them, most often as the playable Operator, and Ballas, one of the last living Orokin, assumed to be responsible for creating the Warframes.\n\nGameplay\nWarframe is an online action game that includes elements of shooters, RPG, and stealth games.\nThe player starts with a silent pseudo-protagonist in the form of an anthropomorphous biomechanical combat unit called 'Warframe' possessing supernatural agility and special abilities, a selection of basic weapons (primary, secondary, and melee) and a space ship called an 'Orbiter', which has an A.I. named 'Ordis' who will refer to the player as 'Operator'. The player's primary goal from this point is to explore the Origin System. Later in the course of the game, the player unlocks the ability to gain direct control of the 'Operator', which is the true Tenno protagonist in physical form (and no longer silent). The Operator can physically manifest themselves in the environment by projecting out of the Warframe, disappear by resuming control of it (a process called 'Transference'), and possesses abilities of their own. After that, the Operator can Transference into a larger, purely mechanical combat unit called 'Necramech', which is the technological precursor to the Warframes. Players can engage in space-bound combat using an auxiliary combat platform called 'Archwing', mounted on a Warframe, which comes with a unique set of abilities. Necramechs and Archwings (in space combat) do not use Warframe weapons, but heavy weapons called 'Archguns', which can be upgraded to be used by Warframes. Late in 2019, an update was introduced to the game letting players pilot and manage a distinct spaceship called 'Railjack', which is a combat vessel, unlike the Orbiter. This was designed as a co-op experience with up to four people working together, performing different tasks to keep the ship operational while destroying enemy ships. A Railjack-focused update was released in 2021, which brought expanded content and a new skill tree aimed at making solo play more accessible.\nThrough the Orbiter's console, the player can select any of the available missions to them. To progress through the Solar System, players must complete Junctions to travel to other planets. These Junctions have a set of tasks that must be met to access the Junction, where the player faces off against an NPC Warframe. Other missions rotate over time as part of the game's living universe; these can include missions with special rewards and community challenges to allow all players to reap benefits if they are successfully met. Aboard the ship, the player can also manage all other functions for their Tenno, including managing their arsenal of equipment, customizing their Warframe and weapons, crafting new equipment, and accessing the in-game store. Missions can be played alone or with up to four players in a player versus environment cooperative manner, and are generally played on randomly generated maps composed of \"tiles\" of map sections. Missions have various objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies (Exterminate), stealing data from terminals without raising enemy alarms (Spy), rescuing and escorting prisoners (Rescue), or defending points on the map for set periods (Defense). Later updates have added three large open-field environments where numerous bounties can be completed.\nPlayers can use their weapons, abilities, and several parkour style moves to navigate through and overpower forces within the mission. Downed players may choose to revive themselves up to a maximum of four times which can be increased through equipping Arcanes on the warframe that are rank three or higher. Once complete, players are rewarded with in-game items, as well as in-game currency and items picked up while exploring the map; failure to complete a mission causes these rewards to be lost. In addition to cooperative missions, the game includes player versus player (PvP) content through the multiplayer 'Conclave', which also rewards the player for placing high in such matches.\nPlayers and their equipment also gain experience and level up from missions; equipment with higher levels support more 'Mods', abstracted upgrades (presented as cards in the game's UI) that can be slotted into the equipment to change its attributes or provide benefits, or sometimes negative, bonuses and abilities. Mods are dropped by enemies during missions and may be part of the rewards, and are generally given out following a rarity distribution, with more powerful mods being more elusive to acquire. The most advanced weapon Mods, called 'Riven Mods,' have randomized stats, based on a prefix/suffix system characteristic of ARPGs. Alongside mods, players have other means of improving their equipment, including conditional upgrades called Arcane Enhancements and, for a few weapons, fusing an item with another of its kind to get a superior version. Another type of reward is equipment blueprints, which can be used to construct new Warframe parts or weapons; blueprints and their resulting equipment may also be purchased directly using Platinum, the game's premium currency that can be traded for with other players for rare items in-game, or be purchased via microtransactions. Players need to have specific quantities of construction resources (found from missions and their rewards) to build these items.\nWarframe is designed to be free-to-play, and has avoided using pay to win elements; all Warframes, weapons, and other non-cosmetic equipment can be acquired in-game over time through normal gameplay, which may involve grinding. Spending the in-game currency can simplify and quicken the process. New weapons, Warframes, equipment, and blueprints to construct such equipment and cosmetics like skins and capes (called 'Syandanas') can be purchased in the market, using either Credit, which are earned in-game, or Platinum. Some cosmetic items can only be obtained through in-game payments. However, some indirect upgrades can only be bought with Platinum, such as arsenal slots for Warframes, weapons, and certain other equipment, though they can be unlocked via a \"Nightwave\" battle pass-esque reward system, which is completely free. The premium currency Platinum can be acquired for free by trading for it with other players using certain in-game items.\n\nDevelopment\nDark Sector as a precursor\nThe origins of Warframe came out of Canadian studio Digital Extremes' original vision for their previous game Dark Sector. Before that point, Digital Extremes was known as a work-for-hire studio, working alongside other studios to help complete development; this included working with Epic Games for Unreal Tournament (1999) and its sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 and Unreal Tournament 2004. Epic had looked to bring Digital Extremes into their studio, but found there would be issues with the Canadian government that interfered with the merger, and the studios agreed to go their separate ways. This was the major reason the physical disc copy for the game was discontinued.\nWanting to establish themselves as a lead studio, Digital Extremes came up with the idea of Dark Sector, which they first announced in February 2000, describing the game as combining \"the intense action elements of Unreal Tournament with the scope and character evolution of a persistent online universe\". In early interviews, Digital Extremes said that the gameplay for Dark Sector would have had players as bounty hunters and assassins in a dark science fiction setting, with each character having a bounty on their head, making them targets for other players.\nThe studio used their vision of Dark Sector to try to secure a publisher, but this only led to more offers for work-for-hire. The company remained quiet on Dark Sector for about four years, re-announcing in early 2004 a revised Dark Sector, now to be a stylish, science-fiction single player experience with stealth elements inspired by the Metal Gear Solid series, and a story they considered a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Dark Crystal set in space, within a larger setting like that of Frank Herbert's Dune universe. Much of the game's art style was informed by the French artist Jean Giraud, aka Moebius. The player-character, belonging to a race called the Tenno, and enemies would wear high-tech suits that would give them unique abilities. This re-announcement included a scripted demo to show their vision of the game's gameplay and graphics. The game was announced just as both the first consoles of the seventh generation, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, had been teased, and Digital Extremes started to look for a publisher to release the games on these platforms. The game received a good deal of attention from its video, including coverage by CNN on the upcoming console generation.\nDigital Extremes' creative director Steve Sinclair spent about a year on the road following the re-announcement of Dark Sector to find a publisher, but most rejected the idea; Sinclair said most publishers were not impressed with the science fiction setting and instead encouraged them to change the setting to modern-day, within World War II (which was popular at the time due to the Call of Duty series), and even the American Civil War. When Sinclair returned to the studio, they tried to rework the setting, even trying a superhero genre, without luck. Matters were complicated as they were also attempting to develop their engine, the Evolution engine, to support the game and the new consoles, switching away from the familiar Unreal Engine. Ultimately, Digital Extremes dropped most of the science fiction elements, and moved the gameplay towards a more Resident Evil survivor-horror approach. Digital Extremes did keep one element of the original concept for the released game, that is the protagonist named \"Tenno\". The Dark Sector released in 2008 was far different from their original vision. Dark Sector received average reviews, and was not a major financial windfall for the studio, leading them back to doing work for hire over the next four years, including BioShock, BioShock 2, Homefront, and The Darkness 2.\n\nProduction\nAround 2011, Digital Extremes were finding themselves struggling for work-for-hire contracts. While the studio had been forced to issue some layoffs, they were still at about 250 people at this time. Looking again to develop their IP and to try to take advantage of the growth in free-to-play games, Digital Extremes looked back to the original Dark Sector concept from 2004 and looked to develop it as a free-to-play game. This decision was made in early 2012 and required the team to create a prototype within one to two months, as Sinclair and Digital Extremes' CEO James Schmalz were going to shop the game around to publishers at that year's Game Developers Conference in March 2012. They took several assets from the abandoned 2004 concept, and developed this as Warframe. At GDC, Sinclair and Schmalz found publishers still cold on the idea: Western publishers were not keen on the science fiction setting, while a large unnamed Korean publisher warned him they would \"fail\" as Western developers did not know how to properly support free-to-play games with quality content. Another concern raised by these publishers was that Warframe was based on player-versus-environmental gameplay, which differed significantly with other free-to-play titles at the time that were mostly player-versus-player. Disheartened, they returned to the studio and decided that they would publish Warframe on their own. They built out a playable version of the game, at the time known as Lotus in about nine months. Alongside this, the studio developed the necessary server architecture to support the game and the microtransaction system they had envisioned for it.\n\nStatus\nOriginal release\nWarframe was publicly announced in June 2012 with its closed beta launched in October 2012. Player feedback helped to refine the game's structure. An early change in the beta in early 2013 was their monetization scheme to avoid pay to win scenarios. For example, initially, each Warframe had a skill tree that the player could unlock completely through missions and gaining experience. An extended version of the tree was available if the player augmented the Warframe with an in-game item, then only purchasable through microtransactions. When players complained about this feature, they stripped the pay-to-win elements and adopted the mantra of keeping the game free to play, requiring that players did not have to spend any money to get an item within the game. To support the game, they borrowed the idea of offering for sale \"Founder's Packs\" that would grant in-game items and currency, an idea that had been successfully used on Kickstarter projects.\nDigital Extremes found it difficult to get attention from the press as around 2012–2013, free-to-play games were typically shunned by game journalists. Unfavorable comparisons had been made to Destiny, a highly anticipated title due out in 2014, that also tarnished Warframe's presence. Coupled with low player counts, Digital Extremes were not sure how long they could continue supporting the game. However, Digital Extremes found they had a small but dedicated group of players that latched onto the title, buying into the game through Founder's Packs, telling their friends about the game, and interacting with the developers to provide feedback which was integrated into the game's design. Further, they discovered that when popular streamers like TotalBiscuit covered the beta, they drew more players to the game.\nThe open beta for Warframe launched in March 2013 for the Windows platform, with the game available from their server systems. Warframe was released at the same time that the studio was also completing development for the April 2013 Star Trek game to tie into the release of the film Star Trek Into Darkness. The Star Trek game was critically panned, leading to financial hardships at the studio and forcing them to lay off developers. Warframe itself was not a critical hit with gaming publications, receiving average reviews; as IGN reviewed in 2013, the game was \"fun, but a little bland\".\nDigital Extremes was planning to release Warframe for the PlayStation 4 as well, but that console was not available until November 2013, so to try to get more players, they decided to offer the game on Steam, which further grew the player base. Some days after the Steam launch, Digital Extremes had been able to start drawing in enough funding to maintain the viability of the studio. The PlayStation 4 version was released at the console's launch in November 2013, The Xbox One version of the game launched on September 2, 2014. The PS4 version was ported to Japan on February 22, 2014, followed by the Xbox One version on September 2, 2014.\n\nPerpetual beta\nOnce the game turned profitable, Digital Extremes found themselves in the position of needing to generate content for the game to maintain its audience. Because they retained their 250-person staff throughout this process, they were able to expand upon content quickly and soon hired another 250 developers for Warframe. Community input was critical for Digital Extremes for new content and improvements. One major change after release was an update to the game's movement system, titled \"Parkour 2.0\", which was released in 2015. They had found before this, players discover ways to rapidly traverse levels by a trick known as \"coptering\" using specific weapons, Warframes, and upgrades. Though Digital Extremes had considered these movements to be game-breaking and considered removing the abilities altogether, they realized players liked to have exotic moves like this available to them and thus created the Parkour 2.0 system that, while reining in how extensive these moves could be, fully supported the type of ninja-like movements that players wanted. Another example was a short-lived feature that allowed players to spend a small amount of the premium in-game currency Platinum to get a random color that they could use for customization. Players reacted negatively to this, as some found it would take a large amount of Platinum to get the color they wanted. Digital Extremes removed this random factor and instead added means to purchase such customization options directly.\nThe studio had found it important to release new content regularly to keep a stream of income from the game. They were also faced with the problem that understanding all of Warframe's systems required some commitment by the player, and players that felt it was too much would wash out after a few hours.\nIn 2014, Digital Extremes was acquired by the Chinese investment company Leyou. Leyou since provides necessary funding for Digital Extremes to grow, but has little influence on the direction that the developers take Warframe.\nThe developers are intending to keep the game forever in a beta state.\n\nSwitch, ninth generation consoles, and cross-platform play\nA Nintendo Switch version was announced in July 2018 and was ported by Panic Button, and was released on November 20, 2018. The various versions of Warframe currently support full cross-platform play across several devices, with options to link their accounts to other consoles. In honor of the Nintendo Switch version, Nintendo added the character Lotus and her enhanced form Natah into Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit; the addition was considered to be bizarre as Digital Extremes had next to no ties to Nintendo and Warframe lies outside of Masahiro Sakurai's repertoire of game references.\nAs of December 2020, Leyou has been bought by the Chinese company Tencent for a $1.5 billion deal meaning that Digital Extremes is now owned by the Chinese company which also has stakes in Epic Games, Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft. Within the community of Warframe, voices of concern were outed by the acquisition and the possible meddling of Tencent in the continuation of the game. Digital Extremes published a statement explaining about the deal and the consequences and reassuring that the new ownership will not impact the game whatsoever.\nDigital Extremes announced that they will bring Warframe to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S upon their release in 2020. A port developed by Blind Squirrel Games for iOS was announced on February 15, 2024, with it being released 5 days later on February 20 the same year. A port to Android devices was announced in late December 2024.\n\nExpansions\nSince its release, Digital Extremes has supported Warframe with patches and expanded the game through major updates. These updates have included major gameplay overhauls, such as its \"Melee 2.0\" combat system to give players a wider array of combat moves, additional planets and missions, story elements, limited-time and seasonal events, and new gameplay modes, alongside regular addition of new Warframes, weapons, and other equipment to procure.\n\nThe Second Dream\nIn December 2015, Digital Extremes released Warframe's first cinematic story quest, \"The Second Dream\". This quest features prominent characters from the game and introduces a new faction, the dreaded Sentients. Also, and most importantly, The Second Dream serves as an \"Awakening\" to Tenno's true nature, as more than a mere Warframe, \"more than human, but once a child, like any other\". Completion of this quest grants access to a new game mechanic named Focus and allows the player to enter the battlefield as themselves, temporarily, through Transcendence. During Transcendence, the Warframe is temporarily deactivated, and a spectral form of the Tenno enters the battlefield, channeling one of five Focus Abilities, depending on which of the five Focus Schools the player chose during the quest's events.\n\nThe War Within\nIn November 2016, Warframe's second cinematic quest was released, titled \"The War Within\". This quest sends the player on the chase for Teshin, the master and overseer of the Conclave, as he is seen suspiciously searching the pods of the newly awakened Tenno. Tracking Teshin across the Origin System leads to the discovery of the Kuva Fortress, a massive asteroid under Grineer control where the (so far only known as a legend) Twin Grineer Queens reside. The Queens are shown to have their origins as far back as the old Orokin Empire, and Teshin is revealed to be a Dax Soldier, meaning he was under their command due to them being of Orokin origin thus gaining the ability to wield the Kuva Scepter. The Queens cause an overload on the connection between Tenno and Warframe, forcing the Tenno to seek them out themselves, slowly discovering their Void powers. On the mission's climax, the Tenno unlocks Transference (which replaces Transcendence), an ability that allows them to roam independently of their Warframe at will, weakens the Elder Grineer Queen, and has the option to kill her or \"Let her rot\", since all Grineer bodies decay over time due to excessive cloning. This quest also introduces a moral alignment system to the game, with possible options being Sun, Neutral, and Moon. This alignment has so far not had any consequence in gameplay, leaving its purpose unknown.\n\nPlains of Eidolon\nAn update to the game in November 2017, titled \"Plains of Eidolon\", added an open-world area to the game. The Plains is a semi-open world, initially accessible through a \"hub\" named Cetus, a settlement on Earth where people named the Ostrons reside, then directly through the player's ship. As the game describes them, the Ostrons are \"A tight-knit band of hucksters and merchants.\" This expansion added Warframe's first open-world experience to the game, the ability for the player to gain reputation with the Ostrons, side-activities of fishing and mining, a Bounty system, consisting of five missions of ascending difficulty, where the player can choose to play any mission they would like regardless of whether the previous ones have been completed, a new quest named Saya's Vigil which rewarded the blueprint for the Warframe Gara, more customization options for the Tenno's combat pets, Kubrows (dogs) and Kavats (cats/ocelots), and the ability for the Tenno themselves to wield their modular weapon, called an Amplifier (or Amp, for short) as well as another modular blade called a \"Zaw\". Finally, the \"Plains of Eidolon\" offer a new series of boss fights to the game: the titular Eidolons. These Sentient-origin titans require extreme gear and in most cases teamwork to take down for unique rewards.\n\nThe Sacrifice\nAn update to the game in June 2018, titled \"The Sacrifice\", added the third cinematic story to the game. Following on the events of Warframe's previous cinematic story quests, The Second Dream and The War Within, The Sacrifice sends the Tenno on a hunt across the Origin System for a rogue Warframe known as Excalibur Umbra. This quest provides insight into Umbra's past, the ability to gain Umbra into the arsenal after the quest's climactic point, and information on the origins of the Warframes themselves, answering multiple questions, but creating even more. The Sacrifice also features the alignment system introduced in \"The War Within\".\n\nFortuna\nThe expansion \"Fortuna\" was released on PC on November 8, 2018. The update focuses on the titular Fortuna Solaris Debt Internment Colony, which serves as a hub for the game's second open-world map, Orb Vallis. The people of Fortuna (known as the Solaris) were enslaved by a Corpus known as Nef Anyo who uses ancient Orokin devices that made gallons of coolant for the workstation and trade center on Venus. The area expands upon concepts introduced in Plains of Eidolon, along with new activities, and the ability to obtain a hoverboard-styled vehicle known as a K-Drive. This update also adds more modular items such as a plasma pistol called a \"Kitgun\", and a robotic companion called a \"MOA\".\n\nEmpyrean\nThe \"Empyrean\" update was revealed during TennoCon 2018 in July of that year and released on December 12, 2019. The update allowed players to construct a Railjack, an upgradeable spacecraft inspired by FTL: Faster Than Light. Players will be able to gain non-playable characters to populate the ship, customize the ship, and add upgrades. The Railjack can be used in larger space-based missions, including space battles with enemy forces. Additionally, the game was planned to gain a system similar to the Nemesis system in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and feature boss characters that the player would fight multiple times, with the boss changing its armaments and tactics based on the past fights with the player. Empyrean update was released in 3 phases, with the first phase released on the PC build of the game on December 12, 2019.\n\nThe Old Blood\nWarframe's planned nemesis system was launched on October 31, 2019, as the second phase of Empyrean, with the Nintendo Switch launch delayed to November 19, 2019. This update revealed the nemesis as a \"Kuva Lich\" - A once-ordinary Grineer grunt, turned super-soldier through infusion with a mystical resource named Kuva. This enemy establishes their influence over planets in the Origin System, builds a following of \"Thralls\" which can be defeated to reveal hints on how to defeat the Lich permanently, steals resources from the player if they finish a mission in Lich territory, and has unique personalities, weapons, appearances, and semi-randomly generated names and weaknesses, resistances, and immunities to different types of damage. A Lich can be generated in missions against the Grineer faction by performing an execution on a special enemy named a \"Kuva Larvling\". Said executions are performed with a newly introduced special weapon named the Parazon - a small blade attached to a rope equipped on the Warframe's wrist. The Parazon is also used to execute Thralls and specific enemies, for the game's Hacking minigame, and visually in some cutscenes. The Old Blood also introduced Grendel, the game's 42nd Warframe, together with his signature weapon. Two earlier Warframes, named Vauban and Ember, were adjusted to better function in the game's current state. Additionally, the game's \"Melee 3.0\" system had its release completed.\n\nWarframe Revised\nWarframe Revised, a major quality-of-life update, was released on 20 May 2020. While it didn't add any new content, it served to improve existing gameplay by modifying key aspects of gameplay, such as revising the Kuva Lich system by improving progression speed and allowing players to preview the weapon their Lich would spawn with, allowing them to make a more informed choice as to whether or not to create a Lich, in addition to fixing a lot of bugs and problems associated with Railjack gameplay. It also added a brief invulnerability period for players after their energy shields were depleted, as well as modifying player health so that they no longer had weaknesses to certain damage types. One major part of the update was that it removed Warframe's controversial explosive self-damage system and replaced it with a temporary stagger mechanic depending on how close the player is to their explosions. Self-damage was infamous for its tendency to instantly kill players without warning since it was based on the damage of the player's weaponry, which in almost all cases was extremely high, a problem that only intensified when combined with the cramped nature of the game's procedurally generated tilesets.\n\nHeart of Deimos\nWarframe's third open-world update was announced via the game's official YouTube channel on July 20, 2020, and was released on August 25, 2020, for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, and on August 27, 2020, for Nintendo Switch. It is the game's first expansion to receive a simultaneous release across multiple platforms. The update adds Deimos, one of the two moons of Mars, as a new playable location within the game's Solar System. Deimos includes the Cambion Drift, an Infested open-world area that is smaller on the surface than the other two open-world areas but features procedurally generated underground tunnels. Much like the \"Fortuna\" and \"Plains of Eidolon\" updates, Deimos also contains a social hub called the Necralisk that houses the Entrati, an Orokin-era family known for creating the first technologies that could harness the power of the Void. Alongside Deimos came the introduction of the Helminth system, which adds the functionality for players to \"infuse\" new abilities on Warframes, including abilities from other Warframes. Additionally, the Heart of Deimos introduced Necramechs to the game, which are mech suits built and controlled by the player that feature their unique abilities. Lastly, this expansion brought some improvements to the game's new player experience, mainly consisting of a reworked tutorial that includes a new cinematic intro film directed by Dan Trachtenberg, which first premiered at TennoCon 2019. The film was produced by Digic Pictures using a combination of motion capture and CGI.\n\nDeimos Arcana\nWarfame's Deimos expansion was released on November 19, 2020, for PC. It adds new weapons and a new Necramech \"Bonewidow\". It was also planned to release with Lavos, an alchemist Warframe but was delayed due to Covid. It also added numerous quality-of-life changes and new setting options.\nWarframe's second Deimos expansion was released on December 18, 2020, for PC, then was released on January 21, 2021, for Console. This was a one-month event following the Tenno's victory and the Sentients' defeat in Operation: Scarlet Spear, Erra, and the Sentients have retreated and gone into hiding. The second Sentient invasion in the Origin System thus begins, and the Orphix Sentient Units return. This time, they have been taught to override Warframes by deploying weaponized pulses cleverly designed to disable them, leaving the Necramechs as Tenno's last option.\nDuring the Operation, Natah transmits messages to the Tenno, revealing that she was the one who taught the Orphix to disable Warframes. Her messages about deploying the Orphix series, containing a letter followed by a number, reveal a code from ordering the numbers, which says: \" I AM DYING\".\nFather in the Necralisk on Deimos will have a shop where players can spend their earned Phasic Cells, including a brand-new Warframe, his helmet, and his weapon, new Necramech mods and cosmetics, and items.\n\nCorpus Proxima\nThe Corpus Proxima expansion was released on March 19, 2021. It aimed to simplify the Railjack component of the game by making it easier to acquire a ship with fewer components, eliminating the need to have a Clan Dojo, and the ability to buy a complete Railjack from the game's stores. It also included additional Railjack missions through additional sectors/planets. Players could also recruit crewmates for their Railjacks to man the ship's guns or maintain the ship while the player is away, as well as train them for specific tasks and give them their weapons. Three new Proxima regions were added to the Railjack system: Neptune, Pluto, and Venus Proxima.\n\nSisters of Parvos\nThe Sisters of Parvos expansion was released on July 6, 2021, introducing the eponymous Sisters of Parvos, the Corpus equivalent to the Grineer Kuva Liches, who function in a similar way to them. The Sisters of Parvos are members of Parvos Granum's board of directors, given unusual powers of immortality that must be broken in the same way as a Kuva Lich. The Sisters are armed with upgraded versions of standard Corpus weapons and are accompanied by a robotic Hound which serves as the equivalent of Kuva Thralls. The expansion also introduced some changes to the way the player combats their Lich or Sister, with the enemy fleeing to one of the Proxima regions upon their \"Requiem\" sequence being completed, requiring the player to take them on in a short Railjack sequence before boarding their ship for the final confrontation. The Expansion also introduced the 47th Warframe Yareli, which has an aquatic theme, as well as special \"Galvanised\" mods for ranged weapons due to player complaints that they weren't performing as well as their melee counterparts in high-level content.\n\nThe New War\nThe New War expansion was released on December 15, 2021. The New War quest follows after The Sacrifice and Prelude to The New War. Ballas, along with Hunhow's son Erra wage war against the entire Origin System, prompting former enemies to become allies against a heavy threat, but all is lost after the Sentients successfully manage to take down the alliance. A new empire is born, named Narmer, and its influence becomes consequential. Ordis, now with an ally, must find the Operator and end Ballas for good. This quest will open more questions regarding the philosophy of time, as well as answer the reason why the Operator owes the 'Man in the Wall'. Acquisition of a Railjack and a Necramech, as well as completion of some previous quests, is required to play The New War.\n\nAngels of the Zariman\nThe Angels of Zariman expansion was released on April 27, 2022. Adding to the ongoing theme of temporal paradoxes, the Zariman returns to the Origin System. The ship, which was previously thought to be destroyed, is now haunted by spectral Void entities, including \"Angels\", towering, humanoid Void abominations. This update also overhauls several basic enemy classes, notably Eximus enemies, making them much more resistant to damage and overall more dangerous, and deeply changes the Focus system and Operator gameplay to integrate them more with general Warframe gameplay. The Tenno are tasked by the resurrected crew of the Zariman to protect the ship from being overrun by Void entities and external invaders (Corpus and Grineer troops) while helping them piece together their memories of the destruction of the original Zariman ship. This update also introduced the 49th Warframe Gyre, as well as a unique class of transforming weapons known as \"Incarnon\" weapons, alongside unique \"Voidshell\" cosmetic skins for Warframes, allowing players to pick out different materials for an added layer of customization.\n\nVeilbreaker\nThe Veilbreaker expansion was released on September 7, 2022. The development features the return of Grineer soldier Kahl-175, previously playable during the New War quest. After freeing himself from Narmer's control, Kahl, with the help of Daughter Entrati and the Tenno, has emerged as the Origin System's newest hero, intending to 'break Narmer' by freeing its captives, disrupting their operations and destroying their armies. Kahl is playable during weekly \"Break Narmer\" missions and features a more traditional cover shooter style of gameplay, in contrast to the fast movement and parkour of the Tenno. The expansion also introduces Kahl's Garrison, a camp on Earth founded by Kahl as both a base of operations and a settlement for any captives freed during Kahl's missions. Here, the player can customize Kahl with various colors, materials, and armor pieces, as well as purchase items in exchange for Stock, a trading currency collected from completing challenges during \"Break Narmer\" missions. Veilbreaker also introduces Archon Hunts, challenging missions where players must hunt down and defeat the Archons, monstrous Sentient-Warframe hybrids created during the Old War, previously fought as bosses during the New War quest. Veilbreaker also made several quality-of-life changes to certain game functions, introduced the 50th Warframe, the Spartan-inspired Styanax, and distributed him for free for a limited time between 7 and 21 September to celebrate this milestone.\n\nThe Duviri Paradox\nThe Duviri Paradox expansion was released on April 26, 2023. It details the origins of the Drifter—an temporally paradoxical, adult version of the Tenno/Operator—who first appeared during The New War. This update introduced a new landscape, Duviri, as well as three gamemodes for it. Duviri features roguelike gameplay, with players having to pick a Warframe and Weapons from a set of randomized choices, as well as 'Decrees', upgrades limited to the playthrough they were collected in, with permanent upgrades available after long-term gameplay. In Duviri, the player is mostly restricted to using the Drifter, with Warframes being available with certain upgrades as well as in a location called the 'Undercroft'. The Drifter's gameplay is similar to that of The New War, with the added ability to summon a 'Kaithe', a horse-like creature, and a guiding hand to reveal nearby objectives, as well as use one of six melee weapons. The player is granted the opportunity to play out the tale of one of the five royal courtiers of the kingdom of Duviri, and complete six main objectives as the courtier slowly loses control over their respective emotion. After completing these, the courtier and their uncontrolled emotions turn into a dragon, which the player must defeat and pacify. The main gamemode, 'The Duviri Experience', allows the player to play through the tale as well as complete side-objectives, while the gamemode 'The Lone Story' excludes these side-objectives, allowing the player to focus on the story. The third gamemode, 'The Circuit', has the player fight as the Warframe against waves of enemies in the Undercroft, in exchange for unique rewards such as Warframe parts or 'Incarnon' upgrades for existing weapons. Duviri also features lost fragments telling of Duviri's background lore, as well as a vendor, Acrithis, who sells Origin System resources and upgrades, decorations, and more in exchange for resources found throughout the landscape. Duviri's appearance, behavior, and its featured tale and courtier cycles every two hours in the order of Joy, Anger, Envy, Sorrow, and Fear.\n\nWhispers in the Walls\nThe Whispers in the walls expansion was released on December 12, 2023. It explores the escalating threat of a mysterious cosmic entity called the Man in the Wall, and the methods Orokin scientist Albrecht Entrati has taken in order to subdue it. The update added a new enemy faction to the game, The Murmur, along with a boss within that faction named 'The Fragmented One'. The update also added multiple new gamemodes, 'Alchemy', where players use pickups from defeated enemies to fuel a crucible and 'Netracells', a gamemode with much higher enemy levels where players are tasked with killing enemies within a small zone. These mission types both reward players with many new modifications for their melee weapons. With the update's release, cross-platform save began to rollout to different groups of players in waves, with it being fully available to all players as of January 17, 2024.\n\nThe Lotus Eaters\nThe Lotus Eaters expansion was released in August, 2024, and is primarily a prologue to 1999.\n\nKoumei & The Five Fates\nKoumei & The Five Fates is an update released on October 2nd, 2024 that has a Japanese theme and includes a new Warframe, and quality of life improvements.\n\n1999\nThe 1999 expansion, also titled 'Warframe: 1999', was released on December 13, 2024. It is centered around an alternate history 1999 and the Protoframes - individuals that are precursors to certain present-day Warframes. Players initially take the role of Arthur Nightingale, the Protoframe of Excalibur, during the events of New Year's Eve 1999 in Höllvania, a city under threat of a virus outbreak and paramilitary occupation. Players then take control of the Drifter as they team up with The Hex, a group of Protoframes led by Arthur, as they attempt to locate Albrecht Entrati in Höllvania.\n\nReception\nOn release, Warframe received \"mixed or average reviews\" on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, while the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 versions received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameZone's Mike Splechta said of the PlayStation 4 version, \"If you already enjoy games like Monster Hunter which require you to farm for items to craft better ones, Warframe follows that very same formula, except with much more satisfying and faster-paced combat.\" However, as of 2018 PC Gamer said that \"Warframe's growth doesn't resemble a well-tended plant—it's more like a mutant science experiment. Game systems are haphazardly stitched onto one other in ways that are sometimes incoherent, but oddly charming all the same.\"\nThe game is one of the most-played games available on Steam. Digital Extremes attributes the success of the title by being a F2P game. Digital Extremes describes the game as a \"rogue success\", as the game can secure and sustain a large number of players without gaining significant attention from other people. More than 26 million players had played the game since launch by April 2016, and by March 2018, five years from its open beta, had reached 38 million players. The game had nearly 50 million players by the time of its sixth anniversary. In July 2016, Digital Extremes launched its first Warframe-dedicated convention, \"TennoCon\", in London, Ontario, drawing 1000 players, where they announced news of upcoming features and updates to the game. Digital Extremes have been running the event annually ever since.\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Ongoing Game\" at The Game Awards 2017, and won the People's Voice Award for \"Action\" at the 2018 Webby Awards. It was also nominated for the \"Still Playing Award\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and for \"Fan Favorite Shooter Game\" and \"Fan Favorite Fall Release\" with Fortuna at the Gamers' Choice Awards. At the 2019 Webby Awards, the game again won the Peoples Voice Awards for \"Action Game\" and \"Best Sound Design\". It was nominated for \"Best Game Expansion\" with Empyrean and for the \"Still Playing\" award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nWarframe wiki\nWarframe at MobyGames",

        "streamer": "SIMURGH",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simurgh",
        "content": "The simurgh (; Persian: سیمرغ; also spelled senmurv, simorgh, simorg, simurg, simoorg, simorq or simourv) is a benevolent bird in Persian mythology and literature. It bears some similarities with mythological birds from different origins, such as the phoenix (Persian: ققنوس quqnūs) and the humā (Persian: هما). The figure can be found in all periods of Iranian art and literature and is also evident in the iconography of Georgia, medieval Armenia, the Eastern Roman Empire, and other regions that were within the realm of Persian cultural influence.\n\nEtymology\nThe Persian word sīmurğ (سیمرغ) derives from Middle Persian sēnmurw and earlier sēnmuruγ, also attested in Pazend texts as sīna-mrū. The Middle Persian word comes from Avestan mərəγō Saēnō \"the bird Saēna\", originally a raptor, likely an eagle, falcon, or sparrowhawk, as can be deduced from the etymological cognate Sanskrit śyenaḥ (श्येनः) raptor, eagle and bird of prey, which also appears as a divine figure. Saēna is also a personal name. The word was lent to Armenian as siramarg (սիրամարգ) 'peacock'.\nOn the other hand, the phrase sī murğ (سی مرغ) means \"thirty birds\" in Persian; this has been used by Attar of Nishapur in his symbolic story of The Conference of the Birds, the frame story of which employs a play on the name.\n\nMythology\n.\n\nForm and function\nThe Simurgh is depicted in Iranian art as a winged creature in the shape of a bird, gigantic enough to carry off an elephant or a whale. It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion – sometimes, however, also with a human face. The Simurgh is inherently benevolent. Being part mammal, they suckle their young. The Simurgh has an enmity towards snakes, and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. Its feathers are said to be the colour of copper in some versions, and though it was originally described as being a dog-bird, later it was shown with either the head of a man or a dog.\n\"Si-\", the first element in the name, has been connected in folk etymology to Modern Persian si (\"thirty\"). Although this prefix is not historically related to the origin of the name simurgh, \"thirty\" has nonetheless been the basis for legends incorporating that number – for instance, that the simurgh was as large as thirty birds or had thirty colours (siræng). Other suggested etymologies include Pahlavi sin murgh (\"eagle bird\") and Avestan saeno merego (\"eagle\").\nIranian legends consider the bird so old that it had seen the destruction of the world three times over. The simurgh learned so much by living so long that it is thought to possess the knowledge of all the ages. In one legend, the simurgh was said to live 1,700 years before plunging itself into flames (much like the phoenix).\nThe simurgh was considered to purify the land and waters and hence bestow fertility. The creature represented the union between the Earth and the sky, serving as mediator and messenger between the two. The simurgh roosted in Gaokerena, the Hōm (Avestan: Haoma) Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world sea (Vourukasha). The plant is potent medicine and is called all-healing, and the seeds of all plants are deposited on it. When the simurgh took flight, the leaves of the tree of life shook, making all the seeds of every plant fall out. These seeds floated around the world on the winds of Vayu-Vata and the rains of Tishtrya, in cosmology taking root to become every type of plant that ever lived and curing all the illnesses of mankind.\nThe relationship between the simurgh and Hōm is extremely close. Like the simurgh, Hōm is represented as a bird, a messenger, and the essence of purity that can heal any illness or wound. Hōm – appointed as the first priest – is the essence of divinity, a property it shares with the simurgh. The Hōm is in addition the vehicle of farr(ah) (MP: khwarrah, Avestan: khvarenah, kavaēm kharēno) (\"divine glory\" or \"fortune\"). Farrah in turn represents the divine mandate that was the foundation of a king's authority.\nIt appears as a bird resting on the head or shoulder of would-be kings and clerics, indicating Ormuzd's acceptance of that individual as his divine representative on Earth. For the commoner, Bahram wraps fortune/glory \"around the house of the worshipper, for wealth in cattle, like the great bird Saena, and as the watery clouds cover the great mountains\" (Yasht 14.41, cf. the rains of Tishtrya above). Like the simurgh, farrah is also associated with the waters of Vourukasha (Yasht 19.51, 56–57). In Yašt 12.17 Simorgh's (Saēna's) tree stands in the middle of the sea Vourukaša, it has good and potent medicine and is called all-healing, and the seeds of all plants are deposited on it.\n\nIn the Shahnameh\nThe simurgh made its most famous appearance in Ferdowsi's epic Shahnameh (Book of Kings), where its involvement with Prince Zal is described. According to the Shahnameh, Zal, the son of Saam, was born albino. When Saam saw his albino son, he assumed that the child was the spawn of devils, and abandoned the infant on the mountain Alborz.\nThe child's cries were heard by the tender-hearted simurgh, who lived atop this peak, and she retrieved the child and raised him as her own. Zal was taught much wisdom from the loving simurgh, who has all knowledge, but the time came when he grew into a man and yearned to rejoin the world of men. Though the simurgh was terribly saddened, she gave him three golden feathers which he was to burn if he ever needed her assistance.\n\nUpon returning to his kingdom, Zal fell in love and married the beautiful Rudaba. When it came time for their son to be born, the labor was prolonged and terrible; Zal was certain that his wife would die in labour. Rudaba was near death when Zal decided to summon the simurgh. The simurgh appeared and instructed him upon how to perform a cesarean section thus saving Rudaba and the child, who became one of the greatest Persian heroes, Rostam.\nSimurgh also shows up in the story of the Seven Trials of Esfandiyar in the latter's 5th labor. After killing the wicked enchantress, Esfandiyar fights a simurgh, and despite the simurgh's many powers, Esfandiyar strikes it in the neck, decapitating it. The simurgh's offspring then rise to fight Esfandiyar, but they, too, are slain.\n\nIn Persian Sufi poetry\nIn classical and modern Persian literature the simorḡ is frequently mentioned, particularly as a metaphor for God in Sufi mysticism. In the 12th century Conference of the Birds, Iranian Sufi poet Farid ud-Din Attar wrote of a band of pilgrim birds in search of the simurgh. In the poem, the birds of the world gather to decide who is to be their king, as they have none. The hoopoe, the wisest of them all, suggests that they should find the legendary simorgh, a mythical Persian bird roughly equivalent to the western phoenix. The hoopoe leads the birds, each of whom represent a human fault which prevents man from attaining enlightenment. When the group of thirty birds finally reach the dwelling place of the simorgh, all they find is a lake in which they see their own reflection. This scene employs a pun on the Persian expression for \"thirty birds\" (si morgh).\nThe phrase also appears three times in Rumi's Masnavi, e.g. in Book VI, Story IX: \"The nest of the sī murğ is beyond Mount Qaf\" (as translated by E.H. Whinfield).\nThrough heavy Persian influence, the simurgh was introduced to the Arabic-speaking world, where the concept was conflated with other Arabic mythical birds such as the ghoghnus, a bird having some mythical relation with the date palm, and further developed as the rukh (the origin of the English word \"roc\").\nRepresentations of simurgh were adopted in early Umayyad art and coinage.\n\nIn Kurdish folklore\nSimurgh is shortened to \"sīmir\" in the Kurdish language. The scholar C. V. Trever quotes two Kurdish folktales about the bird. These versions go back to the common stock of Iranian simorḡ stories. In one of the folk tales, a hero rescues the simurgh's offspring by killing a snake that was crawling up the tree to feed upon them. As a reward, the simurgh gives him three of her feathers which the hero can use to call for her help by burning them. Later, the hero uses the feathers, and the simurgh carries him to a distant land. In the other tale, the simurgh carries the hero out of the netherworld; here the simurgh feeds its young with its teats, a trait which agrees with the description of the simurgh in the Middle Persian book of Zadspram. In another tale, simurgh feeds the hero on the journey while the hero feeds simurgh with pieces of sheep's fat.\n\nIn popular culture\nAmbrose Bierce's The Devil's Dictionary (1906) characterizes the Simurgh as \"omnipotent on condition that it do nothing\" and likens it to the role of the rabble in a republic.\nThe title of Salman Rushdie's first novel, Grimus (1975), is an anagram of Simurg.\nSimurgh is the name of a proxy tool introduced in 2009 that helps residents of Iran avoid government censorship of websites.\nThe Crystal Simorgh is an award given by Fajr International Film Festival.\nThe Simorgh is one of the creatures encountered by the protagonists in the 2006 movie Azur & Asmar: The Princes' Quest.\nThe Simurgh is the name of one of the Endbringers in the 2011 Worm (web serial).\nIn the Yugioh card game, Simorgh is the boss monster of its own archetype.\nA Simurgh card from a fictional collectible card game serves as a major plot device in the sci-fi novel Entanglement, by Gibson Monk.\nA simurgh appeared in chapter 49 of the manga Delicious in Dungeon as Laios contemplates various bird-like monsters. It is shown large enough to hold an elephant in its talons.\nThe Simurgh is featured in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, a 2024 video game in which it indirectly grants the player character various time-manipulation powers used to progress in the game.\nIn her poem \"Garden Simurgh\", Kathleen Raine describes how 'I hung out nuts for the blue-tits but the sparrows came, / All thirty of them / With a flurry of wings, / One mind in thirty vociferous selves...' eventually concluding that no 'wonder-bird' should be deemed 'more miraculous' than these 'two-a-farthing sparrows / Each feather bearing the carelessly-worn signature / Of the universe'.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAnqa, Arabian mythological bird identified with the Simurgh\nAnzû (older reading: Zû), Mesopotamian monster\nChamrosh, Persian mythological bird\nChimera, Greek mythological hybrid monster\nFenghuang, mythological bird of East Asia\nGaruda, Indian mythological bird\nGriffin or griffon, Greek lion-bird hybrid\nHuma bird, Iranian mythical bird\nHybrid creatures in mythology\nKonrul, Turkish mythological hybrid bird\nLamassu, Assyrian deity, bull/lion-eagle-human hybrid\nLuan, Chinese mythological bird related to the phoenix, whose name is often translated as \"simurgh\"\nNue, Japanese legendary creature\nOksoko, Slavic mythological double-headed eagle\nPamola, A Legendary bird-spirit in Abenaki Mythology\nPegasus, winged stallion in Greek mythology\nPixiu or Pi Yao, Chinese mythical creature\nRoc, Arab and Persian legendary bird, the opposite of Anqa\nShahbaz (bird), Persian mythological bird\nSimargl, a related being in Slavic mythology\nSphinx, Greek mythical creature with lion's body and human head\nTurul, Turkic and Hungarian mythological bird of prey and a national symbol of Hungarians\nZiz, giant griffin-like bird in Jewish mythology\nZhar Ptica, bird in Russian mythology parallel to the Phoenix\n\nNotes\nReferences\nGhahremani, Homa A.

        "content": "Carl Martin Erik Larsson (born 20 September 1996), better known as Rekkles (pronounced \"reckless\"), is a Swedish professional League of Legends player for Los Ratones team playing in the NLC league, owned and coached by British League content creator Caedrel. He has played for Fnatic, Alliance, G2 Esports, Karmine Corp and T1 Esports Academy.\nHe is the first player to have reached both 1,000 and 2,000 kills in the LEC and the European player with the most pentakills (10). He is considered the best AD Carry player in European history and one of the best in the world.\nOriginally from Älvängen, near Gothenburg, he became interested in video games after he injured his cruciate ligament playing football.\nHis esport career began in 2012, when he played for League of Legends teams Playing Ducks, PAH, Team BLACK (as a substitute) and SK Gaming. In November 2012, he joined Fnatic as their starting AD Carry. However, Rekkles was unable to participate in the 2013 EU LCS for Fnatic, due to being too young. Because of this, a secondary Fnatic squad, Fnatic.Beta, was created around him.  However, the team was disbanded after a few months. In May 2013, he started playing together with YoungBuck, Shook v2, cowTard, and Unlimited as PrideFC, and after the team got signed by Copenhagen Wolves, he agreed to continue playing with them as a stand-in. \nOn 22 November in 2013, Rekkles officially retook the starting AD Carry position in Fnatic from puszu, as he was now old enough to participate in the EU LCS.\nRekkles returned to Fnatic for the 2015 Summer EU LCS. They went undefeated all summer and won the playoffs in August, qualifying for the 2015 League of Legends World Championship. In the 2016 Spring EU LCS, they made it to the semifinals.\nHowever, on the 28th of April 2023, after two hard splits with Fnatic, Rekkles announced his decision to roleswap from AD Carry to Support.\nOn 11 December 2023, he officially became a player of the T1 Esports Academy team, which plays in the LCK Challengers League. This makes him the first high-profile player from a Western region to play in Korea. He also was a part of T1's 2024 World Championship winning team as a stand-in; he did not play any games during the event.\nOn 15 November 2024, Rekkles was announced to join Los Ratones, a professional team run by content creator and former caster Caedrel.\nRekkles has appeared in 8 international S-tier tournaments: 7 times at the World Championship (6 as a starter, 1 as a stand-in) and 1 time at MSI.\n\nProfessional career\nEarly career\nRekkles competitive career started at age 16 with the teams Playing Ducks and PAH. He was also as a substitute player for both Team BLACK and SK Gaming.\n\nFnatic\nHis performance allowed him in November 2012 to join Fnatic as their starting AD Carry. Because of age restrictions in the European version of the League Championship Series he was not yet allowed to play for Fnatic in the EU LCS. At first a new team with the name \"Fnatic.Beta\" was formed around him, but after a few month it was disbanded. Rekkles briefly left Fnatic then to play for various teams with the agreement to join again for the 2014 season, in which he would be eligible to play. On 22 November 2013, Rekkles officially retook the AD Carry position.\nDuring the 4th season, Rekkles and Fnatic participated in the IEM Season VIII - World Championship, and ended up second place after losing to KT Rolster Bullets during the Grand Finale.\nAt the beginning of 2014 season Spring Split, Rekkles played very well and received the MVP prize weekly. Fnatic had won each of their four superweek games, and this was mainly due to the great performance of Rekkles playing Jinx. They ended the Spring split in 2nd place, losing to SK Gaming, but secured themselves a spot in the Spring Playoffs. The whole team raised their game for the playoffs, and they emerged victorious after a win against Alliance in their semifinals matchup, and against SK Gaming in the Grand Final.\nFnatic endured a rocky start during the beginning of the Summer Split. They could not make it into the top 2 until Week 7 of the Split, while their main rivals Alliance were already at considerable distance ahead of them in the race for 1st place. Throughout the games, Rekkles managed to impress with his plays with Lucian and Vayne, picking up the Weekly MVP Award for Week 9.\n\nAlliance/Elements\nOn 24 November 2014, Rekkles joined Alliance as starting AD carry, after many rumours. His first event with Alliance was IEM San Jose. During the IEM, Fnatic ended up in the semifinals, however team lost their match against Cloud9 and placed third after playing against Team SoloMid. During the event, Rekkles was nominated for the MVP award along with PowerOfEvil, Vizicsacsi, Kikis, and Sneaky; however the final vote went to Sneaky.\nIn order to comply with new LCS regulations, Alliance would have to change their name for the upcoming season. On 8 January, it was announced that the team had rebranded as Elements. The Spring Split was not a success for the team as they finished 7th place after making a number of roster changes. Therefore, the team did not made it to the playoffs, however they did qualify for the Summer Split.\n\nReturn to Fnatic\nOn 14 May 2015, Rekkles rejoined Fnatic. He was a part of the Fnatic roster that managed to finish the regular season with an unbeaten 18–0 record and become the first team to achieve this in League Championship Series history. He won the EU LCS championship after beating Origen, 3–2.\nIn 2018, Rekkles won both the Spring and Summer Split EU LCS championships. In both splits, he secured a spot on the 1st All-Pro Team.\nHe was a part of the team's 2018 World Championship run, where they became the first Western team since Season 1 to advance to the finals.\n\nG2 Esports\nIn November 2020, Rekkles' contract in Fnatic had expired. He decided to move on from Fnatic to G2 Esports, where the spot for AD Carry was open after Perkz had left the team to play in the LCS.\nAt the beginning of the Spring Season of the League of Legends European Championship, a song dedicated to Rekkles titled Reckless with my heart was released by the LEC casters. The single is about Rekkles abandoning Fnatic, where he was a long time veteran, to join G2 Esports.\nAfter a poor 2021 season, G2 Esports' CEO Carlos \"ocelote\" Rodríguez placed Rekkles on the buyout market. His buyout price was listed at €1.5 million.\n\nKarmine Corp\nRekkles settled in the European regional league LFL with team Karmine Corp. While playing in the LFL in his first split he finished 3rd and won the EU Masters tournament. However, in the following split, Karmine Corp finished 6th in the LFL, unable to qualify for the EU Masters Summer tournament.\n\nFnatic\nAfter spending one year on the ERL scene with Karmine Corp, Rekkles returned to the LEC. On 15 December 2022, he officially signed with Fnatic, where he had previously played twice. During the Spring split, on 26 March 2023, Rekkles reached his 500th game in the LEC. After finishing 9th in the Winter Split and 8th in the Spring Split, Rekkles announces his decision to roleswap from AD Carry to Support. Following this roleswap, Fnatic benched Rekkles.\n\nT1 Esports Academy\nAfter less than 1 year in the LEC, he moved to T1 Esports Academy and became the first high profile player from the west to play in the Korean league. On 11 December 2023, T1 officially announced Esports Academy with Dal - Guwon - Poby - Smash - Rekkles, Cloud as substitutive support and GBM as head coach to play in the LCK Challengers League. Rekkles' debut match in the LCK CL broke the viewing record.\nRekkles was with T1 as an substitute at the 2024 League of Legends World Championship, which T1 won. However, he did not play any games during the tournament.\n\nLos Ratones\nOn 15 November 2024, League of Legends content creator Marc \"Caedrel\" Lamont, announced that he would start his own professional team to compete in an EMEA Regional League (ERL), known as Los Ratones. The roster was announced that day, consisting of Tim \"Nemesis\" Lipovšek, Simon \"Thebausffs\" Hofverberg, Veljko \"Velja\" Čamdžić, Juš \"Crownie\" Marušič and Rekkles, with Caedrel as head coach. Los Ratones was announced to join the NLC (the Northern League of Legends Championship) on 2 January 2025, as part of the ERL's expansion to 10 teams.\n\nSeasons overview\nOther titles\nDreamHack Winter 2012 (Fnatic)\nThor Open 2012 (Fnatic)\nDreamHack Summer 2013 (Copenhagen Wolves)\nGfinity London 2013 (Copenhagen Wolves)\n\nAwards and honors\nInternational\nOne-time World champion – 2024 (as a stand-in)\nTwo-time Rift Rivals champion – 2018, 2019\nLEC\nFour-time LEC champion – Spring 2014, Summer 2015, Spring 2018, Summer 2018\nFour-time LEC season MVP – Summer 2014, Summer 2017, Spring 2018, Spring 2021\nThree-time LEC Finals MVP – Summer 2015, Spring 2018, Summer 2018\nOne-time LEC Playoffs MVP – Spring 2014\nSix-time LEC First All-Pro Team – Summer 2015, Summer 2017, Spring 2018, Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Summer 2021\nOne-time LEC Second All-Pro Team – Spring 2017\nFour-time LEC Third All-Pro Team – Summer 2016, Spring 2019, Summer 2019, Summer 2020\nOther\nTwo-time DreamHack champion – Winter 2012, Summer 2013\nOne-time Thor Open champion – 2012\nOne-time Gfinity champion – London 2013\nOne-time EMEA Masters champion – Spring 2022\nOne-time NLC champion - Winter 2025\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nRekkles on Twitch\nRekkles on Twitter\nRekkles on Facebook\nAs of this edit, this article uses content from \"Rekkles\", which is licensed in a way that permits reuse under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, but not under the GFDL.

        "content": "FaZe Clan, or simply FaZe, is a professional esports and entertainment brand. Founded on May 30, 2010, as FaZe Sniping, the organization has professional players and content creators from around the world, across multiple games.\nIn October 2023, an agreement was announced for FaZe Clan's parent company FaZe Holdings to be acquired by GameSquare in an all stock deal. In May 2024, GameSquare announced the formation of a new company, FaZe Media, led by Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson. This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an esports company, and an internet media company.\n\nHistory\nFaZe Sniping made its debut on YouTube on May 30, 2010. Originally, the group were a Call of Duty clan founded by three players, Eric \"CLipZ\" Rivera, Jeff \"House Cat\" Emann (now known as \"Timid\") and Ben \"Resistance\" Christensen. The trio garnered a reputation for innovating trickshotting in the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Their YouTube content took off when Ted \"Fakie\" joined the clan. It was then when FaZe unveiled the most popular series on their channel, ILLCAMS. FaZe Clan's focus on trickshotting and a personality-driven approach to social media led to FaZe Clan becoming one of the first popular YouTube video game channels, compared to other Call of Duty channels which often focused solely on winning tournaments. In 2012, the channel had one million subscribers, and the clan began to branch out into esports competitions. Teams under the FaZe name began competing in competitions such as the Call of Duty Championship and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships, who were separate from the clan's YouTube content creators, splitting members of FaZe Clan into two mostly autonomous camps. Originally, FaZe Clan did not have a corporate structure, however the original CEO was Thomas \"Temperrr\" Oliveira, who had been a member of FaZe since he was 16 years old. Oliveira and COO Richard “Banks” Bengtson created the first FaZe shared home in 2014 in Plainview, New York, intended to facilitate lifestyle content alongside their gaming content.\nIn 2015, former social media platform Hubrick, run by Norwegian entrepreneur Sebastian Geurts, invested in FaZe Clan. Hubrick recruited former record executive Lee Trink to act as an advisor. In January 2016, FaZe Clan acquired European esports team G2 Esports's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive international lineup, who competed as FaZe Clan in the 2016 MLG Major Championship: Columbus, The team won second place in ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018, losing to US-based Cloud9. In 2017, Bengtson moved to Los Angeles, starting a new shared home with YouTubers called the Clout House. FaZe Clan were the runners up in ESL Pro League Season 6 in 2017, and second runners up of ESL Pro League Season 7 and ESL One Cologne 2018. FaZe Clan were the champions of ELeague CS:GO Premier in 2017, winning $500,000 of prize money.\nIn 2018, Greg Selkoe, founder of streetware web retailer Karmaloop, became the president of FaZe Clan, with Trink becoming the CEO. In late 2018, FaZe Clan opened its series A funding round. Throughout 2019, musicians Ray J, DJ Paul, Offset, Swae Lee, Yo Gotti, Pitbull, and Disco Fries, basketball players Meyers Leonard, Josh Hart, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, footballer Gregory van der Wiel, skateboarder Nyjah Huston, radio host Big Boy, music executives Sylvia Rhone, Troy Carter and Guy Oseary and actor Chris O'Donnell invested in FaZe Clan. In December 2019, FaZe closed its series A led by entrepreneur Jimmy Iovine and mobile e-commerce platform NTWRK.\nIn January 2020, FaZe Clan obtained a $22.7 million investment loan from a private lender. FaZe was advised on the transaction by Canaccord Genuity, a Canadian financial company. On June 18, 2020, FaZe Clan announced its co-ownership of CTRL, a food supplement company. In December 2020, FaZe Clan was worth $305 million. That same month the revenue of FaZe Clan was estimated $40 million. It also released the film Crimson under FaZe Studios in 2020, with Brian \"Rug\" Awadis in a leading role.\nOn June 10, 2021, FaZe Clan became the first esports team to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The same year, a merger was announced with special purpose acquisition investors B. Riley Principal to become a public company listed on NASDAQ, with an expected initial valuation of about $1 billion. As part of this merge, FaZe would receive $291 million from B. Riley, and would be renamed to Faze Holdings Inc. and refocus itself as a brand for \"the voice of youth culture\". The merger was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the company went public on July 20, 2022, however with a lower than announced valuation of $725 million. Also in 2021, FaZe Clan member Frazier Khattrri (FaZe Kay) would become one of the lead promoters of Save the Kids token, a pump and dump cryptocurrency which was additionally promoted by FaZe members Jarvis, Teeqo and Nikan. Upon the token's launch and revelation to the public that it was a pump and dump, FaZe removed Kay and suspended Jarvis, Teeqo, and Nikan for their involvement.\nIn July 2022, FaZe Clan became a publicly traded company. The company had only received a portion of the money they were promised by private investors ahead of their merge with B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Group. On January 20, 2023, the price of their stock fell below one dollar for the first time, which put them at risk of being delisted. According to Nasdaq policy, if a company's stock is under one dollar for more than a month, the company will receive a deficiency notice, in which they have 180 days for the stock to be one dollar or more for ten consecutive business days. As of February 15, 2023, the stock was at $0.76. In March 2023, it was reported that the company received a notice of delisting, which gave them 180 days to raise the stock price above one dollar. Trink, the CEO, had expressed concerns and had stated that the company is working towards a solution to their problem. As of September 2022, it was reported that the organization had enough money to last them until November 2023.\nIn February 2023, FaZe Clan laid off 20% of its staff. Trink attributed it to uncertainty in the economy stated that the company would focus on financial discipline. He reported that the revenue growth for 2022 was a 25% increase from 2021. However, FaZe Clan reported losses of approximately $14 million in the first two quarters of 2023, with slightly decreased revenues. In April 2023, Snoop Dogg departed from FaZe Clan's board, and on September 11, 2023, FaZe Clan announced the immediate termination of Trink from his position as CEO. The company appointed Christoph Pachler, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of FaZe Clan, as the interim CEO.\nIn October 2023, it was announced that FaZe Clan had been acquired by GameSquare Holdings Inc., and subsequently added to the GameSquare esports portfolio. With this acquisition, Bengtson, Oliveira, and Yousef Abdelfattah (FaZe Apex) were appointed as CEO, president, and COO respectively.\nOn April 27, 2024, Bengtson kicked out members of FaZe Clan, reducing the content creator roster to fourteen members in an effort to \"reboot\" the organization.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Esports World Cup Foundation, funded by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and organizers of the Esports World Cup tournament series, announced the 30 organizations (known in the ESWC as Clubs) who would make up the Club Support Program, with FaZe Clan being one of them. This program gives teams a one-time six-figure stipend if an organization is willing to enter new esports as well as additional funding each year if they drive viewership and fan engagement to the Esports World Cup.\nOn May 14, 2024, GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna announced the formation of FaZe Media, led by Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson as CEO. This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an esports company, and an internet media company. FaZe Media received $11 million in investment from Matt Kalish, the president and co-founder of DraftKings, resulting in Kalish owning 49% of FaZe Media during its foundation.  FaZe Media will focus on developing a creator-led internet media company with GameSquare continuing to own 100% of the esports competition assets under FaZe Esports. On June 19, 2024, Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson acquired 25.5% in FaZe Media from GameSquare.\nIn December 2024, FaZe won Best Content Organization at The Streamer Awards, where it was also nominated for Best Marathon Stream. At the time, its new streamer roster included JasonTheWeen, Adapt, PlaqueBoyMax, Banks, Silky, Lacy, and StableRonaldo.\n\nCurrent divisions\nCall of Duty\nFaZe France\nOn September 19, 2013, FaZe eSniping, their competitive Call of Duty sniping division, was announced with the joining of Raphael \"Zydar\" Zydar, Elliot \"Hyspe\" and Kevin \"RanbOw\", led by Anil \"WaRTeK\" Brancaleoni. On April 3, 2014, FaZe Clan announced the rebranding of FaZe eSniping to FaZe France. RanbOw left the team after one and a half years, with Anthony \"Toto\" replacing him. On May 26, 2015, the players and staff of FaZe France stated they weren't satisfied with FaZe's plans and left to create their own organization.\n\nAtlanta FaZe\nOn May 2, 2019, Activision Blizzard announced that Atlanta Esports Ventures had purchased one of the first five franchise slots for the Call of Duty League. According to ESPN, the publisher was looking to sell slots for approximately $25 million per team. \"We have the opportunity to—once again—play a pivotal role in Atlanta's diverse esports community by bringing the future of Call of Duty esports to the city,\" said Hamilton in a release at the time.

Kolcheff also had a falling out with 100 Thieves co-owner and founder Matthew \"Nadeshot\" Haag and the two have not spoken since Kolcheff left the organization. He joined FaZe Clan later that month.\nDespite offers from rival streaming services, Kolcheff said he would stay with Twitch. Kolcheff has garnered upwards of 70,000 viewers on Twitch. He is estimated to have earned $6 million in 2019 and was the 10th highest earning gamer that year.\nIn May 2023, a skin based on Kolcheff was announced for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. The skin was removed from the game a month later due to a tweet he made in reaction to a fight that broke out in California as a result of schools including content about the LGBT community in their curriculum. The tweet stated: \"They should leave little children alone. That's the real issue\". In June 2024, he faced backlash for claiming there is no such thing as transgender people. Nickmercs was then later suspended from Twitch. In a Twitter post addressing his suspension, Nickmercs said it was for using the slur \"tranny\" and said that in the future he would use the phrase \"mental health disorder\" against transgender people.\nIn January 2025, Kolcheff announced that he would be leaving FaZe Clan, stating that he had no issues with the organization and it was \"just time to move forward\".\n\nPersonal life\nKolcheff is married and has one son. Kolcheff endorsed Donald Trump during the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNickmercs on Twitch\nNickmercs at IMDb",

        "streamer": "VINESAUCE",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesauce",
        "content": "Vinesauce is a collective of online content creators founded in 2010. The group primarily focuses on video game livestreaming and commentary videos. The group is most notable for content in which video games are corrupted to cause glitches, as well as content covering obscure video games and other media. The popularity of this content has earned media coverage from major video game outlets such as Kotaku, VG247, PC Gamer and Nintendo Life.\n\nHistory\nIn 2010, content creator Vinny formed Vinesauce as a streaming community and YouTube channel. Inspired by both the nascent medium of streaming and a dream he had where he streamed the SNES video game Chrono Trigger, Vinny created an account on Livestream to stream the game, eventually learning aspects of streaming over time. Adopting the alias \"Vinny Vinesauce\" as his online pseudonym, Vinny later founded the Vinesauce website and recruited other streamers and content creators as members of the community.  As the years went by, the group has become independent as most of the members focus more on their individual content.\n\nInternet content\nVinesauce's content primarily focuses on hacks and mods of various retro games such as Super Mario 64 and its Chaos mod, The Legend of Zelda, Half-Life, Pokémon and Metal Gear Solid. Their content on retro games, in which they employ ROM corruptions and code manipulation to produce random glitches and effects, have been described as creepy and frightening from various media outlets. Vinesauce's process for game corruptions involves the use of a \"corruptor\", a program which arbitrarily rearranges a video game's machine code in order to recontextualize the game with new effects. Several of these effects range from humorous in nature to surprising and ghastly, with some corruptions offering new challenges to older games. Notable corruptors they've used include the \"Vinesauce ROM Corruptor\" and the \"Real Time Corruptor\" (RTC). Maxwell McGee of GamesRadar detailed the process of Vinesauce's corruption videos, stating that \"using the Vinesauce corruptor is like tuning a guitar, only instead of making something sound good you want it to sound as horrific as possible without completely falling apart.\" The group has also played various other video games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Fallout 4 and Super Mario Maker.\n\nActive Worlds\nIn 2016, Vinesauce received mainstream attention for their livestream of the 1995 virtual world game Active Worlds. Taking place in March 2016, the stream involved Vinny venturing in the virtual world until encountering a user named \"Hitomi Fujiko\", a player who appeared to exhibit non-player character traits. Vinny had initially assumed Fujiko was a character intended to guide players through the virtual world, but after various interactions with Fujiko, he slowly realized the character had evinced human-like traits. Vinny and Fujiko's interaction escalated with a conversation where Fujiko knew Vinny's name despite him registering his account as Vinesauce; shortly after, Fujiko left the server. 6,000 people watched the stream unfold with many of them attempting to register accounts in order to join Vinny's session, leading to an overload of the game's servers. The stream had led Vinesauce's fan base to uncover clues about the mystery surrounding Fujiko's actions, with Alex Avard of GamesRadar asserting that \"the events that followed were mythologized into one of the internet's best creepypasta stories.\" In 2018, author Andrew Reinhard cited the Active Worlds videos as an example of archaeogaming in the book Archaeogaming: An Introduction to Archaeology in and of Video Games.\n\nFake farm game\nIn 2021, several of Vinesauce's videos were cited in a mystery about a farming game that never existed. The mystery came into existence when a Reddit user named \"Sparta123\" wrote a thread on r/tipofmyjoystick describing a farming game akin to Harvest Moon that they tried to recall, with the premise involving a man who manslaughters his wife and tries to hide the body while working as a farmer. Sparta123's post led the game rumor to spread to various social media communities, with users attempting to investigate the existence of the farming game. In a video essay, YouTuber Justin Whang revealed that the premise of the game originated from Vinesauce member Vargskelethor Joel, citing a Reddit post from user \"PM_MeYourEars\" and a Discord post from \"AqueousSnake\" that identified an animated clip from one of Joel's streams. Sparta123 later confirmed that Vinesauce Joel's video was \"likely the source of the game,\" and Joel also apologized in a Twitch stream.\n\nOther ventures\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2014, Vinesauce created the Vinesauce is HOPE charity drive, a variety gaming stream where proceeds go to the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF); former Vinesauce member Hootey is credited with the idea for the event. In 2017 the Vinesauce is HOPE stream raised over $137,000 and in 2019 they raised over $218,000.\n\nRed Vox\nRed Vox is a rock band formed by Vinny and drummer Mike (Jabroni Mike) in 2015. Their music is primarily alternative rock with influences from psychedelic rock. Vinny has stated that rock bands such as Radiohead, Nirvana, Pink Floyd and Tame Impala were inspirations for the group's music. Their second album Another Light was released in 2017 and peaked at #13 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. They have released 6 albums and 2 EPs in total. In 2024, Mike left the band due to health problems.\n\nOther work\nIn 2014, Vinesauce interviewed video game developer Edmund McMillen to discuss secrets surrounding his game The Binding of Isaac. In 2020, Vinny appeared in an episode of the Boundary Break web series focused on the out-of-bounds content of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. In 2022, Vinesauce interviewed the actor Jack Mulcahy for starring in Creating Rem Lezar and discussed topics relating to insight on actors and film production. They also discussed the emotional aspects of the film and how Rem Lezar was specifically designed.\n\nImpact\nVinesauce's videos have been credited for popularizing Internet memes, such as The Daily Dot citing Vinesauce member Joel's Rollercoaster Tycoon videos as bringing various memes to a wider audience. Vinny's level creations on Super Mario Maker have also inspired similar creepypasta-based levels in the game. In a November 2024 corruption stream, Vinny compared the music and gameplay of Piglet's Big Game to the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises, contributing to the game becoming a viral phenomenon online.\nTechRadar cited Vinesauce as one of the 10 best YouTube channels playing games in a 2016 listicle, noting Vinny's Active Worlds videos and the channel's focus on esoteric games and mods. In 2021, Vinesauce was cited as an example of a \"comfort creator\" in an article from The New York Times.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Washington-based provider Wave Broadband had its EAS system hijacked, causing approximately 3,000 customers in Jefferson County to receive multiple false messages, including one telling viewers to subscribe to Vinesauce on Twitch. This was unaffiliated with Vinesauce, and neither Vinny nor any of the affiliated members appear to have commented on it.\nOn September 30, 2022, Vinny was invited by CNN to speak about his experience with the musical-comedy game Trombone Champ. In November 2022, he was again invited by CNN to speak about his experience with the video game Placid Plastic Duck Simulator with Rick Damigella.\n\nSee also\nList of YouTubers\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Yiliang \"Peter\" Peng (Chinese: 彭亦亮; pinyin: Péng Yìliàng), better known as Doublelift, is an American content creator, streamer, and semi-professional and former-professional League of Legends player. He previously played for Counter Logic Gaming, Team Liquid, Team SoloMid, and 100 Thieves, and currently plays for his own personal team, Near Airport. Peng is considered as one of the greatest North American League of Legends Championship Series player of all time. He is known for being a fierce competitor and trash-talking his opponents. One of his most famous statements came in 2013 at the League of Legends All-Star tournament when he claimed that, \"Everyone else is trash.\"\n\nCareer\nPeng comes from California, and started playing console games before jumping to PC titles such as DotA, World of Warcraft, and Heroes of Newerth, eventually moving to League of Legends. In an interview with Machinima in 2013, Peng said his relationship with his parents was strained, because of his dream of being a professional esports player. \"I would always struggle with my parents... we would just argue over everything, especially games. When I wanted to play they thought it was just a complete waste of time. It got worse and worse over the years.\" Peng first entered professional League of Legends when he gained the attention of George \"HotshotGG\" Georgallidis, founder of Counter Logic Gaming (CLG), who recruited him as a substitute Support player. Shortly after, Peng left CLG to become the starting Support for Epik Gamer. He later joined UnRestricted as the starting AD Carry, and the team was acquired by Team Curse later that year.\nPeng's first major tournament was DreamHack Summer 2011, also known as the Riot Season 1 Championship. Hosted in Sweden, he needed his parents' permission to go, but at the time his beginning esports career was a secret to his parents. \"They wouldn't let me go... They were like 'You're going to die if you go to Sweden for Dreamhack'. \" He was ultimately allowed to go after Doublelift's older brother helped convince their parents.\nPeng was timid and socially awkward around his teammates. \"I was really awkward and really introverted at the time. I was just that typical Asian guy who does nothing but play games. When I finally met my team I was like 'hi' and that was like the only thing I said. I said nothing after that. I was just a presence with them but I didn't interact with them very much.\" In a Reddit AMA, Peng said he owed it to Epik Gamer for giving him the opportunity to begin his career. \"Without Epik Gamer, I would have never made it into the pro scene most likely.\"\nWhen Peng returned home, he said his parents were not proud of his accomplishment at Dreamhack. \"They wanted me to go to college.\" Tensions grew between him and his parents over his choice of career, until in 2011 his parents told him to leave the house. He did, taking his prize money from Dreamhack and his computer. Peng wrote about the event on Reddit in a thread titled \"Hi I'm Doublelift, formerly of team [Epik Gamer], and today I became homeless.\" With no college degree or family to return to, he decided to go all-in on his professional gaming career. Peng began earning money for writing educational League of Legends content for Team Curse. \"I pretty much made half the guides for that site... I was just super happy and I could finally pay rent that month.\"\n\nCounter Logic Gaming (2012–2015)\nCLG prime would attend the 2012 MLG Fall Championship in Dallas on November 2 through 4th. In the first round they faced the Korean powerhouse NaJin Sword, where they were routed in two lopsided matches. Falling to the losers bracket, CLG Prime would sweep Curse Gaming in round one, and then pick up a close 2–1 series against another NA team Dignitas. They faced their sister team CLG EU in Round 3 and lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament. CLG Prime finished in 4th with $2,500 in winnings.\nOn February 27, 2013, CLG participated in the Riot Season 3 North American League Championship Series Spring Split.\nIn 2014, Peng and CLG finished third and fifth, respectively in the spring and summer playoffs, and did not qualify for international events.\nCLG and Peng were fined on January 6, 2015, after being found guilty of poaching ZionSpartan. CLG was fined $2,000 while Peng was fined $2,500. Furthermore, CLG was restricted from fielding ZionSpartan as a player or coach for the first week of the 2015 LCS Spring Split.\nFor the first eight weeks of the spring split, CLG was never lower in the standings than tied for second place. In the end, they lost a second-place tiebreaker to Cloud9 and so ended up in third place in the regular season. Ultimately, CLG lost to Team Liquid in the quarterfinals and ended the split tied for fifth place with Gravity Gaming.\nPeng was benched during the Summer LCS due to an injury incurred from playing basketball.\n\nIn August Peng helped CLG win their first-ever LCS Split playoff title. The victory also qualified them for the 2015 League of Legends World Championship. At Worlds CLG failed to make the bracket and finished 12/13th. On October 31, CLG informed Peng that they were not going to re-sign him.\n\nTeam SoloMid (2016)\nAfter CLG released a statement, Team SoloMid announced that Peng would be joining, replacing long tenured AD Carry WildTurtle. On his new team, Peng reached the finals of the spring split, and faced off against his old team, Counter Logic Gaming. TSM fell 3–2 to CLG, and took a second-place finish, missing out on the Mid-Season Invitational. In summer, Team SoloMid added a new support to pair with Peng in the botlane, picking up Vincent \"Biofrost\" Wang. The team saw significant improvement in the summer split, improving their previous 9–9 record to a 17–1 standing at the end of the regular season, and earned a bye into playoffs. Peng also earned First Team All–Pro honors for his performance. Peng once again made it to the finals, and this time won, defeating Cloud9 3–1, to give Peng his second title.\nBefore the start of the 2017 season, Team SoloMid announced that Peng would be taking a hiatus from professional League of Legends during the spring split, saying \"it's time for a small break.\" While he would remain contracted to the team, he would be streaming full-time until his return to professional play in the summer when, according to Team SoloMid owner Andy Dinh, he would have to compete with his replacement to return to the starting roster. In the past, Peng has spoken out about the never-ending competitive schedule for professional League of Legends. After representing North America in the All-Star 2013 in Shanghai, Peng said in a Reddit AMA \"I'm just tired of playing all day every day, and I want a goddamn break but it's not possible to get one.\" In a Reddit AMA in 2014, Peng said \"Most people who look at pros think that we live the dream life when in reality you either practice 16 hours a day or lose and end up frustrated. Sometimes you practice 16 hours a day and still end up losing.\" One month later, Team SoloMid announced that WildTurtle would be Peng's replacement for the 2017 spring split. In an interview, teammate Bjergsen agreed with Dinh's initial announcement that Peng would need to compete with his replacement, saying \"I want WildTurtle to succeed and I wasn't just sitting around waiting for Peter because I wanted someone who was committed, and like I said I was disappointed and I felt he wasn't very committed. I didn't feel like he should just have the luxury of going out and making a lot of money [streaming] and returning to the team... No matter how good of a friend they are to me, if someone decides he's just going to take six months off and he thinks he's can just reenter the team, that's just not okay with me because I think everyone has to earn their spot.\"\n\nTeam Liquid and brief return to TSM (2017–2020)\nMore than halfway through the spring season and threatened by relegation, Team Liquid announced that Peng would temporarily be joining the team and would be released back to Team SoloMid at the end of the spring split, sparking controversy due to concerns of a conflict of interest when Peng inevitably competed against Team SoloMid while signed to Team Liquid. Team Liquid owner Steve Arhancet responded that Riot Games approved the trade after the team demonstrated that no other player in that role would be suitable for the team.\nBefore the start of the 2018 NA LCS season, Team SoloMid announced they would be parting ways with Peng, citing a desire for a stronger shot-caller in the bottom lane. On the same day, Team Liquid announced Peng would be returning along with his ex-Counter Logic Gaming teammates Xmithie and Pobelter. The team finished 4th place in the Spring Split regular season, securing a spot in the playoffs with a 12–8 record behind his former team TSM. Team Liquid defeated Cloud9 3–0 in the quarterfinals and Echo Fox 3–1 in the semifinals to make it to the Team Liquid's first ever final.\nA week before the final, Peng learned that his mother Wei Ping Shen was killed and his father Guojon Peng seriously injured after his older brother Yihong Peng allegedly stabbed them in their family home in San Juan Capistrano California. Peng posted on Twitlonger \"I'm still processing this news and joining up with my dad and little brother to make sure they're ok and the proper arrangements are being made. I'll likely be quiet on social media while I work through this. I hope you all understand and support me as you always have in the past.\" In an interview with Machinima in 2013, Peng had said his older brother was the biggest influence on his life and career, and that he had regrets over his falling out with his parents and wished to make amends in the future, but with his busy career \"right now I can't do that, I'm too busy.\" Despite the pressure faced during this event, Steve Arhancet, owner and co-CEO of Team Liquid, announced that Doublelift would not be taking time off and was determined to play in the final as planned. In the final, Team Liquid convincingly defeated 100 Thieves 3–0 and won its first league championship.\nIn the summer split of 2018, Doublelift and Team Liquid picked up where they left off in spring. A tightly contested regular season saw Team Liquid come out with the number one seed by only a single game over Cloud9, qualifying them for a bye in the first round and a guaranteed spot in the semi-finals. Matched up against 100 Thieves, Doublelift and Team liquid cruised to a 3–1 series victory to move on to a spot in the finals against Cloud9. On the eve of the NA LCS finals, Doublelift was awarded a long-awaited NA LCS MVP for the summer split. This was his first MVP award. Team Liquid easily defeated Cloud9 3–0 in the finals to capture back to back North American LCS titles and looked towards a strong showing at Worlds 2018. However, they were eliminated in the group stage by KT Rolster and Edward Gaming.\nAfter their group stage exit at Worlds 2018, Team Liquid announced the signings of Jensen and former world champion CoreJJ to the mid lane and support positions respectively. With their newly revamped roster, Team Liquid finished 14–4 on the 2019 Spring Split advancing to the Spring finals to face Doublelift's former team TSM. Team Liquid dropped the first two games of the series, but won the final three games to reverse sweep TSM in the best of 5 series, thus earning Doublelift his 6th championship and 3rd straight title.\nDespite coming off of a strong performance in the Spring playoffs, Team Liquid struggled initially in the group stage of MSI 2019, but with a strong finish to the group stage they secured the final spot in the knock–out stage. In the semifinals, the 4th seeded Team Liquid upset the defending world champions, Invictus Gaming, 3–1, and advanced to the finals, where they faced G2 Esports, and were ultimately defeated in a 3–0 sweep.\nAfter MSI, Liquid started out the 2019 LCS Summer Split 2–2, tying them for 4th place. However, by the end of the split, they had once again accrued a 14–4 record, finishing first. In the summer playoffs, Team Liquid beat Clutch Gaming 3–2, and secured a spot at the 2019 League of Legends World Championship. They advanced to the summer finals where they met the second seeded Cloud9. TL won the first game of the series, then dropped games 2 and 3, before winning the final two games to secure their 4th straight LCS trophy. This was Doublelift his 7th championship overall, and passing Xmithie to become the player with the most Championship titles in LCS history. At Worlds, Team Liquid were drawn into Group D, alongside DAMWON Gaming, Invictus Gaming, and ahq e-Sports Club. They went 3–3, placing third in their group, and were eliminated from the tournament.\nWith their premature exit from Worlds, Team Liquid parted ways with their jungler, Xmithie, and signed former Fnatic Jungler, Broxah. Prior to the start of the spring 2020 split, Broxah had visa issues preventing him from joining them for the start of the spring season, and Team Liquid performed very poorly. Midway through the split, Doublelift was benched in favor of Team Liquid Academy ADC Tactical. According to Doublelift, this decision stemmed from his apparent lack of motivation to begin the 2020 spring split. Doublelift publicly apologized to his teammates for his attitude, and promised to work harder to return to the LCS stage. Doublelift returned to the starting lineup the following week, but ultimately Liquid finished the split in 9th place and did not make 2020 Spring Playoffs. Doublelift and Team Liquid's failure to qualify for playoffs marked the first time in LCS history that the reigning champion failed to qualify for the following split's playoffs.\n\nReturn to TSM (2020)\nWith a disappointing finish to Spring 2020, Team Liquid traded Doublelift to Team SoloMid for the 2020 Summer Split.\nWith his new team, Peng and TSM had a shaky start to the first half of the split, with a record of 6–3. Although they were third in LCS, critics deemed their wins unconvincing and some considered their record as not properly reflective of their actual skill level. In the middle of the split, Biofrost was replaced by TSM Academy support Treatz, with the team citing better communication and playmaking as the deciding factors.  TSM finished the regular split in 4th place with a 12–6 record and qualified for playoffs. In playoffs, TSM faced the fifth-seeded Golden Guardians in the upper bracket of the double-elimination tournament. Although it was projected to be a close series, Golden Guardians unexpectedly swept TSM 3–0 with the TSM bot lane being perceived as the weak link in the loss. After the first-round defeat, the team subbed Biofrost back in place of Treatz. The move was in part cited to the existing synergy between Doublelift and Biofrost, especially for laning phase. TSM would drop to the bottom half of the elimination bracket to face the 8th seed, Team Dignitas. TSM swept Dignitas in a convincing fashion, as expected. With the Golden Guardians' loss to Team Liquid, TSM had to face them once again in the 2nd round of the lower bracket. Golden Guardians took the first two games of the series, but behind outstanding performances from Bjergsen, Spica, and Brokenblade, TSM managed to come back and reverse sweep the series. In the next round, TSM faced Cloud9 in order to determine the final seed for the 2020 World Championships. TSM won the series against Cloud9 3–1 and qualified for Worlds. With Team Liquid losing to FlyQuest in the upper bracket, Doublelift faced his old team in order to move on to the summer split finals. TSM defeated Team Liquid 3–2 after a grueling five-game series. TSM faced FlyQuest in the finals, with TSM once again winning 3–2 after a tough five-game series. This win marked Doublelift's 8th NA LCS title.\nSuccessfully completing their miraculous lower bracket run, Doublelift and TSM headed to Shanghai for the 2020 World Championships as the NA 1st seed. During the tournament, TSM was placed into Group C along with the LCK 3rd seed Gen.G, the LEC 2nd seed FNC, and the LPL 4th seed LGD. Doublelift was once again unable to advance past the group stage, after TSM went 0–6 in the group stage.\nIn November 2020, Doublelift announced on his Twitter account that he was retiring from professional League of Legends, thus concluding a storied career which spanned nearly a decade.\nOn March 11, 2021, TSM announced on their Twitter that Peng was returning to the organization as a full-time content creator and streamer. Several months after his retirement, Peng revealed a significant reason he walked away from the pro scene was due to discontent with Team SoloMid, even going so far as to say \"I fucking hate TSM\" as well as accusing the owner, Reginald, of abuse, and left the organization entirely in November.\n\n100 Thieves (2023)\nIn December 2022, Doublelift announced his return to professional play, signing a contract with 100 Thieves for the 2023 season. In December 2023, Doublelift announced that he would be retiring for a second time.\n\nNear Airport (2025–present)\nIn January 2025, Doublelift announced that he would return to competitive League of Legends, this time under his own team later known as \"Near Airport\" (a reference to North America's history of lackluster performances in international competitions), for the North American Challengers League qualifiers. The team proceeded to qualify for Split 1 of NACL without droping a game. Near Airport has been compared to Los Ratones, a team founded by British streamer and former player Caedrel, for their practice of live-streaming scrimmages as well as their own games.\n\nPersonal life\nPeng was born on July 19, 1993, and grew up in Mission Viejo, California. He has a younger and an older brother. In April 2018, his older brother killed their mother and injured their father after an altercation outside of their family's home.\nPeng is close friends with esports journalist Travis Gafford. In an interview with Team Dignitas, Gafford said they first met when Peng posted on Reddit that he was homeless and Gafford offered for him to live on his couch until he had money to pay rent. Peng said \"Travis really helped me grow up as a person because when I'm playing games and focusing on my job you don't have basic social skills or an understanding of the world. When I go outside I'm like 'how much money am I supposed to spend on food? How do I do my taxes? How do I get a bank account?' I didn't have a credit card, all I had was my wallet with cash and a PayPal account. He helped me set up a bank account, he helped me set up my life.\"\n\nSeasons overview\nAwards and nominations\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nTwitter account\n\nAs of this edit, this article uses content from \"Doublelift\", which is licensed in a way that permits reuse under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, but not under the GFDL.

        "content": "Annoyance is an unpleasant mental state that is characterized by irritation and distraction from one's conscious thinking. It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger. The property of being easily annoyed is called irritability.\n\nPsychology\nVarious reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly.  Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure.  One can often encounter annoyance factors in media, including popular music, memes, commercials, and advertising jingles, which by their nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.\nA study published in the International Journal of Conflict Management found that one's response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved. It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one's self, for the annoyance as it escalated.\nPsychological warfare can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) played music \"specifically selected for its irritation ability\" on loudspeakers outside the Branch Davidian church in Waco, Texas in an attempt to bring about the surrender of David Koresh and his followers.\n\nEnglish law\nIn the sense of \"nuisance\", the noun \"annoyance\" is found in the English \"Jury of Annoyance\" appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the highways.\n\nSee also\n\nAgitation\nDistraction\nFrustration\nPet peeve\nSocial alienation\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Octavian Morosan (born June 30, 1987) better known by his online username Kripparrian, is a Romanian-Canadian Twitch streamer, YouTuber and video game personality. He is known for his achievements on Diablo III, World of Warcraft, and Hearthstone, as well as winning the \"Favorite Hearthstone Stream\" and Most \"Engaged\" Viewers categories, and coming second in the \"Highest Stream View Average\" category at the Blizzard Stream Awards in 2014. In June 2017 he achieved over one million followers on Twitch and as of October 2024, he has over 1.5 million followers.\n\nAchievements\nWorld of Warcraft\nKripparrian was a World of Warcraft player before beginning his streaming career, recognized for being the first person to complete the Ironman Challenge, being in a leading US raiding guild, Exodus, as well as being a competitor of top Hunter DPS parses during that time. In mid-2010, Kripparrian had the highest damage per second benchmarks for the Hunter class in the game.\n\nDiablo III\nKripparrian completed the Diablo III video game at \"Inferno\" difficulty (the highest in the game at that time) with his friend Krippi, just over a month after it was launched. The achievement was done before patch 1.0.3, which made the game easier, and both players used \"Hardcore\" characters in the feat, which are lost forever when the characters are killed in the game.\n\nHearthstone\nKripparrian is the second most popular Hearthstone streamer of all time. He competed in the Innkeeper's Invitational Hearthstone tournament at BlizzCon 2013. He has achieved \"Legend rank\", the highest ranking in the game's ladder system, which he reached in August 2015. However, Kripparrian is more known as an Arena, and more recently, Battlegrounds, player, where he is able to achieve high victory streaks despite having drafted poor cards. He is noted for his fun and innovative Hearthstone decks and spearheaded efforts, along with his wife, Rania, towards making Challengestone, a Hearthstone deckbuilding competition. GamesRadar listed Kripparrian's Twitch channel as one players should watch.\nKripparrian, AmazHS, and Frodan commentated the Hearthstone World Championship at Blizzcon 2015.\nMorosan's streams garner 50,512 viewers on average. In January 2017 and September 2018, he achieved first place in the first monthly \"Top 100\" leaderboard for North America players in the \"Arena\" game mode.\n\nPersonal life\nBefore his streaming career, Kripparrian worked as a computer technician after dropping out of college, where he was studying physics and mathematics.\nHe is married to Rania Chatzi Morosan (underflowR), who works as his manager and YouTube editor, as well as maintaining a YouTube channel with clips from the couple's life. They were married on October 31, 2014.\nMorosan lived in Athens, Greece for a year and a half with his wife. They currently reside in Canada, in a house they designed and built themselves. The couple have two dogs, a German Shepherd named Dexter and a Corgi named Fey.\nMorosan is a vegan.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nKripparrian on Twitch\nKripparrian's channel on YouTube",

The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration, ambush, reconnaissance, espionage, deception, and later bodyguarding. Antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century. There is little evidence that they were assassins.\nIn the unrest of the Sengoku period, jizamurai families, that is, elite peasant-warriors, in Iga Province and the adjacent Kōka District formed ikki – \"revolts\" or \"leagues\" – as a means of self-defense. They became known for their military activities in the nearby regions and sold their services as mercenaries and spies. It is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. Following the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity. A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).\nBy the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water, and control over natural elements. Much of their perception in popular culture is based on such legends and folklore, as opposed to the covert actors of the Sengoku period.\n\nEtymology\nNinja is the on'yomi (Early Middle Chinese–influenced) reading of the two kanji \"忍者\". In the native kun'yomi reading, it is pronounced shinobi, a shortened form of shinobi-no-mono (忍びの者).\nThe word shinobi appears in the written record as far back as the late 8th century in poems in the Man'yōshū. The underlying connotation of shinobi (忍) means \"to steal away; to hide\" and—by extension—\"to forbear\", hence its association with stealth and invisibility. Mono (者) means \"a person\".\nHistorically, the word ninja was not in common use, and a variety of regional colloquialisms evolved to describe what would later be dubbed ninja. Along with shinobi, these include monomi (\"one who sees\"), nokizaru (\"macaque on the roof\"), rappa (\"ruffian\"), kusa (\"grass\") and Iga-mono (\"one from Iga\"). In historical documents, shinobi is almost always used.\nKunoichi (くノ一) is, originally, an argot which means \"woman\";: p168  it supposedly comes from the characters くノ一 (respectively hiragana ku, katakana no and kanji ichi), which make up the three strokes that form the kanji for \"woman\" (女).: p168  In fiction written in the modern era kunoichi means \"female ninja\".: p167 \nIn English, the plural of ninja can be either unchanged as ninja, reflecting the Japanese language's lack of grammatical number, or the regular English plural ninjas.\n\nHistory\nDespite many popular folktales, historical accounts of the ninja are scarce. The social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret, trading their service for money without honor and glory. \nHowever, some ninjutsu books described specifically what tactics ninja should use to fight, and the scenarios in which a ninja might find themselves can be deduced from those tactics. For example, in the manuscript of volume 2 of Kanrin Seiyō (間林清陽) which is the original book of Bansenshūkai (万川集海), there are 48 points of ninja's fighting techniques, such as how to make makibishi from bamboo, how to make footwear that makes no sound, fighting techniques when surrounded by many enemies, precautions when using swords at night, how to listen to small sounds, kuji-kiri that prevents guard dogs from barking, and so on.\n\nPredecessors\nThe title ninja has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 2nd-century prince Yamato Takeru. In the Kojiki, the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the Kumaso people. However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the shinobi of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of Prince Shōtoku in the 6th century. Such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times, when, according to the 10th-century Shōmonki, the boy spy Hasetsukabe no Koharumaru was killed for spying against the insurgent Taira no Masakado. Later, the 14th-century war chronicle Taiheiki contained many references to shinobi and credited the destruction of a castle by fire to an unnamed but \"highly skilled shinobi\".\n\nEarly history\nIt was not until the 15th century that spies were specially trained for their purpose. It was around this time that the word shinobi appeared to define and clearly identify ninja as a secretive group of agents. Evidence for this can be seen in historical documents, which began to refer to stealthy soldiers as shinobi during the Sengoku period. Later manuals regarding espionage are often grounded in Chinese military strategy, quoting works such as The Art of War by Sun Tzu.\nBy the Sengoku period, the shinobi had several roles, including spy (kanchō), scout (teisatsu), surprise attacker (kishu), and agitator (konran). The ninja families were organized into larger guilds, each with their own territories. A system of rank existed. A jōnin (\"upper person\") was the highest rank, representing the group and hiring out mercenaries. This is followed by the chūnin (\"middle person\"), assistants to the jōnin. At the bottom was the genin (\"lower person\"), field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions.\n\nIga and Kōga clans\nThe Iga and Kōga \"clans\" were jizamurai families living in the province of Iga (modern Mie Prefecture) and the adjacent region of Kōka (later written as Kōga), named after a village in what is now Shiga Prefecture. From these regions, villages devoted to the training of ninja first appeared. The remoteness and inaccessibility of the surrounding mountains in Iga may have had a role in the ninja's secretive development.  The chronicle Go Kagami Furoku writes, of the two clans' origins:\n\nThere was a retainer of the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, of pre-eminent skill in shinobi, and consequently for generations the name of people from Iga became established. Another tradition grew in Kōga.\nLikewise, a supplement to the Nochi Kagami, a record of the Ashikaga shogunate, confirms the same Iga origin:\n\nInside the camp at Magari of the shōgun [Ashikaga] Yoshihisa there were shinobi whose names were famous throughout the land. When Yoshihisa attacked Rokkaku Takayori, the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, who served him at Magari, earned considerable merit as shinobi in front of the great army of the shōgun. Since then successive generations of Iga men have been admired. This is the origin of the fame of the men of Iga.\nThese professional ninja were actively hired by daimyōs between 1485 and 1581. Specifically, the Iga professionals were sought after for their skill at siege warfare, or \"shirotori\", which included night attacks and ambush. By the 1460s, the leading families in the regions had established de facto independence from their shugo. The Kōka ikki persisted until 1574, when it was forced to become a vassal of Oda Nobunaga. The Iga ikki continued until 1581, when Nobunaga invaded Iga Province and wiped out the organized clans. Survivors were forced to flee, some to the mountains of Kii, but others arrived before Tokugawa Ieyasu, where they were well treated. Some former Iga clan members, including Hattori Hanzō, would later serve as Tokugawa's bodyguards. Prior to the conquest of Kōka in 1574, the two confederacies worked in alliance together from at least 1487.\nFollowing the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, Tokugawa employed a group of eighty Kōga ninja, led by Tomo Sukesada. They were tasked to raid an outpost of the Imagawa clan. The account of this assault is given in the Mikawa Go Fudoki, where it was written that Kōga ninja infiltrated the castle, set fire to its towers, and killed the castellan along with two hundred of the garrison.\n\nActivities under Tokugawa\nAfter the assassination of Oda Nobunaga, Iga and Kōka ninja, according to tradition, helped Ieyasu undergo an arduous journey to escape the enemies of Nobunaga in Sakai and return to Mikawa. However, their journey was very dangerous due to the existence of \"Ochimusha-gari\" groups across the route. During this journey, Tokugawa generals such as Ii Naomasa, Sakai Tadatsugu and Honda Tadakatsu fought their way through raids and harassment from Ochimusha-gari (Samurai hunter) outlaws to secure the way for Ieyasu, while sometimes advancing by usage of gold and silver bribes given to some of the more amenable Ochimusha-gari groups. As they reached Kada, an area between Kameyama town and Iga, The attacks from Ochimusha-gari finally ended as they reached the former territory of the Kōka ikki, who were friendly to the Tokugawa clan. The Koka ninja assisted the Tokugawa escort group in eliminating the threats of Ochimusha-gari outlaws then escorting them until they reached Iga Province, where they were further protected by samurai clans from Iga ikki which accompanied the Ieyasu group until they safely reached Mikawa. The Ietada nikki journal records that the escort group of Ieyasu has killed some 200 outlaws during their journey from Osaka.\nThe Kōga ninja are said to have played a role in the later Battle of Sekigahara (1600), where several hundred Kōga assisted soldiers under Torii Mototada in the defence of Fushimi Castle. After Tokugawa's victory at Sekigahara, the Iga acted as guards for the inner compounds of Edo Castle, while the Kōga acted as a police force and assisted in guarding the outer gate. In 1603, a group of ninja warriors from Iga clan led by Miura Yo'emon were assigned under the command of Red Demon brigades of Ii Naomasa, the daimyo of Hikone under Tokugawa shogunate.\nIn 1608, a daimyo named Tōdō Takatora was assigned by Ieyasu to control of Tsu, a newly established domain which covered portions of Iga and Ise Province. The domain at first worth of to the 220,000, then grow further in productivity to the total revenue of 320,000 koku under Takatora governance. It was reported that Tōdō Takatora employs the Iga-ryū Ninjas. Aside from Ninjas, he also employs local clans of Iga province as \"Musokunin\", which is a class of part time Samurai who has been allowed to retain their clan name but does not own any land or Han. The Musokunin also worked as farmer during peace, while they are obliged to take arms in the time of war.\nIn 1614, The Iga province warriors saw action during the siege of Osaka. Takatora brought the Musokunin auxiliaries from Iga province to besiege the Osaka castle during the winter phase. Meanwhile the ninja units of Iga province were deployed under several commanders such as Hattori Hanzō, and Yamaoka Kagetsuge, and Ii Naotora, heir of Naomasa who also given control of Ii clan's Red Demons ninjas after Naomasa died. Later in 1615, during the summer phase of Osaka siege, The Ii clan Red Demons ninjas led by Miura Yo'emon, Shimotani Sanzo, Okuda Kasa'emon, and Saga Kita'emon saw action once again during the Battle of Tennōji, as they were reportedly fought together with the Tokugawa regular army storming on the south gate of Osaka castle. In 1614, the initial \"winter campaign\" at the Siege of Osaka saw the ninja in use once again. Miura Yoemon, a ninja in Tokugawa's service, recruited shinobi from the Iga region, and sent 10 ninja into Osaka Castle in an effort to foster antagonism between enemy commanders.During the later \"summer campaign\", these hired ninja fought alongside regular troops at the Battle of Tennōji.\n\nShimabara rebellion\nA final but detailed record of ninja employed in open warfare occurred during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638). The Kōga ninja were recruited by shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu against Christian rebels led by Amakusa Shirō, who made a final stand at Hara Castle, in Hizen Province. A diary kept by a member of the Matsudaira clan, the Amakusa Gunki, relates: \"Men from Kōga in Ōmi Province who concealed their appearance would steal up to the castle every night and go inside as they pleased.\"\nThe Ukai diary, written by a descendant of Ukai Kanemon, has several entries describing the reconnaissance actions taken by the Kōga.\n\nThey [the Kōga] were ordered to reconnoitre the plan of construction of Hara Castle, and surveyed the distance from the defensive moat to the ni-no-maru (second bailey), the depth of the moat, the conditions of roads, the height of the wall, and the shape of the loopholes.\n\nSuspecting that the castle's supplies might be running low, the siege commander Matsudaira Nobutsuna ordered a raid on the castle's provisions. Here, the Kōga captured bags of enemy provisions, and infiltrated the castle by night, obtaining secret passwords. Days later, Nobutsuna ordered an intelligence gathering mission to determine the castle's supplies. Several Kōga ninja—some apparently descended from those involved in the 1562 assault on an Imagawa clan castle—volunteered despite being warned that chances of survival were slim. A volley of shots was fired into the sky, causing the defenders to extinguish the castle lights in preparation. Under the cloak of darkness, ninja disguised as defenders infiltrated the castle, capturing a banner of the Christian cross. The Ukai diary writes,\n\nWe dispersed spies who were prepared to die inside Hara castle. ... those who went on the reconnaissance in force captured an enemy flag; both Arakawa Shichirobei and Mochizuki Yo'emon met extreme resistance and suffered from their serious wounds for 40 days.\nAs the siege went on, the extreme shortage of food later reduced the defenders to eating moss and grass. This desperation would mount to futile charges by the rebels, where they were eventually defeated by the shogunate army. The Kōga would later take part in conquering the castle:\n\nMore and more general raids were begun, the Kōga ninja band under the direct control of Matsudaira Nobutsuna captured the ni-no-maru and the san-no-maru (outer bailey)\nWith the fall of Hara Castle, the Shimabara Rebellion came to an end, and Christianity in Japan was forced underground. These written accounts are the last mention of ninja in war.\n\nEdo period\nAfter the Shimabara Rebellion, there were almost no major wars or battles until the bakumatsu era. To earn a living, ninja had to be employed by the governments of their Han (domain), or change their profession. Many lords still hired ninja, not for battle but as bodyguards or spies. Their duties included spying on other domains, guarding the daimyō, and fire patrol. A few domains like Tsu, Hirosaki and Saga continued to employ their own ninja into the bakumatsu era, although their precise numbers are unknown.\nMany former ninja were employed as security guards by the Tokugawa shogunate, though the role of espionage was transferred to newly created organizations like the onmitsu and the oniwaban. Others used their ninjutsu knowledge to become doctors, medicine sellers, merchants, martial artists, and fireworks manufacturers. Some unemployed ninja were reduced to banditry, such as Fūma Kotarō and Ishikawa Goemon.\n\nNinja stereotypes in theatre\nMany ubiquitous stereotypes about ninja were developed within Edo theatre. These include their black clothing, which was supposed to imitate the outfits worn by kuroko, stagehands meant to be ignored by the audience; and their use of shuriken, which was meant to contrast with the use of swords by onstage samurai. In kabuki theatre, ninja were \"dishonorable and often sorcerous counterparts\" to samurai, and possessed \"almost, if not outright, magical means of camouflage.\"\n\nContemporary\nBetween 1960 and 2010 artifacts dating to the Siege of Odawara (1590) were uncovered which experts say are ninja weapons. Ninja were spies and saboteurs and likely participated in the siege. The Hojo clan failed to save the castle from Toyotomi Hideyoshi forces. The uncovered flat throwing stones are likely predecessors of the shuriken. The clay caltrops preceded makibishi caltrops. Archeologist Iwata Akihiro of Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore said the flat throwing stones \"were used to stop the movement of the enemy who was going to attack [a soldier] at any moment, and while the enemy freezed the soldier escaped,\". The clay caltrops could \"stop the movement of the enemy who invaded the castle,\" These weapons were hastily constructed yet effective and used by a \"battle group which can move into action as ninjas\".\nMie University founded the world's first research centre devoted to the ninja in 2017. A graduate master course opened in 2018. It is located in Iga (now Mie Prefecture). There are approximately 3 student enrollments per year. Students must pass an admission test about Japanese history and be able to read historical ninja documents. Scientific researchers and scholars of different disciplines study ancient documents and how it can be used in the modern world.\nOn June 19, 2022, Kōka city in Shiga Prefecture announced that a written copy of \"Kanrinseiyo\", which is the original source of a famous book on the art of ninja called \"Bansenshukai\" (1676) from the Edo period was discovered in a warehouse of Kazuraki Shrine. The handwritten reproduction was produced in 1748. The book describes 48 types of ninjutsu. It has information about specific methods such as attaching layers of cotton to the bottom of straw sandals to prevent noise when sneaking around, attacking to the right when surrounded by a large number of enemies, throwing charred owl and turtle powder when trying to hide, and casting spells. It also clarified methods and how to manufacture and use ninjutsu tools, such as cane swords and \"makibishi\" (Japanese caltrop).\n\nRoles\nIn his Buke Myōmokushō, military historian Hanawa Hokinoichi writes of the ninja:\n\nThey travelled in disguise to other territories to judge the situation of the enemy, they would inveigle their way into the midst of the enemy to discover gaps, and enter enemy castles to set them on fire, and carried out assassinations, arriving in secret.\n\nEspionage\nEspionage was the chief role of the ninja. With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the Nochi Kagami briefly describes the ninja's role in espionage:\n\nConcerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and Kōga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret. They observed hidden things, and were taken as being friends.\nLater in history, the Kōga ninja would become regarded as agents of the Tokugawa bakufu, at a time when the bakufu used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional daimyōs as well as the Imperial court.\n\nSabotage\nArson was the primary form of sabotage practiced by the ninja, who targeted castles and camps.\nThe Tamon-in Nikki (16th century)—a diary written by abbot Eishun of Kōfuku-ji temple—describes an arson attack on a castle by men of the Iga clans.\n\nThis morning, the sixth day of the 11th month of Tenbun 10 [1541], the Iga-shu entered Kasagi castle in secret and set fire to a few of the priests' quarters. They also set fire to outbuildings in various places inside the San-no-maru. They captured the ichi-no-maru (inner bailey) and the ni-no-maru (second bailey).\nIn 1558, Rokkaku Yoshikata employed a team of ninja to set fire to Sawayama Castle. A chūnin captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed bakemono-jutsu (\"ghost technique\"), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy's family crest (mon), and proceeded to make replicas with the same mon. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka's army would later emerge victorious. The mercenary nature of the shinobi is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under Kizawa Nagamasa hired three Iga ninja of genin rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in Maibara. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder—and target of attack. The Asai Sandaiki writes of their plans: \"We employed shinobi-no-mono of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle\". However, the mercenary shinobi were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the shinobi. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa's army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush.\n\nCountermeasures\nA variety of countermeasures were taken to prevent the activities of the ninja. Precautions were often taken against assassinations, such as weapons concealed in the lavatory, or under a removable floorboard. Buildings were constructed with traps and trip wires attached to alarm bells.\nJapanese castles were designed to be difficult to navigate, with winding routes leading to the inner compound. Blind spots and holes in walls provided constant surveillance of these labyrinthine paths, as exemplified in Himeji Castle. Nijō Castle in Kyoto is constructed with long \"nightingale\" floors, which rested on metal hinges (uguisu-bari) specifically designed to squeak loudly when walked over. Grounds covered with gravel also provided early notice of unwanted intruders, and segregated buildings allowed fires to be better contained.\n\nForeign ninja\nOn February 25, 2018, Yamada Yūji, the professor of Mie University and historian Nakanishi Gō announced that they had identified three people who were successful in early modern Ureshino, including the ninja Benkei Musō (弁慶夢想). Musō is thought to be the same person as Denrinbō Raikei (伝林坊頼慶), the Chinese disciple of Marume Nagayoshi. It came as a shock when the existence of a foreign samurai was verified by authorities.\n\nFamous people\nMany famous people in Japanese history have been associated or identified as ninja, but their status as ninja is difficult to prove and may be the product of later imagination. Rumors surrounding famous warriors, such as Kusunoki Masashige or Minamoto no Yoshitsune sometimes describe them as ninja, but there is little evidence for these claims.\nSome well known examples include:\n\nKumawaka (the 16th century): a suppa (ninja) who served Obu Toramasa (1504– 1565), a vassal of Takeda Shingen.\nHattori Hanzō (1542–1596): a samurai serving under Tokugawa Ieyasu. His ancestry in Iga province, along with ninjutsu manuals published by his descendants have led some sources to define him as a ninja. This depiction is also common in popular culture.\nIshikawa Goemon (1558–1594): Goemon reputedly tried to drip poison from a thread into Oda Nobunaga's mouth through a hiding spot in the ceiling, but many fanciful tales exist about Goemon, and this story cannot be confirmed.\nFūma Kotarō (d. 1603): a ninja rumored to have killed Hattori Hanzō, with whom he was supposedly rivals. The fictional weapon Fūma shuriken is named after him.\nMomochi Sandayū (16th century): a leader of the Iga ninja clans, who supposedly perished during Oda Nobunaga's attack on Iga province. There is some belief that he escaped death and lived as a farmer in Kii Province. Momochi is also a branch of the Hattori clan.\nFujibayashi Nagato (16th century): considered to be one of three \"greatest\" Iga jōnin, the other two being Hattori Hanzō and Momochi Sandayū. Fujibayashi's descendants wrote and edited the Bansenshukai.\nKatō Danzō (1503–1569): a famed 16th-century ninja master during the Sengoku period who was also known as \"Flying Katō\".\nWada Koremasa (1536–1571): a powerful Kōka samurai ninja who in 1568 allied with the Ashikaga shogunate and Oda Nobunaga, at which point he relocated to Settsu Province.\nShimotsuge no Kizaru (16th century): an influential Iga ninja who in 1560 successfully led an attack on Tōichi Castle.\nTakino Jurobei (16th century): The commander of some of the final resistance against Oda Nobunaga in his invasion of Iga. Momochi Sandayu, Fujibayashi Nagato no Kami, and Hattori Hanzō served as his officers.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe image of the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on historical figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually make their way into comics and television, where they have come to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.\nNinja appear in many forms of Japanese and Western popular media, including books (Kōga Ninpōchō), movies (Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Ninja Assassin), television (Akakage, The Master, Ninja Warrior), video games (Shinobi, Ninja Gaiden, Tenchu, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima), anime (Naruto, Ninja Scroll, Gatchaman), manga (Basilisk, Ninja Hattori-kun, Azumi), Western animation (Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu) and American comic books (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). From ancient Japan to the modern world media, popular depictions range from the realistic to the fantastically exaggerated, both fundamentally and aesthetically.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nKhevtuul\nKunoichi\nModern schools of ninjutsu\nNinja Museum of Igaryu\nOrder of Musashi Shinobi Samurai\nPre-modern special forces\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nNinja magazine",

        "content": "Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in seven distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas; Lego Fortnite, an open world game collection divided between survival game Lego Fortnite Odyssey and social game Lego Fortnite Brick Life; Rocket Racing, a racing game; Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game; and Fortnite Ballistic, a tactical first-person shooter currently in early access. All game modes except Save the World are free-to-play.\nSave the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019, and it has been listed among the greatest games of all time.\nSave the World is available for macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative were released for all those platforms as well as Android and iOS devices and Nintendo Switch. The game also launched with the release of the ninth-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. Furthermore, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Fortnite Ballistic are available on all platforms.\n\nGame modes\nFortnite has multiple game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics and art assets. Five of these modes are directly created and managed by Epic Games and its subsidiaries:\n\nFortnite: Save the World is a player-versus-environment cooperative game, with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions while avoiding the effects of an encroaching cataclysmic storm. The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\nFortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map, and then scavenge for weapons, items, and resources while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters until the last player or team is alive. Alongside the main Battle Royale mode, three additional modes are also available: Zero Build, which removes building elements, Reload, which allows players to respawn after dying for a set amount of time, and OG, which re-introduces the classic Chapter 1 map and weapons. Furthermore, \"Party Royale\" served as a social space, which hosted various concert events.\nLego Fortnite is a platform for Lego-based games. The platform includes Odyssey, a survival sandbox game, where players play as Lego Minifig versions of characters, as they collect materials, build various buildings, craft various weapons and tools and fight against monsters; and Brick Life, a social-based game designed as an age-appropriate Grand Theft Auto game.\nRocket Racing is a racing game, developed by Psyonix and serving as a spin-off title to Rocket League. Players race vehicles, gaining speed boosts from special lanes sections or by drifting, as well as the ability to jump and racing on vertical and inverted surfaces, while avoiding obstacles on the course.\nFortnite Festival is a rhythm game developed by Harmonix, consisting of three modes. In the \"Main Stage\", players play popular hit songs and original tracks created by Harmonix and the Epic Games Sound Team, hitting notes to the rhythm in the Main Stage on one of the four unique parts: Lead, Guitar/Bass, Drums and Vocals, in a manner similar to Harmonix's Rock Band games, while the \"Battle Stage\" pits sixteen players to get the highest score and survive each round until one player remains. In the \"Jam Stage\", players cooperate to make remixes, similar to Harmonix' Dropmix and Fuser, using any part of any song within Festival mode, in which are also usable in Battle Royale, Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).\nFortnite Ballistic is a five-on-five, round-based tactical shooter, comparable to Counter-Strike and Valorant, to launch in early access on December 11, 2024. One team must plant and protect a rift device while it is charging from the opposing team that seeks to eliminate them and disarm the device. Between rounds, players are able to buy in-game weapons and gear from currency earned in previous rounds. Ballistic is the first Epic-developed game on the Fortnite platform to directly support a first-person view.\nIn addition to these modes, Fortnite offers the sandbox mode, Fortnite Creative. Within this mode, players are given complete freedom to spawn any item from the Battle Royale gamemode on a personal island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges, and more. Furthermore, it also supports Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), which allows players to edit worlds using Fortnite assets. Creative and UEFN also allows players to create custom Fall Guys games which can be accessible within the Fortnite launcher. \nAll modes except Save the World are free-to-play; Save the World is pay-to-play. The games are monetized through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in Save the World. In other modes, V-Bucks can be used to buy cosmetic items such as character models or the game's battle pass, a tiered progression of customization rewards for gaining experience and completing certain objectives during the course of a Battle Royale season. The battle pass originally was aimed to support Fortnite Battle Royale, and with the expansion of game modes in 2023, two addition passes were added, the Festival Pass for Fortnite Festival and Lego Pass for Lego Fortnite, each which required progression in those modes to receive rewards. In November and December 2024, Epic changed these mechanics, allowing both of those passes to be progressed through experience points earned in any Fortnite game mode, as well as renaming the Festival Pass to Music Pass. Similarly, the Fortnite Crew, a monthly subscription that paid for the cost of the main battle pass and additional cosmetics, was expanded during the same time to encompass the Music and Lego passes.\nAll modes of Fortnite are cross-platform play compatible, requiring users to use an Epic Games account for cross-saving between platforms.\n\nDevelopment history\nFortnite: Save the World (2011–2017)\nFortnite began from an internal game jam at Epic Games following the publishing of Gears of War 3 around 2011. Though it was not initially one of the developed titles during the jam, the concept of merging the construction game genre, representing games like Minecraft and Terraria, and shooter games arose, leading to the foundation of Fortnite. Development of Fortnite slowed due to several issues, including switching from the Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4, a deeper role-playing game approach to extend the life of the game, and a switch of art style from a dark theme to a more cartoonish style. Further, Epic was looking to get into the games as a service model, and brought in Chinese publisher Tencent to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including Cliff Bleszinski, who had been a key part of Fortnite's development. Fortnite's approach was changed to be Epic's testbed for games as a service, and further slowed the development.\nEpic was able to prepare to release Fortnite as a paid early access title in July 2017, with plans to release it as free-to-play sometime in 2019 while gaining feedback from players to improve the game. With the release of Fortnite Battle Royale, the player-versus-environment mode was distinguished as \"Save the World\". Ultimately, Epic opted to release Save the World as a premium title, bringing it out of early access on June 29, 2020.\n\nFortnite Battle Royale (2017–2018)\nNear the same time that Epic released Fortnite into early access, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds had become a worldwide phenomenon, having sold over 5 million copies three months from its March 2017 release, and drawing strong interest in the battle royale genre. Epic recognized that with the Fortnite base game, they could also do a battle royale mode, and rapidly developed their own version atop Fortnite in about two months. By September 2017, Epic was ready to release this as a second mode from \"Save the World\" in the paid-for earlier access, but then later decided to release it as a free game, Fortnite Battle Royale, supported with microtransactions. This version quickly gained players, with over 10 million players during its first two weeks of release, and leading Epic to create separate teams to continue the Fortnite Battle Royale development apart from the Save the World version, outside of common engine elements and art assets. This allowed Fortnite Battle Royale to expand to other platforms otherwise not supported by Save the World, including iOS and Android mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch.\n\nFortnite Creative (2018–2023)\nA creative sandbox mode launched on December 6, 2018, synchronized with the start of season 7 of Fortnite Battle Royale. Each player has access to a private, persistent island on which they construct buildings and add and manipulate objects as desired. Players are able to invite friends to this island and participate in unofficial games such as race tracks or jumping courses. Only players who purchased the battle pass initially received their own island, but a week later, on December 13, players who did not purchase it received access to the game mode for free.\n\nFortnite Experiences (2023–present)\nIn March 2023, Epic released the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), a standalone editor for Windows. UEFN allows creators to use the Unreal Editor with features of Unreal Engine 5 and Fortnite assets in developing new modes within the Fortnite Creative mode; this mode was called \"Creative 2.0\".\nIn October 2023, Epic redesigned the main Fortnite client to present Epic's own various modes as well as the numerous creative modes as part of Fortnite Experiences, comparable to Roblox in presentation. This was followed by the introduction of three new Epic-developed modes for the game in December 2023: Lego Fortnite, a survival game developed in conjunction with The Lego Group, Rocket Racing, an arcade-style driving game developed by Psyonix, and Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game developed by Harmonix. Each mode was introduced as free-to-play, interfacing with the game's battle pass system, and offering new rewards associated with those modes.\nNumerous improvements in UEFN were announced in March 2024, including the addition of Unreal Engine's MetaHuman character rendering technology, and more assets from Lego, Rocket Racing, and Fall Guys. Epic also stated their intent to have future Fortnite Battle Royale seasons starting in late 2025 to be developed in UEFN.\n\nReception\nThe Save the World mode achieved over one million players by August 2017, just prior to the release of Battle Royale.\nFortnite Battle Royale became a significant financial success for Epic Games, leading them to separate the teams between Save the World and Battle Royale to provide better support for both modes. Within two weeks of release, over 10 million players had played the mode, and by June 2018, just after the Nintendo Switch release, had reached 125 million players. Revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale during the first half of 2018 had been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month, with total 2018 revenue estimated at $2.4 billion by analysis firm SuperData Research. Total revenue for Fortnite reached more than $9 billion by the end of 2019.\nFortnite Battle Royale has also become a cultural phenomenon, with several celebrities reporting they play the game, and athletes using Fortnite emotes as victory celebrations. A notable streaming event in March 2018, with streamer Ninja playing Fortnite Battle Royale alongside Drake, Travis Scott, Kim DotCom, and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, broke viewership records for Twitch to date, and led to Epic arranging a Fortnite Battle Royale pro–am with 50 pairs of streamers and professional players matched with celebrities at E3 2018 in June 2018. Epic Games has developed organized esports competitions around Fortnite Battle Royale, such as the inaugural US$30 million Fortnite World Cup tournament that took place in July 2019 and the Fortnite Championship Series (FNCS), the latter of which would be organized by Epic Games in 2020 and 2021 before being organized by Blast ApS from 2022 onwards.\n\nThere has also been growing concern over Fortnite Battle Royale's draw toward young children, emphasized with the release of the mobile client. Parents and teachers had expressed concern that students are being distracted and drawn away from school work due to playing Fortnite. Concerns have also been raised about the impact that playing a game involving repeated depictions of gun violence may have on young children.\n\nAwards\nIn 2017, the game was nominated for \"Best Co-op Game\" by PC Gamer, and for \"Best Spectator Game\" by IGN. In 2018, the game won the award for Best Ongoing Game by PC Gamer and IGN, the latter of which nominated it for \"Best Nintendo Switch Game\", \"Best Mobile Game\", and \"Best Action Game\".\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nFortnite at IMDb",

        "content": "Panganiban, officially the Municipality of Panganiban, is a municipality in the province of Catanduanes, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 9,713 people.\nIt is formerly known as Payo.\n\nEtymology\nAlthough the original name was Payo, this town has changed name from Panganiban to Payo and back again. During the last term of the late assemblyman Francisco Perfecto, Panganiban became Payo again on April 20, 1957, under Republic Act No. 1654. Congressman Jose M. Alberto (through Republic Act 2122 enacted without executive approval April 15, 1959) changed the name to Panganiban again by which it is officially known at present.\nAccording to legend, the town's early settlers elected a tribal chief whom they called “Payo” which could have been their vernacular term for headman.\n\nHistory\nOn January 1, 1921, Governor General Francis B. Harrison signed into law Executive Order No. 55 officially segregating the municipality from Viga; thenceforth was called Panganiban, in honor of José María Panganiban, whose relative – Jose Blanca Panganiban – stood as sponsor during the inauguration.\n\nGeography\nIt is situated on the northern part of Catanduanes, with its eastern part facing the Pacific Ocean. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Bagamanoc, on the south by the municipality of Viga, and on the west by the municipality of Caramoran which is covered by a dense forest.\nThe town proper is 55 kilometres (34 mi) from Virac, the capital town and commercial center of the province. Panganiban is 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from  Viga and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Bagamanoc.\nBagamanoc was created from barrios of Quigaray, Hinipagan, Sukhan in the island of Panay; Lati, in the island of Lati; Bacac, Hinipaan, Bugao, Minaili and Bagamanoc of the municipality of Panganiban by virtue of Republic Act No. 491 which was approved on June 12, 1950.\nThe municipal councils of Bagamanoc and Panganiban agreed on the boundary of the two towns on June 12, 1952. The agreement was approved by the provincial council of Catanduanes on July 12, 1952. The Congress formalized the agreement by passing Republic Act No. 1038 which was approved on June 12, 1954. The boundary was stated thus:\n\nThe boundary of Panay Island between the municipalities of Bagamanoc and Panganiban is a straight line from Amontol Point to Tubigmanoc. The territory west of the line belongs to the former municipality and the territory east of the line belongs to the latter. The boundary in Panganiban Bay is a straight line from Amontol Point to the mouth of the Pangcayanan Creek. The territory north-west of the line belongs to the former and the territory south-west of the line belongs to the latter. The boundary in the mainland of said municipalities extends from the mouth of Pangcayanan Creek following the natural course of said creek up to the concrete culvert and from that point of straight line to sitio Inacban: Provided, That sitio Inacban belongs to the municipality of Panganiban.\n\nBarangays\nPanganiban is politically subdivided into 23 barangays.  Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.\n\nClimate\nPanganiban has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round and with extremely heavy rainfall in November and December.\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2020 census, the population of Panganiban was 9,713 people, with a density of 120 inhabitants per square kilometre or 310 inhabitants per square mile.\n\nEconomy\nPoverty incidence of Panganiban\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nPhilippine Standard Geographic Code\nPhilippine Census Information\nMunicipality of Panganiban, Catanduanes",

        "content": "Imane Anys (; Arabic: إِيمَان أَنِيس, born 14 May 1996), known professionally as Pokimane ( or ), is a Canadian-Moroccan online streamer, YouTuber and influencer. She is best known for her live streams on Twitch, where she broadcasts video game content, most notably in Valorant and Fortnite. She is a co-founder of OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group of content creators.\n\nEarly life\nImane Anys was born in Morocco on 14 May 1996. Her parents were academics who immigrated to Quebec, Canada. She grew up in St. Catharines, Ontario. In middle school, Anys began playing massively multiplayer online games such as MapleStory and Endless Online, where she focused on customization and socializing with other players. Anys studied chemical engineering at McMaster University but later dropped out to pursue her streaming career full-time.\n\nCareer\nTwitch streaming\nAnys created her Twitch account in June 2013. She began streaming later that year with a $250 PC she bought off a classifieds website after she reached Platinum rank in League of Legends. The name Pokimane is a portmanteau of Pokémon and her name, Imane.\nShe gained 450,000 followers on Twitch in 2017, earning her account a place within the 100 most followed on the platform. As a result of her account's rise on the platform in 2017, the Shorty Awards named her as the Best Twitch Streamer of the year. The Shorty Awards detailed that her gameplay and commentary on the popular game League of Legends propelled her to popularity on Twitch. Anys had a cameo appearance in a League of Legends trailer announcing a new game mode.\nAnys has been known to stream gameplay and commentary of Fortnite, which she first streamed as part of a sponsorship. At E3 in 2018, Epic Games, the developers of Fortnite, arranged a pro–am event. The event paired streamers with mainstream celebrities in a match of Fortnite's Battle Royale mode; Anys was paired with rapper Desiigner but shortly before the event, he was replaced with basketball player Josh Hart. In mid-March 2019, Anys addressed her declining amount of Fortnite streams, stating that she needed to \"think about what I like or dislike about the content that I've been making.\"\nTech news website Digital Trends detailed that Anys frequently interacts with her audience and described her \"laidback but enthusiastic personality\" as \"perfectly suited to long-form streams.\" Aside from streaming gaming content, Anys also podcasts and streams miscellaneous real-world moments.\nAs one of the more popular streamers on the platform, Twitch has directly partnered with Anys. In July 2018, Twitch selected her as one of 15 ambassadors for the 2018 iteration of their TwitchCon event. Later that month, Twitch also scheduled Anys as a partner for their Twitch Creator Camp, a series of broadcasts and articles designed to help content creators build successful channels. In March 2020, Anys signed a multi-year exclusivity with Twitch. Social Blade listed Anys as the 9th-most-followed user on Twitch, with over 8.5 million followers as of 21 December 2021.\nIn late October 2020, Anys collaborated with U.S. representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar along with several other notable streamers including Disguised Toast and HasanAbi for a session of Among Us as part of a get-out-the-vote initiative for the 2020 United States presidential election.\nAnys was named a featured honoree in the 2021 Forbes 30 Under 30 under the category of \"Games\", which noted her prominence as the largest female streamer on Twitch and as one of the founders of OfflineTV. She had 8.5 million followers on Twitch as of July 2021.\nOn 8 January 2022, Anys' Twitch account was suspended for 48 hours midway through an Avatar: The Last Airbender watch stream following a DMCA claim from ViacomCBS. Later in the month, Anys' stream was hate raided by viewers of JiDion. He was later banned, which received the attention of streamer Ninja, who stated he would use his connections to get the ban reversed. Anys criticized this response from Ninja, particularly calling out Ninja's use of the word bitches when speaking on the issue. Anys and JiDion have since made amends.\nIn February 2022, Anys re-signed with Twitch.\nOn 30 January 2024, Anys announced that she would stop streaming on Twitch stating that she was \"done with Twitch's messy behaviour\" citing the changes that the company has made in recent years. However, she has continued to stream.\nOn 22 October 2024, Anys and fellow streamer Valkyrae hosted a livestream featuring U.S. senator Bernie Sanders in support of the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign. Also featured in the broadcast were streamers AustinShow and Sykkuno, Hank Green, Mark Cuban, and Mark Hamill.\n\nYouTube\nIn addition to streaming on the Twitch platform, Anys also has multiple YouTube channels: Pokimane, Pokimane Too, Pokimane VODS, Poki ASMR, and imane. Don't Tell Anyone With Pokimane  However, in 2021, Anys publicly announced that she had stopped doing ASMR, due to the amount of time and dedication it takes to make ASMR videos. The Pokimane channel features edited gaming clips from streams while Pokimane Too includes unrelated clips of her gaming content, vlogs, and podcast. On the Pokimane VODS channel, full unedited VOD clips of streams are uploaded. The Poki ASMR channel featured videos that are part of a broader YouTube community of ASMR content, though Anys has ceased uploading on the channel. In 2021, Anys launched a new channel entitled simply 'imane' which covers more personal topics and vlogs rather than gaming-related topics.\nAnys was also a member of OfflineTV, a collaborative YouTube channel made up of content creators. Speaking about the channel, Anys stated, \"it's not fun being a streamer and living alone, so we decided to come together in a way so we not only keep each other company but we can also collab and actually do good work and content for everyone else.\"\n\nOther ventures\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Anys, among a number of other internet personalities, would appear in the film Free Guy, directed by Shawn Levy, which was released in August 2021. She also appeared in the music video for Bella Poarch's song \"Inferno\", released in August 2021.\nIn October 2021, it was announced that Anys had helped launch a talent management and brand consulting firm called RTS, where she will serve as the Chief Creative Officer.\nOn 13 November 2023, Anys announced she launched Myna, a company that sells \"healthy snack alternative\" cookies. One four-pack of the company's midnight mini cookies product were sold for $28, drawing criticism from some calling the cookies overpriced. On November 18, during a livestream, she responded to the criticism stating, \"When people are like 'oh my god $28 for cookies'. It's four bags, that's $7 per bag. I know, I know math is hard when you're an idiot. But, if you're a broke boy just say so\". Her usage of \"broke\" as an insult attracted further backlash.\nOn 12 December 2023, Anys launched her first podcast called Don't Tell Anyone.\nOn 17 January 2024, Anys made a special guest appearance at Samsung's biannual Galaxy Unpacked event, where she demonstrated the new gaming features of the S24 Series of devices' adaptive displays.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nMusic videos\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Pokimane at Wikimedia Commons\nPokimane at IMDb",

        "content": "Smoke is a suspension of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative.\n\nSmoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.\nSmoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.\n\nChemical composition\nThe composition of smoke depends on the nature of the burning fuel and the conditions of combustion. Fires with high availability of oxygen burn at a high temperature and with a small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, while nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Contents of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to the production of hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and antimony oxides and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).\n\nPyrolysis of burning material, especially incomplete combustion or smoldering without adequate oxygen supply, also results in production of a large amount of hydrocarbons, both aliphatic (methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene) and aromatic (benzene and its derivates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; e.g. benzo[a]pyrene, studied as a carcinogen, or retene), terpenes. It also results in the emission of a range of smaller oxygenated volatile organic compounds (methanol, acetic acid, hydroxy acetone, methyl acetate and ethyl formate) which are formed as combustion by products as well as less volatile oxygenated organic species such as phenolics, furans and furanones. Heterocyclic compounds may be also present. Heavier hydrocarbons may condense as tar; smoke with significant tar content is yellow to brown. Combustion of solid fuels can result in the emission of many hundreds to thousands of lower volatility organic compounds in the aerosol phase. Presence of such smoke, soot, and/or brown oily deposits during a fire indicates a possible hazardous situation, as the atmosphere may be saturated with combustible pyrolysis products with concentration above the upper flammability limit, and sudden inrush of air can cause flashover or backdraft.\nPresence of sulfur can lead to formation of gases like hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon disulfide, and thiols; especially thiols tend to get adsorbed on surfaces and produce a lingering odor even long after the fire. Partial oxidation of the released hydrocarbons yields in a wide palette of other compounds: aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acrolein, and furfural), ketones, alcohols (often aromatic, e.g. phenol, guaiacol, syringol, catechol, and cresols), carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, etc.).\nThe visible particulate matter in such smokes is most commonly composed of carbon (soot). Other particulates may be composed of drops of condensed tar, or solid particles of ash. The presence of metals in the fuel yields particles of metal oxides. Particles of inorganic salts may also be formed, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or sodium chloride. Inorganic salts present on the surface of the soot particles may make them hydrophilic. Many organic compounds, typically the aromatic hydrocarbons, may be also adsorbed on the surface of the solid particles. Metal oxides can be present when metal-containing fuels are burned, e.g. solid rocket fuels containing aluminium. Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target ignite, producing particles of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.) Magnetic remanence, recorded in the iron oxide particles, indicates the strength of Earth's magnetic field when they were cooled beyond their Curie temperature; this can be used to distinguish magnetic particles of terrestrial and meteoric origin. Fly ash is composed mainly of silica and calcium oxide. Cenospheres are present in smoke from liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Minute metal particles produced by abrasion can be present in engine smokes. Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen. The silica particles have about 10 nm size, clumped to 70–100 nm aggregates and further agglomerated to chains. Radioactive particles may be present due to traces of uranium, thorium, or other radionuclides in the fuel; hot particles can be present in case of fires during nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl disaster) or nuclear war.\nSmoke particulates, like other aerosols, are categorized into three modes based on particle size:\n\nnuclei mode, with geometric mean radius between 2.5 and 20 nm, likely forming by condensation of carbon moieties.\naccumulation mode, ranging between 75 and 250 nm and formed by coagulation of nuclei mode particles\ncoarse mode, with particles in micrometer range\nMost of the smoke material is primarily in coarse particles. Those undergo rapid dry precipitation, and the smoke damage in more distant areas outside of the room where the fire occurs is therefore primarily mediated by the smaller particles.\nAerosol of particles beyond visible size is an early indicator of materials in a preignition stage of a fire.\nBurning of hydrogen-rich fuel produces water vapor; this results in smoke containing droplets of water. In absence of other color sources (nitrogen oxides, particulates...), such smoke is white and cloud-like.\nSmoke emissions may contain characteristic trace elements. Vanadium is present in emissions from oil fired power plants and refineries; oil plants also emit some nickel. Coal combustion produces emissions containing aluminium, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, selenium, and uranium.\nTraces of vanadium in high-temperature combustion products form droplets of molten vanadates. These attack the passivation layers on metals and cause high temperature corrosion, which is a concern especially for internal combustion engines. Molten sulfate and lead particulates also have such effect.\nSome components of smoke are characteristic of the combustion source. Guaiacol and its derivatives are products of pyrolysis of lignin and are characteristic of wood smoke; other markers are syringol and derivates, and other methoxy phenols. Retene, a product of pyrolysis of conifer trees, is an indicator of forest fires. Levoglucosan is a pyrolysis product of cellulose. Hardwood vs softwood smokes differ in the ratio of guaiacols/syringols. Markers for vehicle exhaust include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, steranes, and specific nitroarenes (e.g. 1-nitropyrene). The ratio of hopanes and steranes to elemental carbon can be used to distinguish between emissions of gasoline and diesel engines.\nMany compounds can be associated with particulates; whether by being adsorbed on their surfaces, or by being dissolved in liquid droplets. Hydrogen chloride is well absorbed in the soot particles.\nInert particulate matter can be disturbed and entrained into the smoke. Of particular concern are particles of asbestos.\nDeposited hot particles of radioactive fallout and bioaccumulated radioisotopes can be reintroduced into the atmosphere by wildfires and forest fires; this is a concern in e.g. the Zone of alienation containing contaminants from the Chernobyl disaster.\nPolymers are a significant source of smoke. Aromatic side groups, e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation of smoke. Aromatic groups integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production of smoke. Higher degree of cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.\n\nVisible and invisible particles of combustion\nThe naked eye detects particle sizes greater than 7 μm (micrometres). Visible particles emitted from a fire are referred to as smoke. Invisible particles are generally referred to as gas or fumes. This is best illustrated when toasting bread in a toaster. As the bread heats up, the products of combustion increase in size. The fumes initially produced are invisible but become visible if the toast is burnt.\nAn ionization chamber type smoke detector is technically a product of combustion detector, not a smoke detector. Ionization chamber type smoke detectors detect particles of combustion that are invisible to the naked eye. This explains why they may frequently false alarm from the fumes emitted from the red-hot heating elements of a toaster, before the presence of visible smoke, yet they may fail to activate in the early, low-heat smoldering stage of a fire.\nSmoke from a typical house fire contains hundreds of different chemicals and fumes. As a result, the damage caused by the smoke can often exceed that caused by the actual heat of the fire. In addition to the physical damage caused by the smoke of a fire – which manifests itself in the form of stains – is the often even harder to eliminate problem of a smoky odor. Just as there are contractors that specialize in rebuilding/repairing homes that have been damaged by fire and smoke, fabric restoration companies specialize in restoring fabrics that have been damaged in a fire.\n\nDangers\nSmoke from oxygen-deprived fires contains a significant concentration of compounds that are flammable. A cloud of smoke, in contact with atmospheric oxygen, therefore has the potential of being ignited – either by another open flame in the area, or by its own temperature. This leads to effects like backdraft and flashover. Smoke inhalation is also a danger of smoke that can cause serious injury and death.\n\nMany compounds of smoke from fires are highly toxic and/or irritating. The most dangerous is carbon monoxide leading to carbon monoxide poisoning, sometimes with the additive effects of hydrogen cyanide and phosgene. Smoke inhalation can therefore quickly lead to incapacitation and loss of consciousness. Sulfur oxides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride in contact with moisture form sulfuric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid, which are corrosive to both lungs and materials. \n\nCigarette smoke is a major modifiable risk factor for lung disease, heart disease, and many cancers.  Smoke can also be a component of ambient air pollution due to the burning of coal in power plants, forest fires or other sources, although the concentration of pollutants in ambient air is typically much less than that in cigarette smoke.  One day of exposure to PM2.5 at a concentration of 880 μg/m3, such as occurs in Beijing, China, is the equivalent of smoking one or two cigarettes in terms of particulate inhalation by weight. The analysis is complicated, however, by the fact that the organic compounds present in various ambient particulates may have a higher carcinogenicity than the compounds in cigarette smoke particulates. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the combination of both sidestream and mainstream smoke emissions from a burning tobacco product. These emissions contain more than 50 carcinogenic chemicals. According to the United States Surgeon General's 2006 report on the subject, exposures to secondhand tobacco smoke can activate platelets causing increased clotting and increased risk of thrombus and potentially damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack. The chances of these effects occurring increase with increased exposure and time of exposure. The American Cancer Society lists \"heart disease, lung infections, increased asthma attacks, middle ear infections, and low birth weight\" as ramifications of smoker's emission.\n\n \nSmoke can obscure visibility, impeding occupant exiting from fire areas. In fact, the poor visibility due to the smoke that was in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire in Worcester, Massachusetts was the reason why the trapped rescue firefighters could not evacuate the building in time. Because of the striking similarity that each floor shared, the dense smoke caused the firefighters to become disoriented.\n\nCorrosion\nSmoke can contain a wide variety of chemicals, many of them aggressive in nature. Examples are hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, produced from halogen-containing plastics and fire retardants, hydrofluoric acid released by pyrolysis of fluorocarbon fire suppression agents, sulfuric acid from burning of sulfur-containing materials, nitric acid from high-temperature fires where nitrous oxide gets formed, phosphoric acid and antimony compounds from P and Sb based fire retardants, and many others. Such corrosion is not significant for structural materials, but delicate structures, especially microelectronics, are strongly affected. Corrosion of circuit board traces, penetration of aggressive chemicals through the casings of parts, and other effects can cause an immediate or gradual deterioration of parameters or even premature (and often delayed, as the corrosion can progress over long time) failure of equipment subjected to smoke. Many smoke components are also electrically conductive; deposition of a conductive layer on the circuits can cause crosstalks and other deteriorations of the operating parameters or even cause short circuits and total failures. Electrical contacts can be affected by corrosion of surfaces, and by deposition of soot and other conductive particles or nonconductive layers on or across the contacts. Deposited particles may adversely affect the performance of optoelectronics by absorbing or scattering the light beams.\nCorrosivity of smoke produced by materials is characterized by the corrosion index (CI), defined as material loss rate (angstrom/minute) per amount of material gasified products (grams) per volume of air (m3). It is measured by exposing strips of metal to flow of combustion products in a test tunnel. Polymers containing halogen and hydrogen (polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins with halogenated additives, etc.) have the highest CI as the corrosive acids are formed directly with water produced by the combustion, polymers containing halogen only (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene) have lower CI as the formation of acid is limited to reactions with airborne humidity, and halogen-free materials (polyolefins, wood) have the lowest CI. However, some halogen-free materials can also release significant amount of corrosive products.\nSmoke damage to electronic equipment can be significantly more extensive than the fire itself. Cable fires are of special concern; low smoke zero halogen materials are preferable for cable insulation.\nWhen smoke comes into contact with the surface of any substance or structure, the chemicals contained in it are transferred to it. The corrosive properties of the chemicals cause the substance or structure to decompose at a rapid rate. Certain materials or structures absorb these chemicals, which is why clothing, unsealed surfaces, potable water, piping, wood, etc., are replaced in most cases of structural fires.\n\nHealth effects of wood smoke\nWood smoke is a major source of air pollution, especially particulate pollution, pollution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde.\nIn the United Kingdom domestic combustion, especially for industrial uses, is the largest single source of PM2.5 annually. In some towns and cities in New South Wales, wood smoke may be responsible for 60% of fine particle air pollution in the winter. A year-long sampling campaign in Athens, Greece found a third (31%) of PAH urban air pollution to be caused by wood-burning, roughly as much as that of diesel and oil (33%) and gasoline (29%). It also found that wood-burning is responsible for nearly half (43%) of annual PAH lung cancer-risk compared to the other sources and that wintertime PAH levels were 7 times higher than in other seasons, presumably due to an increased use of fireplaces and heaters. The largest exposure events are periods during the winter with reduced atmospheric dispersion to dilute the accumulated pollution, in particular due to the low wind speeds. Research conducted about biomass burning in 2015, estimated that 38% of European total particulate pollution emissions are composed of domestic wood burning.\nWood smoke (for example from wildfires or wood ovens) can cause lung damage, artery damage and DNA damage leading to cancer, other respiratory and lung disease and cardiovascular disease. Air pollution, particulate matter and wood smoke may also cause brain damage because of particulates breaching the cardiovascular system and into the brain, which can increase the risk of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders mental disorders, and suicidal behavior, although studies on the link between depression and some air pollutants are not consistent. At least one study has identified \"the abundant presence in the human brain of magnetite nanoparticles that match precisely the high-temperature magnetite nanospheres, formed by combustion and/or friction-derived heating, which are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter (PM).\" Air pollution has also been linked to a range of other psychosocial problems.\n\nMeasurement\nAs early as the 15th century Leonardo da Vinci commented at length on the difficulty of assessing smoke, and distinguished between black smoke (carbonized particles) and white 'smoke' which is not a smoke at all but merely a suspension of harmless water particulates.\nSmoke from heating appliances is commonly measured in one of the following ways:\nIn-line capture. A smoke sample is simply sucked through a filter which is weighed before and after the test and the mass of smoke found. This is the simplest and probably the most accurate method, but can only be used where the smoke concentration is slight, as the filter can quickly become blocked.\nThe ASTM smoke pump is a simple and widely used method of in-line capture where a measured volume of smoke is pulled through a filter paper and the dark spot so formed is compared with a standard.\nFilter/dilution tunnel. A smoke sample is drawn through a tube where it is diluted with air, the resulting smoke/air mixture is then pulled through a filter and weighed. This is the internationally recognized method of measuring smoke from combustion.\nElectrostatic precipitation. The smoke is passed through an array of metal tubes which contain suspended wires. A (huge) electrical potential is applied across the tubes and wires so that the smoke particles become charged and are attracted to the sides of the tubes. This method can over-read by capturing harmless condensates, or under-read due to the insulating effect of the smoke. However, it is the necessary method for assessing volumes of smoke too great to be forced through a filter, i.e., from bituminous coal.\nRingelmann scale. A measure of smoke color. Invented by Professor Maximilian Ringelmann in Paris in 1888, it is essentially a card with squares of black, white and shades of gray which is held up and the comparative grayness of the smoke judged. Highly dependent on light conditions and the skill of the observer it allocates a grayness number from 0 (white) to 5 (black) which has only a passing relationship to the actual quantity of smoke. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the Ringelmann scale means that it has been adopted as a standard in many countries.\nOptical scattering. A light beam is passed through the smoke. A light detector is situated at an angle to the light source, typically at 90°, so that it receives only light reflected from passing particles. A measurement is made of the light received which will be higher as the concentration of smoke particles becomes higher.\nOptical obscuration. A light beam is passed through the smoke and a detector opposite measures the light. The more smoke particles are present between the two, the less light will be measured.\nCombined optical methods. There are various proprietary optical smoke measurement devices such as the 'nephelometer' or the 'aethalometer' which use several different optical methods, including more than one wavelength of light, inside a single instrument and apply an algorithm to give a good estimate of smoke. It has been claimed that these devices can differentiate types of smoke and so their probable source can be inferred, though this is disputed.\nInference from carbon monoxide. Smoke is incompletely burned fuel, carbon monoxide is incompletely burned carbon, therefore it has long been assumed that measurement of CO in flue gas (a cheap, simple and very accurate procedure) will provide a good indication of the levels of smoke. Indeed, several jurisdictions use CO measurement as the basis of smoke control. However it is far from clear how accurate the correspondence is.\n\nMedicinal smoking\nThroughout recorded history, humans have used the smoke of medicinal plants to cure illness. A sculpture from Persepolis shows Darius the Great (522–486 BC), the king of Persia, with two censers in front of him for burning Peganum harmala and/or sandalwood Santalum album, which was believed to protect the king from evil and disease. More than 300 plant species in 5 continents are used in smoke form for different diseases. As a method of drug administration, smoking is important as it is a simple, inexpensive, but very effective method of extracting particles containing active agents. More importantly, generating smoke reduces the particle size to a microscopic scale thereby increasing the absorption of its active chemical principles.\n\nSee also\nAir purifier\nBonfire\nGreat Smog of London\nHealth impacts of sawdust\nInversion (meteorology)\nJoss paper\nOpen burning of waste\nSmog\nUltrafine particle\n\nReferences\nSources\n\"Smoke\" .

        "content": "William Savage Ebers Neff (born September 14, 1989) is an American Twitch streamer, YouTuber, and actor. He is the co-host of the game show Name Your Price, alongside fellow Twitch streamer AustinShow. He is also a co-host of the Fear& podcast.\n\nEarly life\nWilliam Savage Ebers Neff was born on September 14, 1989. Through the birthplace of one of his grandfathers, he is of German descent. His father Robert Arthur Neff is a retired business and financial executive.\nHe attended high school at Blair Academy, a boarding and day prep school in Blairstown, New Jersey, where he was captain of the squash team. He graduated with a master's degree in game and interactive media design from Elon University in Elon, North Carolina. During his studies, Neff interned at both Second City in Chicago (2008) and Laugh Factory in Los Angeles (2012). Previously, he honed his improv skills at The Groundlings, a theater and improv club. Neff also previously worked as a narrative-focused video producer for BuzzFeed, an American internet media company.\n\nCareer\nStreaming\nNeff created his Twitch channel in April 2016 but did not begin streaming until August 2018, where he primarily streamed League of Legends gameplay. In May 2020, he created his YouTube channel, where he uploads highlights from his Twitch streams.\nNeff's online popularity surged in 2020, which he attributes to the COVID-19 lockdowns. He is known for his collaborative streams with fellow Twitch streamers Hasan Piker and AustinShow.\nOn May 5, 2021, Neff received a two-day Twitch ban for watching a clip of Samurai Jack on Adult Swim's official YouTube channel. In November 2021, he joined 100 Thieves, a Los Angeles-based gaming organization, as a content creator. However, his tenure was brief as he signed with One True King in 2024.\nOn April 27, 2023, Neff participated in Esfand's Draft Day Extravaganza, a football event to coincide with the first day of the NFL draft. He would return the following year for coverage of the 2024 NFL draft.\nOn February 5, 2024, One True King, an American media organization based in Austin, Texas, announced that Neff would be joining the organization as a content creator. Neff would also be appearing in and hosting several shows created with the organization, including the OTK Film Festival in March 2024. On September 26, 2024, Neff received a two-day Twitch ban for streaming The Shawshank Redemption during his “film school” sessions.\n\nAttack of the Show!\nNeff was one of the hosts of the G4TV program Attack of the Show!, an American television program focused on pop culture, video games, and movies, after it was relaunced in November 2021. Neff said that being a fan of G4 growing up was one of the reasons he joined as one of the program hosts. The show was discontinued a year later, after Comcast announced the disbandment of G4TV due to financial problems.\n\nName Your Price\nOn February 10, 2022, Neff joined fellow Twitch streamer AustinShow as a co-host for Name Your Price, a 1970s-themed game show inspired by The Price Is Right. The show aired on AustinShow's Twitch channel for two seasons before its cancellation due to the closure of G4 in October 2022. In March 2023, following AustinShow's signing with Misfits Gaming, the show's revival was announced.\nOn October 9, 2023 Name Your Price returned for a third season, adopting a touring format for the first time.

        "streamer": "CENTRAL_COMMITTEE",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_committee",
        "content": "A central committee is a political-executive organ designated as the highest organ of a communist party between two congresses. Per the principles of democratic centralism, a central committee is empowered to deal with any issue that falls under the party's purview. While formally retaining this role in socialist states, commonly referred to as communist states by outside observers, in practice, it delegates this authority to numerous smaller internal organs due to the infrequency of its meetings. The term of a central committee of a ruling communist party is usually five years. The party congress elects individuals to the central committee and holds it accountable. At the first central committee session held immediately after a congress, it elects the party leader, an office usually titled general secretary of the central committee, a political organ, commonly known as the politburo, and an executive organ, customarily named the secretariat.\n\nStatus\nCommunist parties are organised on Leninist lines based on the principles of democratic centralism. Adolf Dobieszewski, an official of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP), tried to define democratic centralism in 1980. He posited that centralism involves unifying party building and policy to construct a socialist society. To achieve unity in party building and policy, Dobieszewski contended that the minority had to be subordinate to the majority. Secondly, he posited that lower-level organs were subservient to higher-level organs. Third, members willingly acquiesced to discipline, and political discipline was equally obligatory for all party members. Democracy, on the other hand, meant, according to Dobieszewski, that every member had equal opportunity to participate in the formulation of the party's programme and line, as well as the right to elect and recall officials at all levels. The power was organised as a uniform structure, with the highest party organs, such as the congress functioning as the party's \"supreme organ\". This supreme organ is responsible for electing the central committee, which is typically tasked with directing the work of the communist party in between two congresses. According to scholar Baruch Hazan, the former ruling Eastern European communist parties provided nearly identical descriptions of the functions and powers of their central committees. Their responsibilities included representing the party externally, organising party organs, directing their activities, nominating personnel for internal organs, evaluating party cadres, and administering internal funds. Additionally, they were responsible for overseeing the work of state organs, granting approval to the state plan and budget ahead of the discussions in the highest organ of state power, and endorsing the appointments of individuals to prominent state roles. However, more generally, central committees are empowered to deal with any issue that falls under the party's purview.\n\nRelationship to the state\nMost communist states formally enshrine the communist party's leading or guiding role in state and society, and this is institutionalised by giving the party two-thirds of the seats in the highest organ of state power, which has complete control over all state activities per the principle of unified power. These members are, in most cases, elected in non-competitive elections and stand as candidates on the approval of the central committee. Many central committee members also serve concurrently as members of the highest organ of state power. In the Soviet Union, 227 out of 241 members of the Central Committee of the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) concurrently served in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. They tended to dominate the Supreme Soviet and occupied leading political positions within it. In 1971–1973, forty per cent of debate participants were either members or alternates of the central committee. Party members who serve in the highest organ of state power are also bound by party discipline and have to enact policies approved by the central committee.\nThe leading role principle entails that the central committee adopts recommendations on state policy on behalf of the party to, most commonly, the highest organ of state power, but also to other state organs if deemed necessary. For instance, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (HSWP) \"adopted recommendations for filling of jobs in the state apparatus\" to the highest organ of state power, the National Assembly, on 29 March 1979. In other instances, the central committee could instruct its members to resign from state offices. The 7th Session of the Central Committee of the 8th PUWP Congress, held on 1–2 December 1980, instructed Edward Babiuch, Jerzy Łukaszewicz, Tadeusz Pyka, Jan Szydlak, Tadeusz Wraszczyk, and Zdzisław Zandarowski to resign their seats in the Sejm, the highest organ of state power in the People's Republic of Poland, and instructing its former leader, Edward Gierek, to resign from his seat in the State Council. The central committee could also nominate individuals to state positions. On 11 April 1984, during the 1st Session of the 11th Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev nominated Konstantin Chernenko as chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union \"on instructions of the Central Committee\". Upon his election, Chernenko nominated Nikolai Tikhonov as chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Soviet government, also on the instructions of the Central Committee. Moreover, Chernenko and Gorbachev both stated that the instruction had also been \"approved by the party group\" of the Supreme Soviet.\nMarxist constitutional theorist Sylwester Zawadzki, and member of the highest organ of state power of Poland, defined the relationship between the party and state as follows, \"The Marxist-Leninist party gives political direction to the work of both the [Highest organ of state power] and the Government. [Highest organ of state power] and Government both work to carry out a common program for building socialism. It does not mean, however, that under\nthese conditions the importance of the [highest organ of state power's] constitutional functions is reduced.\" In practice, the party's central committee normally discusses and adopts the state plan and budget before the highest organ of state power does. On 25 November 1981, the RCP Central Committee convened to discuss and adopt the state plan and budget. Two days later, on 27 November, the Romanian highest organ of state power, the Great National Assembly, convened and adopted the central committee's proposals. Moreover, the speakers that spoke at the central committee sessions usually speak at the session of the highest organ of state power. Very few debates take place at the session of the highest organ of state power, and in most cases, these organs adopt the central committee's recommendations unanimously. This was not always the case. The Assembly of Yugoslavia rejected bills, the Polish Sejm voted against government appointments and, under Gorbachev's leadership, the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet regularly voted contrary to the wishes of the Soviet government and party leaders. \n\nThere have been several attempts to reform the relationship between the central committee and the highest organ of state power. In China, according to scholar Anthony Saich, \"the party cannot guarantee absolute support [in the highest organ of state power] and has accepted a looser form of control than during the Maoist days when the [National People's Congress] (NPC) was simply stocked with model workers and peasants, pliant intellectuals and senior party leaders.\" The first reforms were instituted in 1991, when the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) adopted a regulation that limited the party's interference in the work of China's highest organ of state power, the NPC. The document clarifies that the CPC has the right to review all proposed laws, but detailed scrutiny of articles and other legal features should be left to the NPC. In line with this, the number of negative votes by NPC deputies against proposed legislation and candidates has increased since 1991. The NPC has also rejected proposed legislation, such as the \"Highway Law of the People's Republic of China\" in 1999 and the \"Property Law of the People's Republic of China\" in 2006. In both cases, the proposed legislation was amended and passed at a later date.\nIn some cases, the central committee adopts decisions on behalf of state organs despite it not being in their jurisdiction. This occurred at a session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPCZ) on 13–14 September 1979 when it removed Jan Gregor, Frantisek Hamouz and Bohuslav Vecera from their government posts. Another example is the Extraordinary Plenary Session of the PUWP Central Committee on 9 February 1981 that removed Józef Pińkowski, the sitting head of government, and replaced him with Wojciech Jaruzelski.\n\nOrganisation\nSessions\nRuling central committees normally can convene for three meeting types: sessions (also called plenums), extraordinary sessions, and joint sessions. These three types have two sub-forms: a closed session and an enlarged session in which non-members are invited to participate. Central committee sessions dealing with non-party issues are often enlarged, even if what is discussed is routine in nature. These sessions are in most cases organised identically, and the key speech is often delivered by a central committee secretary responsible, for example, for economic affairs or international affairs. The discussions at the sessions are very seldom made public, but adopted resolutions are sometimes made public and session communiques are nearly always distributed to the public. In some instances, the number of non-members exceeds that of central committee members. The Romanian Communist Party (RCP) did this, and the Central Committee of the 12th RCP Congress convened an enlarged session on 1 June 1982 attended by 360 guests to discuss the \"current stage of building socialism in Romania\".\nSessions dealing exclusively with party affairs are usually closed. These sessions' most common agenda item is \"organisational matters\", meaning personnel changes in party and state organs. The communiques published by these sessions are usually brief and say little to nothing about the reason for the changes. But this was not abnormal. For instance, the official communique of the 13th Session of the Central Committee of the 7th Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), held on 11–12 December 1980, only notes that two politburo members, Günter Mittag and Gerhard Schürer, spoke at the session, that fifteen central committee members participated in session discussions and that it approved the SED Politburo's report and the proposed economic plan for 1981. The same rule regards extraordinary sessions, both ordinary and enlarged, as well. In some cases, these sessions were made public long after the fact. For example, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) reported that an \"important\" Central Committee session had taken place 1–2 July 1976, but only informed the public that \"measures to ensure the consistent and all-round implementation of the decisions of the 11th BCP Congress\" had been adopted and discussed. What these measures were was not made public. The importance of the session was indicated by the fact that Todor Zhivkov, the first secretary of the BCP Central Committee, \"read a detailed report\" to the session. However, the report's content was not made public either. Despite the meeting's secretive nature, and the low level of transparency about it, the BCP Central Committee's main newspaper Rabotnichesko delo wrote, \"the entire population is called upon to fulfill the 'program' contained in the report.\" That is, the Bulgarian people were called to participate in implementing resolutions they were not acquainted with. In other more extreme cases, details of the \"historic\" central committee were kept a secret. For instance, the contents of the BCP Central Committee session on 17 April 1956 that removed Valko Chervenkov as general secretary were deemed too sensitive to be published even thirty years after the event took place.\nCentral committee sessions could also produce transparent communiques and resolutions. Scholar Hazan contends, \"As a rule, this is only the case after a routine [session], when nothing unusual has happened.\" These communiques were structured similarly throughout the communist world. Such sessions usually dealt with public matters, such as the economic plan and the state budget. For example, the HSWP Central Committee session held on 3 December 1981 transparently informed about which guests participated in the session and specifically stated what was discussed. In this, the communique stated, \"The Central Committee discussed and approved: a report submitted by Comrade Andreas Gyenes, secretary of the Central Committee, on topical international issues; and a proposal submitted by Comrade Ferenc Havasi, member of the Politburo and secretary of the Central Committee, on guiding principles for the 1982 plan and state budget.\" The ensuing communique summarised the international policy stance of the HSWP and outlined the basic features of the 1982 plan and budget. However, in other instances, the session makes public the resolutions adopted. For instance, the RCP Central Committee session on 9 February 1982 made public the resolution on \"Resetting of Prices and Augmentation of Remuneration of Working Personnel\". According to Hazan, the RCP Central Committee took this move to help justify the price increases to the population. In other cases, as with the PUWP Central Committee sessions from 1980 to 1982 and those of the LCY more generally, the agenda and proceedings of the sessions were made entirely public. In the PUWP, proceedings were aired live by state radio and television, while in Yugoslavia, public broadcasting of central committee sessions had been a normal occurrence since the early 1950s. For example, the 3rd Extraordinary Session of the Central Committee of the 6th LCY Congress, held on 16–17 January 1954, was both publicly broadcast and made public in written form in the LCY Central Committee's theoretical journal, Komunist. This is against the norm in most communist parties as the majority of them did, and still do, keep proceedings secret.\nSessions have, on several occasions, produced documents of an authoritative ideological nature. For instance, the RCP Central Committee session of 25 March 1981 clarified the party's foreign affairs policy and how it differed from other Eastern European communist parties. In other situations, as was a normal occurrence in former communist Europe (bar Yugoslavia), the central committee convened to express support for Soviet foreign policy. This occurred at the CPCZ Central Committee session on 21 April 1982, where Vasiľ Biľak, a member of the CPCZ Presidium, accused the United States of being an anti-Soviet state that refused \"to reconcile itself to the fact that it has lost its dominating position in the world policy and economy\". The session made clear its support for \"The Soviet peace initiatives aim at averting the danger of a world nuclear war\" which it argued corresponded \"to the vital interests and peace wishes of the Czechoslovak people.\"\n\nPermanent organs\nA central committee, not always the case in non-ruling parties, has two components: one composed of elected officials and another composed of non-elected officials. The non-elected officials compose the permanent organs of the central committee, which makes up the central committee apparatus. The activity of a central committee is constant and does not cease in between its sessions. The central committee usually has several internal departments, commissions, committees, newspapers and other organs working continuously when not in session. These organisational sub-units do everything from greeting foreign delegations, issuing regulations, monitoring the party as a whole and preparing agenda items and dossiers for politburo meetings. Because of the central committee's role in the political system of communist states, foreign observers often state that it has functions resembling parliaments in liberal democracies. For example, the central committee apparatus of the former communist ruling parties of Europe had twenty to thirty organisational subunits that covered everything from foreign relations and trade to sports and science, similar to parliamentary special committees. Some organisational units are deemed party secrets and not publicly acknowledged. Many organisational units are shared by all communist parties, such as having organisational units for agitation and propaganda and organisation. At the same time, others are unique, such as the Department of Western Affairs of the SED Central Committee. These organs are supervised by the secretariat, and this institutional function is usually vaguely stated in the party statute. The difference between elected and non-elected personnel in the apparatus is blurred, according to scholars Jerry F. Hough and Merle Fainsod, and using the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as an example, since \"each secretary has responsibility for one or more departments, and hence the departmental officials work as the staff assistants of the secretaries.\"\nThe permanent organs are often organised on branch lines. For example, the CPSU Central Committee had the Administrative Organs Department responsible for supervising the works of the ministries of Civil Aviation, Defence and the KGB, while the Chinese Communist Party has a Publicity Department responsible for supervising party and state media across China. Outside of these departments, central committees usually have other units as well, such as a publishing house, party schools, scholarly institutes and a capital construction section, for example. The leaders of these permanent organs are usually called \"heads\". The Secretariat is organised on similar lines as the permanent organs. In some instances, the secretaries head permanent organs in tandem with their supervisory responsibilities.\n\nLeading organs\nThe leading organs of a central committee, commonly designated as central leading organs, were elected organs delegated with all or some of the central committee's powers when it was not in session. Every ruling communist party had a politburo and secretariat, albeit the name might differ from party to party. Other central committees also elected a control commission, responsible for party discipline work, a central military commission, responsible for military affairs, an orgburo, responsible for organisational questions, or other organs.\nThe politburo was the highest political organ of the central committee and directed party work between central committee sessions. While formally accountable to the central committee, and despite reporting on its work to it, the politburo often ends up controlling the central committee. The politburos is often a small organ composed of anywhere from 10 to 30 members. In some parties, as in the RCP and in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the politburo has a standing committee that leads politburo work. In China, it is known as the Politburo Standing Committee, and in Romania, it was known as the Political Executive Committee. The members of a politburo are the highest-standing officials of the given communist party and are, in practice, the country's leading political elite. Members usually have varied political backgrounds and experience from party, executive, legislative, and judicial work.\nThe secretariat is responsible for overseeing the execution of the decisions of the politburo and the central committee, communicating with the nationwide party organisation and being responsible for personnel appointments throughout the party. For example, the CPSU statute, adopted at the 22nd Congress in 1961, stated that the CPSU Secretariat was \"to direct current work, chiefly the selection of personnel and the verification of the fulfilment of Party decisions.\" The most powerful individuals in the communist state system were politburo members who concurrently served as secretariat members, also referred to as secretaries of the central committee. The party leader, most often known as general secretary of the central committee, led the secretariat's work. As such, several scholars, like Darrell P. Hammer, Archie Brown and Wu Guoguang, have referred to the general secretary as the central committee's chief executive officer. While all ruling central committees have had secretariats at some points, some opted to abolish them. For example, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) opted to abolish its secretariat in 1966 to divide powers more equally. Later, in 1978, the 11th LCY Congress turned the Presidency, the Yugoslav counterpart to the politburo, into a \"political-executive organ\" in which no member could concurrently be a member and a secretary. Political work was headed by the president of the LCY Presidency, the party leader, and no member of the presidency could concurrently serve as a secretary, called executive secretary in the LCY. Executive work was led by the secretary of the LCY Presidency, and the officeholder was assisted by executive secretaries, who could not concurrently serve in the LCY Presidency but had to be members of the LCY Central Committee to be eligible to serve.\nA control commission is also widespread in communist parties, but the electoral procedure varies. For instance, the Communist Party of Vietnam's control organ, the Central Inspection Commission, is elected by a session of the central committee. In contrast, the CCP counterpart, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, is elected by the party congress. Control commissions in all these parties, whether elected by the central committee or congress, bear more or less the same functions and responsibilities. They are responsible for investigating disciplinary issues, screening party members, handling appeals against party decisions, combatting political corruption and, in instances where control and auditing functions have been merged, auditing the party's economic and financial affairs. In most cases, bar a few exceptions, these organs, no matter if they are elected by congress or a central committee session, work under the central committee's leadership. The LCY Control Commission worked under the central committee's leadership until the 9th LCY Congress, held in 1969, which transformed it into the only statutory review organ of a ruling communist party, the Commission on Statutory Questions. The 9th Extraordinary PUWP Congress, held in 1981, amended the party statute to state explicitly that the Control Commission worked independently of the PUWP Central Committee. In some parties, as in the CPCZ and the HSWP, the chairman and ordinary members of the party control commission are barred from holding office in the central committee. In other parties, as in China, the head of the control commission is also a member of its Central Committee, Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee.\n\nMembership\nElections and removals\nThe second to last session of a party congress usually elects the central committee. These sessions, especially in communist Eastern Europe, seldom lasted more than an hour. The congress closing session usually noted that the election of members and candidates to the central committee was carried out unanimously. However, this was not always the case: Nicolae Ceaușescu, the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party (RCP), told the 11th RCP Congress, held on 25–28 November 1974, that the central committee had been elected \"quasi-unanimously\". Criteria for membership differs from party to party. For example, Enver Hoxha, the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania (PLA), stated on 6 November 1981 at the 8th PLA Congress, that members were nominated based on their loyalty to the party and people, fidelity to Marxism–Leninism and their participating in socialist construction. Another criterion was age, with Hoxha noting that newer members were younger than incumbent ones. He also stated that party organizations had put forward over 2,000 potential candidates to the leadership but had shortened the list to 125 nominees for central committee membership. Hoxha's statement was, according to Hazan, vague but more transparent on election practices than most of his communist counterparts. The exception to this rule was the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY), which had instituted clear and transparent rules on elections to the LCY Central Committee. For example, the Sixth Session of the Central Committee of the 10th LCY Congress, held on 20 March 1978, instituted a system in which each republican branch had twenty representatives, each autonomous province had fifteen members, that the army branch had fifteen members in the central committee and that the president of the LCY Central Committee served as an ex officio central committee member. However, unlike the other ruling communist parties, the party congress did not elect the LCY Central Committee from 1974 onwards. The congresses and conferences of the LCY branches nominated individuals to serve in the LCY Central Committee, and the LCY congress decided on the eligibility of the candidates proposed.\nThe sitting party leadership usually controls congress proceedings, nominating candidates close to them and trying to remove opponents. Moreover, in some parties, as in the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP), the central committee was empowered to elect additional members between congresses, which the Central Committee of the 11th BCP Congress did do on two occasions. While most personnel changes did occur at congresses, removing or adding new central committee members between congresses occurred semi-regularly. The reasons for removing members varied. For instance, a session of the PUWP Central Committee, held on 4 September 1980, removed Edward Gierek, the incumbent first secretary of the PUWP Central Committee, due to his \"health issues\". Others were removed due to specific reasons; for instance, Edward Babiuch and Zdzislaw Zandarowski were removed for \"allowing distortions in interparty life, for shaping an incorrect style of party work, and for inadequate concern for the quality of party ranks\", while Jan Szydlak was removed \"for errors in economic policy and support for arbitrary action in this field.\" In other cases, the central committee elected additional members on the death of sitting member. For example, a session of the CPCZ Central Committee, held on 1 December 1977, opted to elect Miloš Jakeš to the central committee to replace the recently deceased Jan Baryl. Not every party did as the CPCZ; the HSWP Central Committee rarely replaced members who died in office. Other times, the removal of certain members was not explained. The RCP Central Committee session, held on 26 November 1981, published a communique that stated Leonte Răutu had been removed but did not disclose why. The same RCP session removed Virgil Trofin and Vasilie Ogherlaci and noted in the session communique that they were \"excluded from the Central Committee and punished by a vote of censure and warning.\" According to Hazan, its not certain that the decision to remove these figures was independently decided by central committee. The RCP Political Committee, the party's name for their politburo, had already decided to remove these members, and one can, therefore, construe the central committee's decision instead as a ratification of an already made decision.\n\nIn some cases, the party leadership lost control or chose to democratise congress proceedings. For instance, the 9th Extraordinary Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, held on 14–20 July 1981, was, according to Hazan, \"the only time that the election of an East European Central Committee was subjected to democratic procedures\", in the liberal democratic sense. The Electoral Commission of the 9th PUWP Congress originally proposed 200 nominees for 200 seats in the PUWP Central Committee, but provincial delegations from the floor nominated a further 79 candidates. The congress delegates then elected the central committee by secret vote by crossing of 79 candidates. The result was that eleven out of fifteen incumbent members of the Politburo and the Secretariat were voted out of office.\nNormally, up to two-thirds of central committee members are reelected at party congresses. Those who fail to get reelected are usually not victims of a purge. People often failed to get reelected since they lost or voluntarily left their political office. The central committees could be seen as representative organs of various political offices and institutions. Once an individual loses his or her political office, he or she also loses his or her central committee membership. In line with this reasoning, members lost reelection since the party leadership used the congress as an occasion to rearrange which institutions were to be represented in the central committee. In this way, the party leadership could guarantee that certain sectors were represented in the central committee. Despite this, many ruling central committees had elders in their ranks who had been members their whole careers. For example, in the HSWP by 1985, Antal Apró, Sándor Gáspár, Károly Kiss, István Szabó and Rezső Nyers had been central committee members since the party's seizure of power in 1948. Another interpretation, as outlined by Hazan, is that \"the exercise of electing a new Central Committee is designed to remove those elements that had, for various reasons, become undesirable, while promoting people faithful to the party leader and his closest associates.\"\n\nFunctions\nRepresentation\nSee also\nEastern Bloc politics\nPolitburo\nSecretariat\n\nReferences\nArticles\nBooks\nJournals\nReports\nThesis\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===",

        "content": "Seth Abner (born June 30, 1995), also known as scump, Smuck, scumperjumper or The King is an American content creator and former professional Call of Duty player who last played for the  Call of Duty League team OpTic Texas. Abner is a two time Major League Gaming (MLG) X Games gold medalist. During the first ever Esports Awards in 2016, Scump won the Esports Console Player of the Year award. In August 2017, Scump achieved his first ever Call of Duty World Championship. Abner is sponsored by several gaming hardware companies, including Turtle Beach and Scuf Gaming. He also runs a YouTube channel that currently has obtained over 2.8 million subscribers and over 665 million channel views as of November 10, 2023. He is widely considered to be the most popular and one of the greatest Call of Duty players of all time.\nIn March 2021, Scump became the first Esport athlete to be sponsored by Oakley.\n\nCall of Duty esports career\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II (2012–2013 season)\nScump played for OpTic for the Call of Duty: Black Ops II season. OpTic would take their only 1st-place finish at UMG Chicago, but would never finish outside of the top 10. OpTic achieved a 3rd-place finish at the 2013 Call of Duty Championship to finish off the 2012–2013 season.\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts (2013–2014 season)\nScump stayed on OpTic going into the Call of Duty: Ghosts season. However, after a 9th-place finish at the MLG Fall Championship and a 13th-place finish at UMG Philadelphia, Scump announced he would be leaving OpTic and joining Team EnVyUs alongside Merk, ProoFy, and Goonjar because of a rivalry with Nadeshot. Less than two-weeks after his departure from OpTic, Scump announced that he was leaving Envy and returning to Optic. He would rejoin the lineup of Nadeshot, MBoZe, and Clayster for the Call of Duty Championship 2014. The squad finished 3rd for the second year in a row. After that tournament, the team picked up ProoFy to replace MBoZe, who then became captain of OpTic Nation. The new team placed in the top eight at UGC Niagara, and was invited to attend the MLG X Games Invitational. Here, OpTic advanced all the way through their bracket to face Team Kaliber in the Grand Final. OpTic won, and Scump became one of the first gold medalists for Call of Duty. The next few events were inconsistent for OpTic, with 4th and 5th placings at Gfinity 3, UMG Dallas, UMG Nashville, and MLG CoD League Season 3 Playoffs.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014–2015 season)\nUpon release of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, OpTic parted ways with Clayster and ProoFy and added Matt \"Formal\" Piper, Ian \"Crimsix\" Porter to the team. The team initially placed second to Crimsix's longtime teammate Aches at the first event of the season, and afterwards placed first at UMG Orlando 2015, the MLG Pro League Season 1 Playoffs, and the Call of Duty Championship's NA Regional event. At the 2015 Call of Duty World Championship, the team placed a disappointing 7th after they went into the event as the clear favorites. After the event, Scumps's longtime teammate, Nadeshot, decided to leave competitive Call of Duty and was replaced by Damon \"Karma\" Barlow, with Scump becoming the team captain. As the new captain of OpTic Gaming, Scump led the team to 6 more championships and 2 more Pro League Regular Season wins to end the Advanced Warfare season. They won ESWC Zénith 2015 and Gfinity Spring Masters 1 with Enable in place of Karma, but as they returned to the United States they went to California to compete at UMG California 2015 with Karma. When they won UMG Cali it marked their 3rd straight event win in three consecutive weekends in three different countries. They then finished 1st in Season 2 of the MLG Pro League to qualify for MLG Pro League Season 2 Playoffs at the summer XGAMES in Austin, Texas, where he and OpTic defended their title and won his second gold medal. OpTic and Scump then finished 2nd to FaZe Clan at UMG Dallas 2015 and Gfinity Summer Championship. They bounced back as they won UMG Washington D.C. 2015 and MLG Pro League Season 3 Regular Season, where they went 11–0 in the season. Once again, they fell short and placed 2nd to Scump's ex-teammate, Clayster's FaZe team for the final time in AW. Scump then went on to win the final event of Advanced Warfare, MLG World Finals, with OpTic Gaming. He stated that the World Finals was the only event where he felt like he got carried, but it still marked Scump's and OpTic's most successful year by far. They won 9 championships, all 3 of the online Pro League Season, appeared in 10/11 Grand Finals, they won many online tournaments hosted by MLG and UMG, earned 1,651,320 pro points, and Scump had the most pro points out of any player with 447,975.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III (2015–2016 season)\nGoing into the Call of Duty: Black Ops III season Scump confirmed that OpTic Gaming would not be making any roster changes, like many other teams. OpTic Gaming went on to successfully qualify for the Call of Duty World League NA. OpTic gaming placed 2nd in the first event of the season, the \"Totino's invitational\", losing to Rise Nation in the final. After entering the next event with a top-4 seed, Seth and his team were met an even worse placing of 4–8 along with the other top-seeded teams, however the event suffered from technical difficulties leading to an apology from the event's management. Scump has won now two 25k tournaments hosted by UMG gaming and one 25k tournament hosted by ESL.\nAlongside teammates Crimsix and FormaL, and Karma, Scump won the 2016 Call of Duty World League Stage One Finals Tournament of North America for Call of Duty: Black Ops III. The tournament was presented by PS4 with a grand prize of $250,000 for the winning team. Scump also won MLG Anaheim and MLG Orlando with OpTic Gaming.\n\nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare (2016–2017 season)\nAfter competing at four Call of Duty World Championship events and failing to win first place at any, Scump achieved success at the 2017 Call of Duty World League Championship in the title of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. His team, Optic Gaming won first prize ($1.5 million) in the Call of Duty World League final.\n\nCall of Duty: World War II (2017–2018 season)\nInitially, Scump remained the leader of OpTic Gaming going into WWII. After inconsistent placings at numerous major events, the roster split up after a series of poor tournament placings, with Scump performing badly individually. They kicked FormaL and Karma and recruited players Sam 'Octane' Larew and Anthony 'Methodz' Zinni. But their problems weren't solved, as they placed 5–6th at the CWL Anaheim open, 7–8th at stage two playoffs and 17–24th in the 2018 Call of Duty Championship. This was the first time since Modern Warfare 2 that OpTic Gaming failed to win a single championship throughout a season.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018–2019 season)\nAt the beginning of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 season Scump teamed up with Karma, Crimsix, TJHaly and Dashy, as this was the first year that competitive Call of Duty used a five-man roster. OpTic Gaming won the first Black ops 4 tournament, CWL Las Vegas 2018, bringing home $100,000. As of 2019 Scump has had the 5th highest earnings in Call of Duty history ($652,140).\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019–2020 season)\nAhead of the 2019–2020 CDL season, Scump announced via his personal Twitter account that he had left OpTic Gaming. On October 24, 2019, it was announced by NRG Esports via its social media channels that Scump had joined its currently unnamed CDL franchise, which on October 30, 2019, would be named Chicago Huntsmen.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (2020–2021 season)\nAhead of the 2020-2021 CDL season, NRG Esports had aquired the OpTic Gaming brand and rebranded the Chicago Huntsmen into OpTic Chicago.\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard  (2021–2022 season)\nAhead of the 2021-2022 CDL season, Scump joined the newly formed OpTic Texas after OpTic Gaming merged with Dallas Empire's partner organzaton Envy.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022–2023 season)\nAhead of the 2022-2023 CDL season, Scump announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season.

As a professional Call of Duty player, Haag was a former captain of OpTic Gaming in the 2014 Call of Duty: Ghosts season and the 2014–2015 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare season, playing the objective support role.\nHaag is a Major League Gaming (MLG) X Games 2014 gold medalist and 2011 Call of Duty XP World Champion, winning Best eSports player at The Game Awards 2014. He is a former Red Bull esports athlete and participates in the Twitch streaming program. Haag was previously sponsored by several gaming hardware companies, including Astro Gaming and Scuf Gaming. He also runs a YouTube channel with over 3.2 million subscribers and over 270 hours of content.\n\nEarly life\nHaag was born on August 3, 1992, to Jeff and Christina Haag. He has a brother Kevin and sister Sarah.\nHaag attended Amos Alonzo Stagg High School in Palos Hills, Illinois, and graduated in 2010. He has also completed a two-year course in business studies at Moraine Valley Community College. Prior to competing in competitive gaming, Haag worked at a McDonald's restaurant.\n\nPlaying career\nEarly career\nHaag's gaming handle, \"NaDeSHoT\" originates from \"grenade shot\", a lethal move in the Halo series in which a grenade is followed by a gunshot Haag was a competitive amateur in the first-person shooter Halo 2, but switched to the third-person tactical shooter series, Gears of War after getting the game as a Christmas present. He narrowly missed qualifying for MLG Chicago in Gears of War play by one slot in 2007. He competed in his first professional online tournament in 2008 and at the age of 16 he made his professional debut on Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.\n\nOpTic career\nHaag became a member of OpTic Gaming in June 2010, when he first joined the OpTic competitive team. In 2014, he became the captain of OpTic Gaming after Will \"BigTymer\" Johnson resigned. Haag stepped down as OpTic Gaming's captain after a seventh-place finish at the 2015 Call of Duty Championship tournament. Nadeshot then decided to leave OpTic in 2016.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 2010–11 season\nHaag was dropped from the team for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 2011 season which was the first season of Call of Duty on the Major League Gaming circuit since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He briefly returned to the OpTic Competitive team, replacing a player who felt ill, at MLG Dallas where OpTic Gaming finished 3rd with virtually no practice as a squad. Subsequently, after mentioning the possibility of replacing the teammate that had fallen sick he did not get picked up. Haag played on several different teams in the professional scene and created his own OpTic Nation competitive team and started making videos and streaming footage. For the next two events he played for Team EnVyUs finishing 8th at MLG Anaheim and then 3rd at MLG Raleigh before playing on Surreal Legacy for the final two events of the year placing 7th at MLG Orlando and then finishing 15th at the MLG Providence national championships to finish off the Call of Duty: Black Ops Major League Gaming season.

With 2 members of the OpTic Gaming team not being available to play, Haag was picked up again. They made it to the Grand Final. They took the series 3-1 and Haag pocketed $100,000 with his team winning $400,000 and the trophy.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II 2012–13 season\nTreyarch were to make Call of Duty: Black Ops II which was the third game in the Black Ops franchise. The game was a success competitively and attracted a bigger audience through the season. With Frag Cup 4, an annual online tournament at the start of a new Call of Duty title, coming up a member of the OpTic Gaming competitive team was unable to play due to gambling restrictions in his province, and after impressing early on in the game, OpTic Gaming picked up Haag, who rejoined the OpTic Gaming competitive team on a permanent basis. They finished in the 7th/8th position in Frag Cup 4 before going to the first LAN event which was UMG Chicago. OpTic Gaming started the tournament strong, making their way to the finals without losing. The team then lost the first series in the final. However, because they were the winners of the 'winners final' the match went into a final and decisive series, in which they were able to win 3-2 and become the first Call of Duty: Black Ops II champions.\nThe next tournament was MLG Dallas. Here, the top 8 teams qualified to compete at that year's Call of Duty Championships, which was an annual $1,000,000 event. Haag and OpTic Gaming went on to finish in the 5th/6th position.\nAt the Call of Duty Championships, OpTic Gaming finished in third place losing to the eventual winners of the tournament. They then played in Gfinity 1 (G1) in London, United Kingdom and MLG Anaheim in Anaheim, California where were placed in third respectively at both events. The next event Haag attended was Gfinity (G2) in London. However, their new roster finished 9th–12th. Their performance at the MLG Fullsail Invitational, where the four highest ranked Black Ops II teams competed, (and which was to be OpTic Gaming and MLG's final event of the Call of Duty: Black Ops II competitive season) was much improved, finishing in second place behind Complexity Gaming.\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts 2013–14 season\nThe next title of the Call of Duty franchise was Call of Duty: Ghosts which MLG announced that it would be their featured FPS title for the upcoming season again. Haag and OpTic Gaming disappointed at both of their first two events which were to be MLG Columbus (13–16th place) and UMG Philadelphia (9–12th place) before a roster change occurred with one player retiring, two leaving and one later rejoining. During this time Haag teamed with Christopher Duarte, who goes by the name of 'Parasite'. At this time, the team consisted of 'NaDeSHoT', 'Clayster', 'Ricky' and 'Parasite'. However, after only a handful of days, 'Parasite' and 'Ricky' left OpTic to join Curse Las Vegas. OpTic then picked up 'Saints' and 'MBoZe', before 'Scumpii' rejoined OpTic to replace the departing 'Saints', who returned to Strictly Business. After the retirement of 'BigTymer' following UMG Philadelphia, Haag became the captain of OpTic Gaming.\nOptic, led by Haag, qualified for the Call of Duty: Ghosts national qualifiers for the annual Call of Duty Championship $1,000,000 tournaments after qualifying via MLG's online qualifying tournament. At the US Championship Finals OpTic Gaming finished in 7th place to qualify for the Call of Duty World Championship, after eliminating Curse New York in an elimination game in a best of 5 series. This allowed the team to qualify for the annual $1 million tournament. Haag and his OpTic Gaming squad played in the MLG Pro Circuit Season 1 online league where after a promising start they suffered problems online and were not able to qualify for the MLG PAX East Championship; eventually OpTic Gaming finished bottom of the league in 10th place. OpTic Gaming later announced that Haag and his teammates would be hosting the winners of the US Regional finals, Strictly Business Gaming for a pre-LAN event for the World Championships.\nAt the Call of Duty World Championships, OpTic were placed in a group with 'Epsilon eSports', 'NSP' and 'SSOF'; controversy was caused when 'SSOF' were disqualified and OpTic only had two teams in their group. OpTic first played 'NSP' and beat them 3-0 leading to a group decider against Epsilon where Haag and his team lost 3–0. However they advanced as the second seed and faced tK in the first round of the winners bracket. Haag led his team to a 3–0 victory against a team considered to be a top three team by many. In the second round Haag was to come up against Strictly Business Gaming who they had hosted in a pre-LAN event, however Haag and his teammates won 3–2 and played Australian team Trident T1 Dotters for a guaranteed top three finish. OpTic Gaming led by Haag won the series 3–1 and guaranteed themselves 3rd and $120,000. OpTic were then to face CompLexity who were undefeated on Call of Duty: Ghosts and came up short in the winners bracket finals losing 3–2. OpTic then lost to Team EnVyUs in the losers bracket finals and Haag led his team to a top three finish and won his cut of $30,000.\nShortly after the Call of Duty World Championships, Haag signed an exclusivity contract with MLG to stream himself playing Call of Duty on MLG's MLG.tv web streaming service. On April 15, 2014, OpTic Gaming announced that Marcus 'MBoZe' Blanks would be leaving the team in order for Jordan 'ProoFy' Cannon to join the team. The OpTic Gaming roster (Haag's teammates) for UGC Niagara and for the 2014 season Call of Duty:Ghosts season was Seth 'Scumpii' Abner, James 'Clayster' Eubanks and Jordan 'ProoFy' Cannon.\nAt the new roster's first tournament together, a lackluster first day lead to them having to play the world's best team, and eventual winners of UGC Niagara, CompLexity Gaming, who proved too strong for Haag's team. They narrowly won every map to take a 3–0 series win and knock Haag and his OpTic Gaming team out of the tournament. Before and after UGC Niagara Haag competed with his team in the MLG Pro Circuit Season 2 in order to qualify for MLG Anaheim's pro team tournament to contest for a $70,000 prize pool. Haag's team qualified, being second place in the league.\nHaag and his OpTic Gaming team were invited to the MLG X Games on the Xbox One after finishing in the top 3 at the Call of Duty World Championships. They went into the event as underdogs after a disappointing tournament at UGC Niagara, however Haag and his team were able to win their group after beating Team EnVyUs and FaZe Red 3–1 to set up a semi final match against Evil Geniuses,(formerly known as CompLexity). Evil Geniuses were favorites to win the event after a dominant year at LAN events, but Haag and his three teammates were able to beat them 3–1 to face Team Kaliber in the Grand Finals. They managed to beat Team Kaliber in a match that came down to a Game 5, Round 10 in Search & Destroy, and Haag was able to win a gold medal and his first MLG Championship at the X Games in Austin, Texas.\nHaag was voted by fans as The Game Awards 2014 eSports Player of the Year. He took a trip out to Las Vegas with some of his teammates and sponsors to accept this award.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2014–15 season\nAdvanced Warfare will be the next installment in the Call Of Duty Franchise for the e-sports circuit. The season formally began November 2014. Haag was invited by Activision to Los Angeles for a preview of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in order to advise developers on the state of the game. On October 28, 2014, OpTic Gaming, led by Haag, participated in an exclusive Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare streaming event at the so-called 'OpTic House' in Chicago, in order to promote the new edition in the franchise for its creators, Sledgehammer Games.\nIn season opening competition, MLG Columbus, Haag and his team achieved second place, losing out to FaZe in the Grand Final. This was a sad loss for OpTic and Haag, as they hadn't dropped a map all day until the grand finals. OpTic looked like they were going to win it all until they ran into Faze Clan in the finals. Faze narrowly took the victory, going all the way to a second best of five series.\nThe second tournament Haag competed in with OpTic was at UMG Orlando. Haag and his team achieved first place this time around. They went 0–2 in the first day of competition but his team managed to bounce back and with their other two games in pool play on the second day of competition. On Championship Sunday OpTic were crowned victorious as they beat a young team known as Stunner Gaming 3–1 in the grand finals.\nTwelve teams qualified, including Haag's team, for Pro League Season 1: Prophecy, FaZe, Justus, Aware, Automatic Reload, EnVyUs, Denial, eLevate, Rise Nation, Team KaLiBeR, OpTic Nation, and OpTic Gaming. Haag's team now consists of Ian \"Crimsix\" Porter, Seth \"Scumpii\" Abner, and Matthew \"Formal\" Piper. OpTic Gaming were to go 38–6 in the MLG Season 1 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and qualified with the number one seed for the playoffs which they completed at with a $75,000 prize pool. OpTic Gaming went into the event led by NaDeSHoT and hoped to become the first team to win a LAN tournament without dropping a map. They went on to beat Rise Nation 3–0, they then came up against a team with young players called Aware Gaming who they beat 3–1 however this meant they did not become the first team to win an event without dropping a map. They then faced Team Kaliber in the winners bracket final who they narrowly beat 3–2 before progressing to the grand finals where they beat Denial eSports 3–0 to win their second event in a row. This was Haag's second win of an MLG event after winning previously at X Games during the Call of Duty: Ghosts season.\nOn April 4, 2015, NaDeSHoT announced that he was stepping down as captain and member of the OpTic Gaming pro-team. He said that he will become a full-time content creator as well as co-owner of the OpTic organization. He was replaced on the lineup by Damon \"Karma\" Barlow.\n\n100 Thieves\nIn 2016, Haag founded a lifestyle brand and gaming organization based in Los Angeles, California called 100 Thieves. The organization has teams competing in Apex Legends, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Marvel Rivals, and Valorant. 100 Thieves operates franchises in the League Championship Series (LCS), Valorant Americas League and Call of Duty League, where it is branded as the Los Angeles Thieves. The company was co-founded alongside Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. Drake bought ownership stake in 100 Thieves in 2018.\n\nPersonal life\nOn July 21, 2023, Haag married his long-time girlfriend Haley Hey. The Haags' first child, a daughter, was born in December 2023.\n\nBooks\nRodriguez, Hector; Haag, Matthew; Abner, Seth; Johnson, Will; Glassel, Ashley; Musselman, Ryan; Wyatt, Ryan (May 17, 2016).

        "content": "August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Its length is 31 days.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, August falls in summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, the month falls during winter. In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome.\nCertain meteor showers take place in August. The Kappa Cygnids occur in August, with yearly dates varying. The Alpha Capricornids meteor shower occurs as early as July 10 and ends around August 10. The Southern Delta Aquariids occur from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28–29. The Perseids, a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the peak days varying yearly. The star cluster of Messier 30 is best observed around August.\nAmong the aborigines of the Canary Islands, especially among the Guanches of Tenerife, the month of August received the name of Beñesmer or Beñesmen, which was also the harvest festival held that month.\nThe month was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the 6th month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, with March being the first month of the year. About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 46 BC (AUC 708), giving it its modern length of 31 days.\nIn 8 BC, the month was renamed in honor of Emperor Augustus. According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt. Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis had 31 days before it was renamed. It was not chosen for its length.\n\nSymbols\nAugust's birthstones are the peridot, sardonyx, and spinel. Its birth flower is the gladiolus or poppy, meaning beauty, strength of character, love, marriage and family. The Western zodiac signs are Leo (until August 22) and Virgo (from August 23 onward).\n\nObservances\nThis list does not necessarily imply official status or general observance.\n\nNon-Gregorian: 2025

        "content": "Nadia is a female name. Variations include Nadja, Nadya, Nadine, Nadiya, and Nadiia. Most variations of the name are derived from Arabic, Slavic languages, or both.\nIn many Slavic languages, names similar to Nadia mean \"hope\": Ukrainian Nadiya (Надія, accent on the i), Czech Naďa, Belarusian Nadzieja (Надзея, accent on the e), and Old Polish Nadzieja, all of which are derived from Proto-Slavic *naděja, the first three from Old East Slavic. In Bulgarian and Russian, on the other hand, Nadia or Nadya (Надя, accent on first syllable) is the diminutive form of the full name Nadezhda (Надежда), meaning \"hope\" and derived from Old Church Slavonic, which it entered as a translation of the Greek word ἐλπίς (Elpis), with the same meaning; in those languages, Nadia often is used as a full name in its own right.\nIn Arabic, the name is Nadiyyah, meaning \"tender\" and \"delicate.\" In the Dan language, the word Nãdienã simply  means \"girl\".\n\nPeople\nNotable people with the name Nadia include:\n\nAcademics\nNadia Abu El Haj (born 1962), assistant professor at Barnard College\nNadia E.

        "content": "Kayla Marie Sims (born August 14, 1999), also known by her YouTube handle lilsimsie, is an American YouTuber and Twitch streamer. Sims is best known for playing The Sims 4, her collaborations with EA on projects such as The Sims 4: Snowy Escape and The Sims 4: Growing Together, and her charity work for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nCareer\nYouTube\nSims started making YouTube videos about The Sims in 2015. Sims' most popular YouTube video, \"Building in The Sims but Each Room is a Different Budget\" has over 4 million views. As of May 2024, Sims has two million subscribers.\nSims is the creator of the Wolf Pack Challenge, which uses The Sims 4: Cats & Dogs expansion pack, and the Not So Berry Challenge, created with her friend Zoë (alwaysimming). In 2019, for her \"Simsie Save\", in which Sims renovates the game's worlds and characters, Sims made all toilets in her save gender-neutral. One of Sims' longest running YouTube series was the \"100 Baby Challenge\" series, in which she completed the 100 Baby Challenge in The Sims 4 over the course of five years.\nIn a July 2020 patch to The Sims 4, all cowplants in the game were given the default name \"Little Simzee\" as a nod to Sims' campaign for the ability to name cowplants in game. Part of this campaign included getting the #justiceforcowplants trending on the Sims gallery via a \"shell\" building challenge. In August 2020, Sims joined other Sims YouTubers in speaking out against the lack of diversity in skin tones in The Sims 4.\nSims was a judge on YouTube's gaming creator competition show, uTure. The show ended August 13, 2022.\n\nTwitch\nSims has a Twitch channel with 823,000 followers, and usually streamed six days per week. In 2018, Sims was nominated for Streamer of the Year at Summer in the City for her streaming on Twitch. In January 2021, an illustration of her cat was made the PogChamp emote on Twitch for a day.\nSims, as part of the team Sandy's Candies with streamers brandiganBTW, Fuzzireno, and TheHaboo, won the first Stardew Valley Cup in September 2021.\nIn May 2022, Sims revisited the subject of her most popular video, leaving her Sims 4 game unpaused all night, but this time on her Twitch stream instead of in a YouTube video.\n\nCharity streams\nIn May 2021, Sims participated for a second time, this time streaming every day for the entire month of May, and raised $369,000 for St. Jude Children's Hospital, bringing her total amount raised for that charity to over $500,000. In June 2021, Sims raised $15,000 for the Transgender Law Center during a charity stream. As a gamer herself, Sims is an avid supporter of AbleGamers, a charity dedicated to making games accessible to disabled children, and has raised money for them on multiple campaigns since 2020. In August 2021, Sims raised over $100,000 for AbleGamers to help Steven Spohn reach his birthday fundraising goal of $1,000,000.\nAs of 2024, Sims has raised over $2 million for St. Jude Children's Hospital through her annual month-long charity Twitch streams. On January 22, 2024, Sims raised money for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund through her Twitch account. She raised $52,000 in one day.\n\nOther work\nIn October 2020, Sims announced her collaboration with The Sims 4: Snowy Escape expansion pack, creating three lots for the game: 6–4–1 Hanamigawa, 5–6–1 Shinrinyoku, and 2–5–1 Wakabamori. In January 2023, Sims announced her collaboration with The Sims 4: Growing Together expansion pack, creating three lots for the game: Celebration Center, Sequoia Cottage, and 13 Acacia Avenue. She collaborated with the franchise again with The Sims 4: Comfy Gamer kit, released in 2025.\nSims also created content for TikTok. In January 2022, a TikTok she made explaining first-person mode in the Sims 4 and featuring a sim making a grilled cheese was removed for \"nudity and sexual activity.\" The TikTok was subsequently restored and has over 500,000 views.\n\nPersonal life\nSims lived in Chicago until her family moved to Florida when she was 4. She began playing The Sims when she was 12 and became particularly interested in the game after her father was diagnosed with cancer when she was 14. Sims has attributed the game with helping her cope with her father's diagnosis, using it as an “escape”. Sims graduated from the University of Central Florida in May 2020 with a bachelor's degree in history.\nSims married fellow streamer Dan Grenander on August 25, 2021. Previously, Grenander had moved to the United States to live with her in July 2021 on a K-1 fiancé visa, after living in the United Kingdom. They applied for the visa in February 2020. Grenander streams on Twitch under the name “duckdan” and uploads to his associated YouTube channel under the same name. Grenander often plays games such as Dead by Daylight, Fall Guys and Minecraft. They often play games together, such as Mario Kart, Among Us and Fall Guys. They live in Oviedo, Florida.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinah",
        "content": "In the Book of Genesis, Dinah (; Hebrew: דִּינָה, Modern: Dīna, Tiberian: Dīnā, 'judged'; 'vindicated') was the seventh child and only daughter of Leah and Jacob. The episode of her rape by Shechem, son of a Canaanite or Hivite prince, and the subsequent vengeance of her brothers Simeon and Levi, commonly referred to as the rape of Dinah, is told in Genesis 34.\n\nIn Genesis\nDinah is first mentioned in Genesis 30:21 as the daughter of Leah and Jacob, born to Leah after she bore six sons to Jacob. In Genesis 34, Dinah went out to visit the women of Shechem, where her people had made camp and where her father Jacob had purchased the land where he had pitched his tent. Shechem (son of Hamor, the prince of the land) then took her and raped her, but how this text is to be exactly translated and understood is the subject of scholarly controversy.\n\nShechem asked his father to obtain Dinah for him, to be his wife. Hamor came to Jacob and asked for Dinah for his son: \"Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. You shall dwell with us; and the land shall be open to you.\" Shechem offered Jacob and his sons any bride-price they named. But \"the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah\"; they said they would accept the offer if the men of the city agreed to be circumcised.\nSo the men of Shechem were deceived, and were circumcised; and \"on the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob and Leah, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males. They slew Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.\" And the sons of Jacob plundered whatever was in the city and in the field, \"all their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses\".\n\"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.' But they said, 'Should he treat our sister as a harlot?'\" (Genesis 34:31).\n\nLast mention of Dinah in the Bible\nWhen Jacob's family prepares to descend to Egypt, Genesis lists the 70 family members who went down together (Genesis 46:8–27). Dinah is specifically listed, in verse 15 (\"These are the sons of Leah, that she bore to Jacob in Padan Aram, and Dinah his daughter.\"). Dovid Rosenfeld states that \"That is it. The Torah does not tell us anything about what happened to her for the remainder of her life, nor if she ever married and raised a family\".\n\nOrigin of Genesis 34\nChapter 34 of the Book of Genesis deals primarily with the family of Abraham and his descendants, including Dinah, her father Jacob, and her brothers. The traditional view is that Moses wrote Genesis as well as almost all the rest of the Torah, doubtlessly using varied sources but synthesizing all of them together to give the Hebrews a written history of their ancestors. This view—which has been held for the past several thousand years, although it is not explicitly mentioned in either the Hebrew or the Christian Bible—holds that Moses included this story primarily because it happened and he viewed it as significant. It foreshadows later happenings and prophecies further along in Genesis and the Torah dealing with the two violent brothers.\nSource-critical scholars speculate that Genesis combines separate literary strands, with different values and concerns, and does not pre-date the 1st millennium BC as a unified account. Within Genesis 34 itself, they suggest two layers of narrative: an older account ascribing the killing of Shechem to Simeon and Levi alone, and a later addition (verses 27 to 29) involving all the sons of Jacob. Kirsch argues that the narrative combines a Yahwist narrator describing a rape, and an Elohist speaker describing a seduction.\nOn the other hand, another critical scholar, Alexander Rofé, assumes that the earlier authors would not have considered rape to be defilement in and of itself, and posits that the verb describing Dinah as \"defiled\" was added later (elsewhere in the Bible, only married or betrothed women are \"defiled\" by rape). He instead says that such a description reflected a \"late, post-exilic notion that the idolatrous gentiles are impure [and supports] the prohibition of intermarriage and intercourse with them.\" Such a supposed preoccupation with ethnic purity must therefore indicate a late date for Genesis in the 5th or 4th centuries BC, when the restored Jewish community in Jerusalem was similarly preoccupied with anti-Samaritan polemics. In Rofé's analysis, the \"defilement\" refers to interracial sex rather than rape.\n\nIn rabbinic literature\nMidrashic literature contains a series of proposed explanations of the Bible by rabbis. It provides further hypotheses of the story of Dinah, suggesting answers to questions such as her offspring: Osnat a daughter from Shechem, and links to later incidents and characters.\nOne midrash states that Dinah was conceived as a male in Leah's womb but miraculously changed to a female, lest the maid-servants (Bilhah and Zilpah) be associated with more of the Israelite tribes than Rachel.\nAnother midrash implicates Jacob in Dinah's misfortune: when he went to meet Esau, he locked Dinah in a box, for fear that Esau would wish to marry her, but God rebuked him in these words: \"If thou hadst married off thy daughter in time she would not have been tempted to sin, and might, moreover, have exerted a beneficial influence upon her husband\". Her brother Simeon promised to find a husband for her, but she did not wish to leave Shechem, fearing that, after her disgrace, no one would take her to wife. However, she was later married to Job. When she died, Simeon buried her in the land of Canaan. She is therefore referred to as \"the Canaanitish woman\" (Genesis 46:10). Joseph's wife Asenath (ib.) was her daughter by Shechem.\nEarly Christian commentators such as Jerome likewise assign some of the responsibility to Dinah, in venturing out to visit the women of Shechem. This story was used to demonstrate the danger to women in the public sphere as contrasted with the relative security of remaining in private.\n\nSimeon and Levi\nOn his deathbed, their father Jacob curses Simeon and Levi's \"anger\" (Genesis 49). Their tribal portions in the land of Israel are dispersed so that they would not be able to regroup and fight arbitrarily. According to the Midrash, Simeon and Levi were only 14 and 13 years old, respectively, at the time of the rape of Dinah. They possessed great moral zealousness (later, in the episode of the Golden Calf, the Tribe of Levi would demonstrate their absolute commitment to Moses' leadership by killing all the people involved in idol worship), but their anger was misdirected here.\n\nOne midrash told how Jacob later tried to restrain their hot tempers by dividing their portions in the land of Israel, and neither had lands of their own. Therefore, Dinah's son by Shechem was counted among Simeon's progeny and received a portion of land in Israel, Dinah herself being \"the Canaanite woman\" mentioned among those who went down into Egypt with Jacob and his sons (Genesis 46:10). When she died, Simeon buried her in the land of Canaan. (According to another tradition, her child from her rape by Shechem was Asenath, the wife of Joseph, and she herself later married the prophet Job.) The Tribe of Simeon received land within the territory of Judah and served as itinerant teachers in Israel, traveling from place to place to earn a living.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the tribe of Levi received a few Cities of Refuge spread out over Israel, and relied for their sustenance on the priestly gifts that the Children of Israel gave them.\nIn medieval rabbinic literature, there were efforts to justify the killing, not merely of Shechem and Hamor, but of all the townsmen. Maimonides argued that the killing was understandable because the townsmen had failed to uphold the seventh Noachide law (denim) to establish a criminal justice system. However, Nachmanides disagreed, partly because he viewed the seventh law as a positive commandment that was not punishable by death. Instead, Nachmanides said that the townsmen presumably violated other Noachide laws, such as idolatry or sexual immorality. Later, the Maharal reframed the issue—not as sin, but rather as a war. That is, he argued that Simeon and Levi acted lawfully insofar as they carried out a military operation as an act of vengeance or retribution for the rape of Dinah.\n\nTravel to Egypt\nThe Torah lists the 70 members of Jacob's family who went down together into Egypt (Genesis 46:8–27). Simeon's children include \"Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman\" (verse 10). The medieval French rabbi Rashi hypothesized that this Shaul was Dinah's son by Shechem. He suggests that after the brothers killed all the men in the city, including Shechem and his father, Dinah refused to leave the palace unless Simeon agreed to marry her and remove her shame (according to Nachmanides, she only lived in his house and did not have sex with him). Therefore, Shaul is counted among Simeon's progeny, and he received a portion of land in Israel in the time of Joshua. The list of the names of the families of Israel in Egypt is repeated in Exodus 6:14–25 (including \"Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman\", verse 15).\n\nIn apocryphical literature\nIn the apocryphal book Testament of Job, Dinah is said to have been Job's second wife after the death of his first wife, who is referred to as \"Sitidos\".\n\nIn culture\nSymbol of black womanhood\nIn 19th-century America, \"Dinah\" became a generic name for an enslaved African woman. At the 1850 Woman's Rights Convention in New York, a speech by Sojourner Truth was reported on in the New York Herald, which used the name \"Dinah\" to symbolize black womanhood as represented by Truth:\n\nIn a convention where sex and color are mingled together in the common rights of humanity, Dinah, and Burleigh, and Lucretia, and Frederick Douglas [sic], are all spiritually of one color and one sex, and all on a perfect footing of reciprocity. Most assuredly, Dinah was well posted up on the rights of woman, and with something of the ardor and the odor of her native Africa, she contended for her right to vote, to hold office, to practice medicine and the law, and to wear the breeches with the best white man that walks upon God's earth.\nLizzie McCloud, a slave on a Tennessee plantation during the American Civil War, recalled that Union soldiers called all enslaved women \"Dinah\". Describing her fear when the Union army arrived, she said: \"We was so scared we run under the house and the Yankees called 'Come out Dinah' (didn't call none of us anything but Dinah). They said 'Dinah, we're fightin' to free you and get you out from under bondage'.\" After the end of the war in 1865 The New York Times exhorted the newly liberated slaves to demonstrate that they had the moral values to use their freedom effectively, using the names \"Sambo\" and \"Dinah\" to represent male and female former slaves: \"You are free Sambo, but you must work. Be virtuous too, oh Dinah!\"\nThe name Dinah was subsequently used for dolls and other images of black women.\n\nIn literature\nThe novel The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is a fictional autobiography of the biblical Dinah. In Diamant's version, Dinah falls in love with Shalem, the Canaanite prince, and goes to bed with him in preparation for marriage. Simeon and Levi, Jacob's sons, instigate the discord between Jacob and the men of the King of Shechem out of fear for their own prosperity, even though Dinah tells them the truth.\nA fictionalized account of Dinah's life is included as one of the stories in the short story collection Sarah and After by Lynne Reid Banks.\n\nSee also\nRape in the Hebrew Bible\n\nNotes\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Singer, Isidore; et al., eds.

She was created by a computer programmer and AI developer named Vedal, who had the idea of an AI VTuber by combining a large language model with a computer-animated avatar. Her avatars; or models, are designed by the VTuber “annytf”. She debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022. As of January 2025, Neuro-sama is the 7th most-subscribed channel on Twitch of all time.\n\nDevelopment\nNeuro-sama was created by a developer named Vedal, with the username \"vedal987\". Her responses are generated by a large language model, which are converted into a high-pitched, childlike voice using a text-to-speech application. According to Vedal, a separate AI model controls her in-game actions when she plays video games. In a 2023 interview with Bloomberg News, he said that Neuro-sama was his full-time job.\nThe first iteration of Neuro-sama was created in May 2019 as a neural network trained to play the rhythm game osu!. Three years later, Neuro-sama would re-debut on Twitch, after a long hiatus, on 19 December 2022, now a chatbot with a Live2D model. She received a new model on 27 May 2023.\n\nHistory\n2022\nNeuro streamed every day after her debut. She grew rapidly in popularity, from a maximum concurrent viewership of 516 on 19 December to 3,393 on 31 December, and going from a Twitch follower count of 2,825 to around 40,000 in the same time period. Nearly all of her streaming content in 2022 was of the rhythm game osu!, with one Minecraft stream. On 28 December, she defeated osu! champion mrekk 10–5 in a 1v1 contest.\n\n2023\nOn 3 January, Neuro-sama reached 50,000 Twitch followers. The next day, on 4 January, Neuro-sama sang for the first time on stream, performing \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd.\nOn 11 January, the Twitch channel received a temporary ban for unspecified \"hateful conduct\", likely stemming from controversial statements made by the AI, including skepticism surrounding the validity of the Holocaust during a stream. Vedal added more words to her chat filter to prevent Neuro-sama from making offensive statements after this occurred. The channel was unbanned on 25 January 2023 and surpassed 100,000 followers the same day. On 25 January, Neuro-sama returned to Twitch with a stream in which she played Pokémon Showdown! Gen 4 random battles against viewers.\nOn 20 February, Neuro-sama reached 200,000 Twitch followers. It was announced during a stream with VTuber Onigiri. Neuro-sama responded: \"Yeah. That's amazing. I'm happy I have that many people following me. I hope I keep them entertained with my streams and content for as long as possible, and I hope I get to meet more of you in the future, so thank you for following me everybody, and please add more of my followers, because I love all of you so much. Thank you so much. Heart heart.\"\nOn 25 March, a new character acting as an Evil Neuro-sama to Neuro-sama was introduced on vedal987's channel due to popular request for Neuro-sama to collaboration with a copy of herself. She was later named Evil Neuro and became a recurring character.\nOn 15 April, Neuro-sama held a stream with Hololive member Takanashi Kiara, during which they rated the contents of viewers' refrigerators. The stream reached a peak of over 19,000 viewers on Kiara's channel and over 10,000 on Neuro-sama's. It was the first collaboration between Neuro-sama and a member of a major agency. She also reached 300,000 Twitch followers.\nOn 27 May, Neuro-sama held an official debut stream to reveal her first original Live2D model. She had previously used a sample model provided for free by Live2D. According to TwitchTracker, the stream reached a peak of 25,687 concurrent viewers, beating the channel's previous record by more than double. On 30 May, Neuro-sama was announced to be participating in OffKai Expo 2023, held from 16–18 June, marking her first fan convention appearance. On 14 June, Neuro-sama held her first sponsored stream in the form of a watchalong commentating on the debut stream of a talent from VTuber group idolEN.\nOn 1 September, Neuro-sama reached 400,000 Twitch followers. On 16 December, vedal987 received an award for Best Tech VTuber at the 2023 VTuber Awards. On 19 December, Neuro-sama held her first subathon alongside her first anniversary of streaming on Twitch. During the subathon, Neuro-sama achieved the status of most watched VTuber across all major livestreaming platforms, and most watched female streamer on Twitch for the fourth week of December according to Streams Charts.\n\n2024\nOn 4 January, Neuro-sama ended her subathon after 17 days of continuous livestreaming, garnering a total of 41,767 Twitch subscriptions, and 2.43 million collective watch hours. Later that month on 28 January, Neuro-sama reached 500,000 Twitch followers.\nOn 18 March, following a two-and-a-half-month break after Neuro-sama's subathon that ended in early January, she returned to streaming to a peak audience of 15,000 viewers with a Shrek watchalong. On 31 March, Neuro-sama made a physical appearance at WeebCon 2024. During the event, her avatar was displayed on a tablet, and she was carried around the venue by fellow VTubers Camila and Rainhoe to interact live with fans.\nOn 19 May, Neuro-sama's sister Evil Neuro completed her first full run of Slay the Spire using her adaptive gameplay AI. On 25 May, Neuro-sama participated in independent VTuber Dokibird's 2024 Wrestletuber event, combining indie VTubers and corporate VTubers across several VTuber agencies, including Hololive, VShojo, and idol Corp. The event was hosted on WWE 2K24 in which the VTuber's custom player models compete in a zero-player game style tournament. In this event, Neuro-sama's model fought and won in a show-match against VShojo's Zentreya. Altogether, a total of 35 individual VTubers participating in some fashion either as contestants or commentators. On 31 May, Neuro-sama debuted a new model of herself depicted as a loaf of bread. She would then appear in this model at OffKai Expo 2024 on a livestream with Filian and her creator Vedal. This model was then killed off in a later Subnautica stream due to her model being kayfabed by Vedal when he \"exposed\" her to water and \"disintegrated\" the bread model.\nOn 17 June, Neuro-sama's YouTube channel reached 300,000 subscribers. On 20 July, Neuro-sama began streaming with Japanese subtitles on a separate Twitch channel in response to an influx of Japanese interest after a tweet of Neuro-sama singing Dubidubidu by X (formerly Twitter) Japanese user 蒼(sora) gained virality, garnering 7.6 million views.\nOn 15 September, Neuro-sama's reached 600,000 Twitch followers. Additionally, both Neuro-sama and Evil Neuro participated in the Bilibili Ice & Fire Music Festival 2024 that featured 42 of the most popular Bilibili VTubers, the duo sang \"Ordinary DISCO\" by Vocaloid producer ilemonyk. This comes after Neuro-sama's success in branching out to the Chinese market with her debut on the Bilibili platform back in August 2024; this is in part due to her pre-existing Chinese fans from extensive fansubbing of her Twitch livestreams and due to her unique nature as an AI VTuber; her Bilibili channel grew explosively, even surpassing her Twitch follower count with 700,000+ followers as of January 2025.\nOn 11 November, Neuro-sama and Evil Neuro played against Twitch Streamer DougDoug; and his twitch chat, in a Geoguessr tournament, which she won.\nOn 19 December, Neuro-sama held her second annual subathon, complete with a debut of a new Live2D model, a new original music video named LIFE, her own dedicated merch store page, with an internet-connected lava lamp being a key highlight.\n\n2025\nOn 1 January, Neuro-sama broke the world record for the highest level of a Twitch hype train during her subathon, reaching level 111 and surpassing the former record holder, Pirate Software, who reached level 106. Over the course of three hours, she amassed nearly 85,000 subscribers and 1.2 million bits to get to that level.\nOn 16 January, at 10:56 PM (UTC), Neuro-Sama's 2nd Anniversary Birthday Subathon ended with a recap video.\nIt lasted for a total of 28 days with all subscription goals achieved and amassing over 7 million collective watch hours. 166,911 subs and 3,183,212 Twitch bits were gifted in total. The subathon makes Neuro-sama the 7th most-subscribed channel on Twitch of all time.\n\nOnline content\nNeuro-sama's Twitch content primarily centers around playing video games, notably osu! (2007), in which her gameplay once defeated the best-ranking human player in the world, and Minecraft (2011), in which her adaptations to sandbox gameplay have gained notoriety. Other aspects of her content delivery include singing songs, playing chess with her viewers, chatting with other VTubers during collaborations and reacting to YouTube videos. While playing games or participating in other activities, the AI frequently engages with viewers by responding to their questions and acknowledging donations. Her comedic and sometimes controversial responses to the live chat have gone viral, accelerating the rise in popularity. Her fanbase has dubbed itself \"The Swarm\".\n\nDiscography\nAs lead artist\nAs featured artist\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nai_sponge, a Twitch and YouTube channel that used artificial intelligence (AI) to generate livestream content featuring characters from the animated SpongeBob SquarePants\nNothing, Forever, a 24/7 procedurally generated animated sitcom parodying Seinfeld that was launched on Twitch on 14 December 2022, five days before Neuro-sama\nTay, a chatbot taken offline for denying the Holocaust\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nOfficial Twitch Channel\nOfficial YouTube Channel\n\n\n== References ==",

        "streamer": "TOMATO",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato",
        "content": "The tomato (US: , UK: ), Solanum lycopersicum, is a plant whose fruit is an edible berry that is eaten as a vegetable. The tomato is a member of the nightshade family that includes tobacco, potato, and chili peppers. It originated from and was domesticated in western South America. It was introduced to the Old World by the Spanish in the Columbian exchange in the 16th century.\nTomato plants are vines, largely annual and vulnerable to frost, though sometimes living longer in greenhouses. The flowers are able to self-fertilise. Modern varieties have been bred to ripen uniformly red, in  a process that has impaired the fruit's sweetness and flavor. There are thousands of cultivars, varying in size, color, shape, and flavor. Tomatoes are attacked by many insect pests and nematodes, and are subject to diseases caused by viruses and by mildew and blight fungi.\nThe tomato has a strong savoury umami flavor, and is an important ingredient in cuisines around the world. It is used in pizzas, pasta and other sauces, soups such as gazpacho, curries including dhansak and rogan josh, as juice, and in Bloody Mary cocktails. Tomato festivals are held annually in Buñol, Spain, in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, and in Närpes, Finland.\n\nNaming\nEtymology\nThe word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl [ˈtomat͡ɬ] . The specific name lycopersicum, meaning 'wolf peach', originated with Galen, who used it to denote a plant that has never been identified. Luigi Anguillara speculated in the 16th century that Galen's lycopersicum might be the tomato, and despite the impossibility of this identification, lycopersicum entered scientific use as a name for the fruit.\n\nPronunciation\nThe usual pronunciations of tomato are   (in North American English) and  (in British English). The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" (\"You like  and I like  / You like  and I like \").\n\nHistory\nThe likely wild ancestor of the tomato, the red-fruited Solanum pimpinellifolium, is native to western South America, where it was probably first domesticated. The resulting domesticated plant, ancestral to the modern large-fruited tomato varieties, was probably the cherry tomato, S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme. However, genomic analysis suggests that the domestication process may have been more complex than this. S. lycopersicon var. cerasiforme may have existed before domestication, while traits supposedly typical of domestication may have been reduced in that variety and then reselected (in a case of convergent evolution) in the cultivated tomato. The analysis predicts that var. cerasiforme appeared around 78,000 years ago, while the cultivated tomato originated around 7,000 years ago (5,000 BCE), with substantial uncertainty, making it unclear how humans may have been involved in the process.\nThe Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish food. Elsewhere in Europe, its first use was ornamental, not least because it was understood to be related to the nightshades and assumed to be poisonous.\n\nMesoamerica\nThe exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BC, it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas. The Pueblo people believed that tomato seeds could confer powers of divination. The large, lumpy variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.\nThe Aztecs raised several varieties of tomato, with red tomatoes called xitomatl and green tomatoes (physalis) called tomatl (tomatillo). Bernardino de Sahagún reported seeing a great variety of tomatoes in the Aztec market at Tenochtitlán (Mexico City): \"large tomatoes, small tomatoes, leaf tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, large serpent tomatoes, nipple-shaped tomatoes\", and tomatoes of all colors from the brightest red to the deepest yellow. Sahagún mentioned Aztecs cooking various sauces, some with tomatoes of different sizes, serving them in city markets: \"foods sauces, hot sauces; ... with tomatoes, ... sauce of large tomatoes, sauce of ordinary tomatoes, ...\"\n\nSpanish distribution\nThe Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés's capture of Tenochtitlan in 1521 initiated the widespread cultural and biological interchange called the Columbian exchange; certainly the tomato was being grown in Europe within a few years of that event. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in Pietro Andrea Mattioli's 1544 herbal. He suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy. He stated that it was blood red or golden color when mature, and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant—that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oil. Ten years later Mattioli named the fruits in print as pomi d'oro, or \"golden apples\".\nAfter the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean. They brought it to the Philippines, from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the whole of Asia. \nThe Spanish brought the tomato to Europe, where it grew easily in Mediterranean climates; cultivation began in the 1540s. It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain, as documented in the 1618 play La octava maravilla by Lope de Vega with \"lovelier than ... a tomato in season\".\n\nChina\nThe tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 16th century. It was given the name 番茄 fānqié (foreign eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad, but referring specifically to early introductions.\n\nItaly\nIn 1548, the house steward of Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo \"had arrived safely\". Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. The tomato's ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy. However, in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing close to the ground suggested low status. They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other crops. Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties. In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century. The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.\nVarieties were developed over the following centuries for drying, for sauce, for pizzas, and for long-term storage. These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name. For example, there is the Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, the \"hanging tomato of Vesuvius\", and the well known and highly prized San Marzano tomato grown in that region, with a European protected designation of origin certification.\n\nBritain\nTomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s. One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon. Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources, is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England. Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous. Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating for many years in Britain and its North American colonies. By 1820, tomatoes were described as \"to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets\" and to be \"used by all our best cooks\", reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still \"for the singularity of their appearance\", while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine. For example, in Elizabeth Blackwell's A Curious Herbal, it is described under the name \"Love Apple (Amoris Pomum)\" as being consumed with oil and vinegar in Italy, similar to consumption of cucumbers in the UK. In 1963, The New York Times gave an explanation of the name 'Love Apple' as a French misreading of the Italian pomo dei Mori (\"the Moors' apple\") as pomme d'amour, (\"apple of love\").\n\nMiddle East\nThe tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in Aleppo c. 1799 to 1825. Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish. In 1881, it is described as only eaten in the region \"within the last forty years\".\n\nUnited States\nThe earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from 1710, when herbalist William Salmon saw them in what is today South Carolina, perhaps introduced from the Caribbean. By the mid-18th century, they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations, and probably in other parts of the Southeast. Thomas Jefferson, who ate tomatoes in Paris, sent some seeds back to America. Some early American advocates of the culinary use of the tomato included Michele Felice Cornè and Robert Gibbon Johnson. Many Americans considered tomatoes to be poisonous at this time and, in general, they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food. In 1897, W. H. Garrison stated, \"The belief was once transmitted that the tomato was sinisterly dangerous.\" He recalled in his youth tomatoes were dubbed \"love-apples or wolf-apples\" and shunned as \"globes of the devil\".\nWhen Alexander W. Livingston (1821–1898) began developing the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size, and sweet in flavor. He eventually developed over seventeen varieties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1937 yearbook declared that \"half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato.\" Livingston's first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870. In 1875, he introduced the Acme, said to be in the parentage of most cultivars for the next twenty-five years. Other early breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr. Hand in Baltimore.\nBecause of the tomato's need for heat and a long growing season, several states in the Sun Belt became major producers, particularly Florida and California. In California, tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh market and for canning and processing. The University of California, Davis's C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center maintains a gene bank of wild relatives, monogenic mutants and genetic stocks.  Research on processing tomatoes is also conducted by the California Tomato Research Institute in Escalon, California. In California, growers have used a method of cultivation called dry-farming, especially with Early Girl tomatoes. This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture.\n\nBotany\nDescription\nTomato plants are vines, becoming decumbent, and can grow up to 3 m (9.8 ft); bush varieties are generally no more than 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) tall. They are tender perennials, often grown as annuals.\nTomato plants are dicots. They grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing. When the tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into new, fully functional, vines.\nTomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs. The hairs facilitate the vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture, especially if the vine's connection to its original root has been damaged or severed.\nThe leaves are 10–25 cm (4–10 in) long, odd pinnate, with five to nine leaflets on petioles, each leaflet up to 8 cm (3 in) long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely glandular-hairy.\nTomato flowers are bisexual and are able to self fertilize. As tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional pollinators (probably a species of halictid bee) did not move with them. The trait of self-fertility became an advantage, and domestic cultivars of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait. This is not the same as self-pollination, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so. That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations, where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants, or by cultured bumblebees.\nThe flowers develop on the apical meristem. They have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style. The anthers bend into a cone-like structure, surrounding the stigma. The flowers are 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme of three to twelve together.\nThe fruit develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh comprising the pericarp walls. The fruit contains locules, hollow spaces full of seeds. These vary among cultivated varieties. Some smaller varieties have two locules; globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five; beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of small locules; and plum tomatoes have very few, very small locules.\nFor propagation, the seeds need to come from a mature fruit, and must be lightly fermented to remove the gelatinous outer coating and then dried before use.\nThe tomato has a mutualistic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi such as Rhizophagus irregularis. Scientists use the tomato as a model species for investigating such symbioses.\n\nPhylogeny\nLike the potato, tomatoes belong to the genus Solanum, which is a member of the nightshade family, the Solanaceae. That is a diverse family of flowering plants, often poisonous, that includes the mandrake (Mandragora), deadly nightshade (Atropa), and tobacco (Nicotiana), as shown in the outline phylogenetic tree (many branches omitted).\n\nTaxonomy\nIn 1753, Linnaeus placed the tomato in the genus Solanum (alongside the potato) as Solanum lycopersicum. In 1768, Philip Miller moved it to its own genus, naming it Lycopersicon esculentum. The name came into wide use, but was technically in breach of the plant naming rules because Linnaeus's species name lycopersicum still had priority. Although the name Lycopersicum lycopersicum was suggested by Karsten (1888), it is not used because it violates the International Code of Nomenclature barring the use of tautonyms in botanical nomenclature. The corrected name Lycopersicon lycopersicum (Nicolson 1974) was technically valid, because Miller's genus name and Linnaeus's species name differ in exact spelling. As Lycopersicon esculentum has become so well known, it was officially listed as a nomen conservandum in 1983, and would be the correct name for the tomato in classifications which do not place the tomato in the genus Solanum.\nGenetic evidence shows that Linnaeus was correct to put the tomato in the genus Solanum, making S. lycopersicum the correct name. Both names, however, will probably be found in the literature for some time. Two of the major reasons for considering the genera separate are the leaf structure (tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum), and the biochemistry (many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent from the tomato). On the other hand, hybrids of tomato and diploid potato can be created in the lab by somatic fusion, and are partially fertile, providing evidence of the close relationship between these species.\n\nPlant breeding\nGenetics\nAn international consortium of researchers from 10 countries began sequencing the tomato genome in 2004. A prerelease version of the genome was made available in December 2009. The complete genome for the cultivar Heinz 1706 was published on 31 May 2012 in Nature. The latest reference genome published in 2021 had 799 MB and encodes 34,384 (predicted) proteins, spread over 12 chromosomes.\nThe first commercially available genetically modified food was a tomato called Flavr Savr, which was engineered to have a longer shelf life. It could be vine ripened without compromising shelf life. However, the product was not commercially successful, and was sold only until 1997.\n\nBreeding of modern commercial varieties\nThe poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red. This change occurred after discovery of a mutant \"u\" phenotype in the mid-20th century, so named because the fruits ripened uniformly. This was widely cross-bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on un-crossbred varieties. Before this, most tomatoes produced more sugar during ripening, and were sweeter and more flavorful.\n10–20% of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype. The u mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit, making them a lighter green, and reducing sugar in the resulting ripe fruit by 10–15%. Perhaps more importantly, the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll-free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate the carotenoids lycopene, β-carotene, and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit. The potent chloroplasts in the dark-green shoulders of the \"U\" phenotype are beneficial here, but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit, and even cracked yellow shoulders. This is apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures. Hence, genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types \"u\" and \"U\" requires fine tuning, but may be feasible.\nBreeders strive to produce tomato plants with improved yield, shelf life, size, and resistance to environmental pressures, including disease. These efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various fruit attributes. For instance, linkage drag, the introduction of an undesired trait during backcrossing, has altered the metabolism of the fruit. This trait is physically close to the desired allele along the chromosome. Breeding for traits like larger fruit has thus unintentionally altered nutritional value and flavor.\nBreeders have turned to wild tomato species as a source of alleles to introduce beneficial traits into modern varieties. For example, wild relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (associated with greater sugar content), or resistance to diseases such as to the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani. However, this tactic has limitations, since selection for traits such as pathogen resistance can negatively impact other favorable traits such as fruit production.\n\nCultivation\nThe tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars.\n\nHydroponic and greenhouse cultivation\nGreenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is increasing, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available. Smaller fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers. Tomatoes are also grown using hydroponics.\n\nPicking and ripening\nTo facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with the plant hormone ethylene.\nAt industrial scale, such as for canning, tomatoes are picked mechanically. The machine cuts the whole vine and uses sensors to separate ripe tomatoes from the rest of the plant, which is returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock.\n\nProduction\nIn 2022, world production of tomatoes was 186 million tonnes, with China accounting for 37% of the total, followed by India, Turkey, and the United States as major producers (table). The world dedicated 4.8 million hectares in 2012 for tomato cultivation and the total production was about 161.8 million tonnes. The average world farm yield for tomato was 33.6 tonnes per hectare in 2012. Tomato farms in the Netherlands were the most productive in 2012, with a nationwide average of 476 tonnes per hectare, followed by Belgium (463 tonnes per hectare) and Iceland (429 tonnes per hectare).\n\nPests and diseases\nPests\nCommon tomato pests include the tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs, and Colorado potato beetles. The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.\nAfter an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone. This activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects. The hormone was first identified in tomatoes.\n\nDiseases\nTomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants. A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus. Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants.\nA serious disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle. As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally.\nBacterial wilt is another common disease impacting yield. Wang et al., 2019 found phage combination therapies to reduce the impact of bacterial wilt, sometimes by reducing bacterial abundance and sometimes by selecting for resistant but slow growing genetics.\n\nAs food\nCulinary\nTomatoes, with their umami flavor, are extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine as a key ingredient in pizza and many pasta sauces. Tomatoes are used in Spanish gazpacho and Catalan pa amb tomàquet. The tomato is a crucial and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine, served fresh in salads (e.g., Arab salad, Israeli salad, Shirazi salad and Turkish salad), grilled with kebabs and other dishes, made into sauces, and so on.\nTomatoes were gradually incorporated into Indian curry dishes after Europeans introduced them. A Kashmiri curry, rogan josh, often contains tomato; it may originally have been colored red with chili pepper, and tomatoes may characterize the Punjabi version of the dish. The modern British curry tikka masala often has a tomato and cream sauce.\n\nStorage\nTomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight, rather than in a refrigerator. Storing stem down can prolong shelf life. Unripe tomatoes can be kept in a paper bag to ripen. Tomatoes can be preserved by canning, freezing, drying, or cooking down to a paste or puree.\n\nNutrition\nA raw tomato is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), raw tomatoes supply 18 calories and 16% of the Daily Value of vitamin C, but otherwise have low micronutrient content (table).\n\nEffects on health\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has determined there is little credible evidence that tomatoes or tomato-based foods reduce the risk of various types of cancer.\nIn a 2011 scientific review, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that lycopene did not favorably influence DNA, skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation, heart function or vision.\n\nToxins\nThe leaves, stem, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine. They contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in larger amounts in potato leaves and other members of the nightshade family. Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material.\nSmall amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring, and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes.\n\nSalmonella outbreaks\nTomatoes have been linked to multiple Salmonella food poisoning outbreaks in the US. One in 2008 caused the temporary removal of tomatoes from stores and restaurants across the United States and parts of Canada. In 2022 and 2023, an outbreak of Salmonella Senftenberg ST14 affected the US and 12 countries in Europe.\n\nIn popular culture\nCelebrations\nA massive \"tomato tree\" in the Walt Disney World Resort's experimental greenhouses in Lake Buena Vista, Florida may have been the largest single tomato plant. It yielded a harvest of more than 32,000 tomatoes, together weighing 522 kg (1,151 lb).\nThe town of Buñol, Spain, annually celebrates La Tomatina, a festival centered on an enormous tomato fight. On 30 August 2007, as many as 40,000 Spaniards gathered to throw 115,000 kg (254,000 lb) of tomatoes at each other in the festival.\nSome US states have adopted the tomato as a state fruit or vegetable. Arkansas took both sides by declaring the South Arkansas Vine Ripe Pink Tomato both the state fruit and the state vegetable in the same law, citing both its culinary and botanical classifications. In 2009, the state of Ohio passed a law making the tomato the state's official fruit, while tomato juice has been the state's official beverage since 1965.\nLivingston's plant breeding is commemorated in his home town of Reynoldsburg with an annual Tomato Festival; it calls itself \"The Birthplace of the Tomato\". In Finland, the Tomatkarnevalen is held annually in the town of Närpes.\nTomatoes are sometimes thrown in public protests. Embracing it for this connotation, the Dutch Socialist party adopted the tomato as their logo. The same meaning is evoked in the name of the American review-aggregation website for film and television, \"Rotten Tomatoes\", though its founder mentions a scene in the 1992 movie Leolo as the immediate source of the name.\n\nFruit or vegetable\nAlthough the tomato is cooked and eaten as a vegetable, botanically, a tomato is a fruit, specifically a berry, consisting of the ovary, together with its seeds, of a flowering plant. The issue has led to legal dispute in the United States. In 1887, U.S. tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruit, caused the tomato's status to become a matter of legal importance. In Nix v. Hedden, the U.S. Supreme Court settled the controversy on 10 May 1893, by declaring that for the purposes of the Tariff of 1883 only, the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use—they are generally served with dinner and not dessert.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nSources\nCollingham, Lizzie (2006) [2005 (Chatto & Windus)].

Notable guests that have appeared on the shows include James Charles, Pokimane, Mia Malkova, and Lil Nas X.\nDue to the live, unscripted nature of Austin's broadcasts, a number of controversial incidents have occurred during the shows. In March 2018, the streamer Aqualadora admitted to intentionally killing a dog after Austin asked her to reveal the worst thing she had ever done.\n\n2020–2021: Persona change and collaboration\nIn March 2020, Twitch banned streamer Kaceytron after she made insensitive comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic during one of Austin's broadcasts.\nOn June 12, 2020, Austin announced that he would be dropping the RajjPatel moniker entirely, after dropping the Patel last name from his persona in late 2019. The name had generated controversy in the past due to his portrayal of Indian people as a white man. In a statement released on Twitter, he stated, \"I don't want any part of my image, name, or persona to be inappropriately borrowed from a culture that I don't have the right to represent. So, moving forward, I will be going by my first name, Austin, and rebranding everything as a derivative of that.\" His flagship shows The Rajjchelor and Rajj Royale were renamed to Love or Host and The Royale, respectively.\nIn July 2020, it was announced that Austin would be the host of a game show titled Dare Package on the streaming media channel VENN. On July 11, 2020, Austin, along with rapper Wiz Khalifa, hosted a charity stream for Rise Above the Disorder, a non-profit that focuses on providing mental health services to people of color.\nAt GlitchCon 2020, a virtual version of TwitchCon, Austin hosted a talent show featuring celebrity judges Andy Milonakis and T-Pain.\nOn March 11, 2021, Austin signed with the gaming organization 100 Thieves as a content creator.\n\n2022–present: Name Your Price and continued growth\nOn February 3, 2022, Austin signed with G4 to host Name Your Price, a 1970s-themed game show inspired by The Price Is Right, with Will Neff. On February 10, it premiered on Austin's Twitch channel. The show ran for two seasons before ending due to G4's shutdown in October 2022.\nAustin left 100 Thieves on March 6, 2023, and announced days later that he had joined Misfits Gaming as a content creator and executive producer. A few days later, he announced that his show, Name Your Price, would be revived through Misfits Gaming.\n\nIn mid-2023, Austin joined the Fear& podcast as a co-host alongside Hasan Piker, QTCinderella, and Will Neff.\nOn October 9, 2023, Name Your Price returned for a third season. This season is the first to utilize a touring format, with episodes set to be filmed in front of live audiences in Miami, Las Vegas (TwitchCon), Houston, and Long Beach. Each episode features Austin as a co-host alongside Will Neff, as well as other large streamers as contestants, product presenters, and guests.\nIn February 2024, Austin began hosting a new reoccurring show on his Twitch channel called In the Tub, where he joins fellow streamers in their bathtubs to informally interview them with various game segments throughout. On February 17, 2024, Austin along with co-host Will Neff were awarded the \"Best Streamed Series\" award for Name Your Price at The Streamer Awards.\n\nPersonal life\nAustin formerly described his sexuality as \"mostly gay,\" but has since clarified that he identifies as gay. He came out via Twitter in April 2020.\nAustin wanted to be a pilot when growing up, playing flight simulator games and later even practicing on a real full flight simulator. He is a fan of the Minnesota Vikings.\nAustin describes himself as \"fairly liberal\". He supported Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. He was invited to the 2024 Democratic National Convention as part of the \"Creators for Kamala\" campaign. In October 2024, Austin appeared in a livestream hosted by streamers Pokimane and Valkyrae, featuring U.S. senator Bernie Sanders, in support of the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nAwards and nominations\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawlhalla",
        "content": "Brawlhalla is a free-to-play platform fighting game developed by Blue Mammoth Games. It was originally released for macOS, PlayStation 4 and Windows in 2017, with ports for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Android and iOS released later. Full cross-play is supported across all platforms. The game was shown at PAX East in April 2014 and went into alpha later that month. An open beta became available in November 2015, followed by the game's full release in October 2017. The game features 65 playable characters, referred to as \"Legends\", each with unique stats, varied loadouts, and cosmetic skins and crossovers.\nOn March 5, 2018, Brawlhalla developer-publisher Blue Mammoth Games was acquired by the video game publisher Ubisoft. As a result of this, Ubisoft took over publishing duties and Rayman, alongside two other characters from the franchise, were added to the game on November 6, 2018. Brawlhalla was released for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One on the same day. On July 27, 2022, Ezio from Assassin's Creed became the second playable crossover character, alongside one other character from the franchise.\nOn July 6, 2018, Ars Technica released an article detailing precise player counts for Steam games obtained through a leak as a result of a \"hole\" in its API. This leak showed Brawlhalla to be ranked 24th in player count on Steam with a total of 8,646,824 players, out of all games featuring the Steam Achievements system. The Android version has more than 10 million downloads. Ubisoft reported more than 20 million players by February 2019. In April 2022, Brawlhalla achieved 80 million players.\n\nGameplay\nIn most of Brawlhalla's game modes, the goal is to knock one's opponent into one of four areas outside of the visual boundaries of the map referred to as blastzones, similar to Super Smash Bros. This can be done either by forcing them into one of the blastzones with an attack, or by preventing them from returning to stage and allowing gravity to force them into the bottom blastzone. Damage can be seen on the color display around each player's character icon, which darkens progressively from white to red to black as the character continues to get hit. The darker the color is, the farther the character will be knocked back when hit until a hit forces them into a blastzone. Entering a blastzone will result in the player losing a stock and their character respawning on stage. Either the last player with at least one stock or the player with the most points wins the match, depending on the game mode.\nThe game supports both local and online play. Competitive players can compete in 1-on-1 to climb through the rankings. They can also find a partner to play against other duos to increase their collaborative rank in either the standard stock game mode queue or a rotating queue that features a different game mode each season. Brawlhalla also has several casual modes: Free-For-All, 1v1 Strikeout, Experimental 1v1, and a different featured mode every week. Free-For-All is a chaotic mode where 4 players knock each other out to gain points. In 1v1 Strikeout, players pick 3 characters which they play for 1 stock each. Experimental 1v1 allows players to test out upcoming features against each other. Custom games can be hosted online and locally, and they support up to 8 players per match, experimental maps, and region changing. You may join groups of your friends to create a clan, with multiple ranks within the clans. Clans are only available on PC. Clans gain experience from all members.\nBrawlhalla features simple controls and one-button special moves. This allows new players to pick up the game quickly. Controls include movement keys and buttons for attacking, performing special moves, picking up or throwing weapons, and dodging. Keys can be rebound for the keyboard and a large variety of controllers.\nPlayers can move by running left and right and jumping. Players can perform quick dashes sideways on the ground and dodges in the air or on the ground, either sideways or vertically. It is also possible to dodge right after an attack to keep pressure on the opponent. Once in the air, the player has the option to perform any combination of three jumps, a directional air-dodge, a grounded move in the air by using a \"gravity-cancel\", and \"fast-falling\". It is also possible to hold on to the sides of stages, similar to the style in Mega Man X.\nDuring a match, gadgets (which can be switched off in the ranked game modes) and weapon drops fall from the sky semi-randomly and can be picked up by the players. Although the weapon drop sprite has the appearance of a sword it turns into a corresponding weapon for the legend that picks it up. All of Brawlhalla's characters can use 2 weapons out of 15 to fight each other. Weapons include blasters, katars, rocket lance, sword, spear, cannon, axe, gauntlets, hammer, bow, scythe, orb, greatsword, battle boots, and chakram. Blasters, rocket lances, bows, and spears perform well at a distance from the opponent, while katars and gauntlets are more effective up close. Rocket lance allows for quick traversal of the stage. Cannon, greatsword, and hammer all do large amounts of damage. Sword, orb, katars and battle boots are fast and low damaging. As chakram also does well at a distance, unlike others, it can split into two if the user holds down and attacks. All characters have unarmed attacks, should they be disarmed. Gadgets like bombs, mines, and spike balls are also used. Weapons can also be thrown to interrupt the enemy's moves or to make it difficult for them to get back to the stage. Each character has 3 special or \"signature\" moves per weapon, for a total of 6 per character.\nFour stats are assigned to each character: Strength, Dexterity, Defense, and Speed, each with a rating up to 10 (maximum 22). The combination of these stats determines the strengths and weaknesses of a character and affects how they're played, and can be slightly modified using stances- which move a point from one stat to another.\n\nBusiness model\nBrawhalla is free-to-play, based on the freemium business model. The game offers 9 selectable characters to use for free from a weekly rotation, making it more accessible for newer players. This number of free rotation characters increased from 6 in late 2018 to 8 in August 2020. There are currently 65 player characters, called \"Legends\" (as of March 2025). To fully purchase characters, Brawlhalla offers an in-game shop, giving a chance for players to use the in-game currency earned through matches, daily missions, and level-ups. Alternatively, players can purchase all existing and future characters via a one-time transaction of $39.99.\nOther products are also available to purchase here, using a premium currency called Mammoth Coins. Mammoth coins are named after the developing studio Blue Mammoth Games, and are only obtainable through in-game purchases. Mammoth coins can be used for products such as character skins, podiums, KO effects, weapon skins, avatars, sidekicks, and emotes that can be used in matches. Character skins come with two matching weapon skins, which may be used on any character that uses that weapon. Also in the shops are skin chests, being updated every 2 days. There are 21 themed chests, which offer many of the skins purchasable within the shop at a discounted price while offering 2 to 3 skins exclusive to the chest. These chests cost 100 Mammoth Coins to purchase and will randomly give the purchaser one of the skins offered. Excluding chests, any purchases made in the shop can be refunded for up to 90 days after the purchase, but players are limited to only 3 refunds per account. Refunds are not exclusive to purchases made with premium currencies.\nBrawlhalla has also introduced a battle pass system with 85 tiers of exclusive skins, emotes, and colors. The battle pass system has a weekly set of missions to be completed during matches, which range from straightforward tasks such as KOing with certain weapons to missions based on the in-universe lore. Completing each mission awards the player with \"Battle Gems\". Gems can also be obtained from ordinary daily missions, and a random number of either 2, 6, or 12 will be awarded after a player obtains a certain amount of XP from playing matches. The XP needed for each set of gems increases the more times a player has obtained the gems. Every 12 gems unlock a new tier of rewards on the reward track. The battle pass features both a free and a premium reward track. The premium track can be purchased for $9.99, and comes with a larger number of rewards. Character skins are exclusive to the premium track. The deluxe pass was added into Brawlhalla, offering an additional 25 tiers to the premium and free reward track. The Deluxe pass costs $24.99 USD or $14.99 if the premium pass is already owned.\n\nCross-play\nBrawlhalla introduced cross-play across all platforms on October 9, 2019. Cross-play allows players on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, Android and iOS to queue against each other in online ranked play and to create custom lobbies which a player on any platform can join.\n\nPlayable characters\nPlayable characters in Brawlhalla are referred to as \"Legends\", each with different stats, weapons, and cosmetic skins. As of March 2025, there are 65 playable characters in total, up from 34 at official launch.\n\nCrossover characters\nMany characters have skins that serve as crossover characters from other franchises. These characters can only be obtained through \"mammoth coins\" and not normal coins. They remain available in Brawlhalla's store even after the crossover event ends. Some crossovers may come on sale during special promotional events. The franchises and characters are as follows:\n\nEsports\nWhile minor events have been held by the community since its closed beta launch, Blue Mammoth Games now hosts its official competitive events.\nIn May 2016, they led off with the Brawlhalla Championship Series or \"BCX\". It was a series of 21 weekly online tournaments starting on June 18.\nIn 2017, Blue Mammoth Games announced the 'Brawlhalla Circuit, a worldwide circuit of tournaments. Players are awarded Points. Players with the highest points from each region at the end of the season will earn a spot in the World Championship in November.\nAt the start of 2018, Blue Mammoth Games announced their third year of official tournaments. This included a partnership with DreamHack to host 6 in-person tournaments throughout the year, including official tournaments in Europe.\nIn 2019, Blue Mammoth Games planned to host 5 in-person tournaments at their events throughout the year.\nIn more recent competition the Brawlhalla Pro Series (North America) was a weekly event that started April 9, 2019 and ended May 4, 2019.\nIn 2020, Brawlhalla Esports shifted to an online-focused competition due to the global pandemic.\n\n2016 World Championship\nThe Brawlhalla World Championship is a tournament held by Blue Mammoth Games at their end-of-the-year event, BCX (Brawlhalla Championship Expo).\nThe event took place at the Cobb Galleria in Atlanta in the United States. Players competed locally from November 11–13. The World Championship was separated into two separate open tournaments (1v1 and 2v2). The first 1v1 World Championship title was won by Zack \"LDZ\" Janbay, and the first 2v2 World Championship titles were won by Diakou \"Diakou\" State and Tyler \"Twilight\" Whitaker.\n\n2017 World Championship\nThe Brawlhalla World Championship became an annual event in 2017. The event once again took place at the Cobb Galleria in Atlanta in the United States where players competed locally on November 3–5. The 2016 1v1 World Champion Zack \"LDZ\" Janbay won for the second year in a row, while the 2v2 championship was won by Zack \"Boomie\" Bielamowicz and Ngwa \"Remmy\" Nforsi.\n\n2018 World Championship\nThe 3rd annual Brawlhalla World Championship was an open tournament with players being seeded based on official tournament power rankings. It took place on November 16–18 inside DreamHack Atlanta. The championship was played alongside tournaments of other popular fighting games, such as Super Smash Bros. Melee, Dragon Ball FighterZ and Tekken 7. The 1v1 World Championship title was claimed by Stephen Myers, known as \"Sandstorm\" and the 2v2 World Championship title went to Jonatan \"Cake\" Övragård and Aleksi \"Addymestic\" Sillanpää of Team PHZ.\n\n2019 World Championship\nThe 4th annual Brawlhalla World Championship took place at DreamHack Atlanta. The 1v1 World Championship was won for a second time by Stephen \"Sandstorm\" Myers, and for the first time, the 1v1 winner also won the 2v2 World Championship - alongside his teammate Zack \"Boomie\" Bielamowicz.\n\n2020 World Championship\nThe 5th annual Brawlhalla World Championship was shifted to an online competition due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Thus, the World Championship was split into five separate regions, with each region having their own 1v1 and 2v2 World Champions. The 2020 World Championship is largely considered to be one of the most controversial Brawlhalla tournaments in its history, due to it being dominated by a single weapon, Greatsword, which was in an extremely powerful state.\n\nNorth America: The 1v1 World Championship was won for a third time by Stephen \"Sandstorm\" Myers, and the 2v2 World Championship title went to \"Sandstorm\" alongside his teammate \"Boomie\" for the second time in a row.\nEurope: The 1v1 World Championship was won by Pavel \"Pavelski\" Milev, and the 2v2 World Championship was won by Denis \"Acno\" M and Axel \"Blaze\" V.\nSouth America: The 1v1 World Championship was won by Luan \"LX / HazardL\" Santos, and the 2v2 World Championship was won by \"LX / HazardL\" and Felipe \"DB\" Moraes.\nAustralia: The 1v1 World Championship was won by \"Dummy\", and the 2v2 World Championship was won by Jackson \"Kylar Alice\" Potts and \"Rite\".\nSoutheast Asia: The 1v1 World Championship was won by Jeffvinder \"Tiger\" Singh, and the 2v2 World Championship was won by \"Tiger\" and \"Reaper\".\n\n2021 World Championship\nThe 6th annual Brawlhalla World Championship was also an online competition, and the championship was split into five separate regions once again.\n\nNorth America: The 1v1 World Championship was won for the first time by \"Cody Travis\". The 2v2 World Championship title was won by \"Sandstorm\" and his teammate \"Boomie\" for the third time in a row.\nEurope: The 1v1 World Championship was won by Cyril \"Swata\" A, and the 2v2 World Championship was won by \"Acno\" and \"Blaze\" for the second time in a row.\nSouth America: The 1v1 World Championship was won by Alan \"Power\" Alvarez, and the 2v2 World Championship was won by \"Power\" and Wesley \"Wess\" Jean.\nAustralia: The 1v1 World Championship was won by \"Kylar Alice\", and the 2v2 World Championship was won by Joseph \"Doggo\" Ly and Bailey \"Elsom\" Elsom.\nSoutheast Asia:\" The 1v1 World Championship was won by \"Sire\", and the 2v2 World Championship was won by Gut \"Vortex\" Vongchanphen and \"Reaper\" (Reaper's 2nd time winning).\n\n2022 World Championship\nIn 2022, the World Championship returned to being an in-person event. The 1v1 World Championship was won by \"Impala\", and the 2v2 World Championship title went to \"Snowy\" alongside his teammate \"Boomie\" (his 5th time winning).\n\n2023 World Championship\nThe 2023 World Championship was once again an in-person event. The 1v1 World Championship was won by Nicolas \"Yüz\" Martins, and the 2v2 World Championship title went to Zivai \"Godly\" Manhotoma and Jon \"Zen\" M.\n\n2024 World Championship\nThe 2024 World Championship was once again an in-person event. The 1v1 World Championship was won by \"Yüz\" for the second year in a row, and the 2v2 World Championship title went to Murilo \"Kyna\" S and Lorenzo \"Lores\" C.\n\nCommunity\nOne factor that is critical to the longevity of a game is whether the players feel that their opinions are being heard by the developers. One way for a developer to demonstrate that they are listening to their community is through frequent updates that tailor the game to the needs of the community and maintain a playable state. A study that focused on 'urgent updates', which are defined as updates that, \"... are deemed critical enough to not be left unreleased until an upcoming regular-cycle update,\" found that for Steam's top games, including Brawlhalla, 39% of these 'urgent updates' were to fix crashes, and 25% made changes to the games' rules. The developer of Brawlhalla, Blue Mammoth Games, frequently uses the community's feedback to make changes to their game. It was especially common earlier in the development of the game for there to be a section included in the patch notes titled 'Community Requests'.\n\nReception\nKotaku summarized that \"Brawlhalla is a dynamic take on platform brawler that feels good to play.\" They said that the best innovations to the platform brawlers before it are its jumps and wall movements. Three jumps and nearly unlimited wall scaling make for fresh strategies and the buff in mobility means a lot of the high-adrenaline action happens off-stage. Push Square stated that while it is not quite as tightly designed as the seminal Super Smash Bros., the large roster, a wide range of modes, and a reasonable level of depth help it achieve a similar balance of accessibility and challenge, scoring it at 7 out of 10. Nintendo Life said that it \"stands as a solid example of how to do a proper platform fighter, with several game modes, a diverse cast and a beautiful art style making this one easy to recommend.\" PCMag summarised it as \"a worthwhile entry in the platform fighting genre that you can enjoy for free.\"\nOn the PlayStation store chart, it was the 2nd most downloaded game in North America, and number 3 in Europe.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Estradiol enantate/algestone acetophenide, also known as estradiol enantate/dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide (E2-EN/DHPA) and sold under the brand names Perlutal and Topasel among others, is a form of combined injectable birth control which is used to prevent pregnancy. It contains estradiol enantate (E2-EN), an estrogen, and algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide; DHPA), a progestin. The medication is given once a month by injection into muscle.\nE2-EN/DHPA is used widely throughout Latin America, is also marketed in Hong Kong, and was previously available in Portugal and Spain as well but was discontinued in these countries.\n\nMedical uses\nE2-EN/DHPA is used in combination as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women in Latin America and Hong Kong. E2-EN/DHPA has been said to be used by \"travestis\" (a term for transgender women in some cultures, especially in South America) as a means of feminizing hormone therapy as well.\n\nAvailable forms\nThe following forms of E2-EN/DHPA are or have been available for use:\n\nE2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 150 mg (brand names Perlutal, Topasel, many others)\nE2-EN 5 mg and DHPA 75 mg (brand names Anafertin, Patector NF, Yectames)\nE2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 120 mg (brand names Unalmes, Yectuna)\nE2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 75 mg (brand name Ova Repos; discontinued)\nA 6 mg E2-EN and 90 mg DHPA formulation was also studied, but was never marketed. The combination of E2-EN and DHPA has also been studied at other doses ranging from 5 to 50 mg E2-EN and 75 to 200 mg DHPA.\n\nPharmacology\nPharmacology\nClinical studies have found that, on the basis of endometrial changes, E2-EN/DHPA appears, at the doses used, to be an estrogen-dominant combination.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nBy intramuscular injection, the elimination half-life of E2-EN has been found to be 5.6 to 7.5 days, while the half-life of algestone acetophenide and its metabolites has been found to be 24 days. Following a single injection, E2-EN and DHPA are detectable in the circulation for up to 30 to 60 days.\n\nHistory\nE2-EN/DHPA was first studied as a combined injectable contraceptive in 1964. It was developed by Squibb under the developmental code name and tentative brand name Deladroxate for potential use as a combined injectable contraceptive in the United States. Due to toxicological findings of DHPA of pituitary hyperplasia in rats, mammary tumors in beagle dogs, and \"uterine swellings\" in animals, as well as concerns about possible accumulation of DHPA, Squibb discontinued the development of E2-EN/DHPA in the late 1960s. Subsequently, in 1973, a pharmacokinetic study of E2-EN/DHPA in women generated concerns about potential accumulation of E2-EN with once-monthly use as well. In spite of these concerns however, no toxicity or tumorigenicity has been observed with E2-EN/DHPA in humans in extensive clinical studies, and there are doubts about the relevance of the animal findings to humans. In addition, only very limited accumulation of E2-EN has been found to occur with the preparation.\nManufacturers in other countries, including EuroPharma, Farmitalia, and Promeco, resumed development of E2-EN/DHPA following the discontinuation of its development by Squibb, and introduced it for clinical use as a combined injectable contraceptive, under the brand names Perlutal and Topasel, in Spain and Latin America in the 1970s. It was one of only two combined injectable contraceptives to have been marketed by 1976, and was one of only three combined injectable contraceptives with considerable clinical experience by 1976. The others were estradiol valerate/hydroxyprogesterone caproate (EV/OHPC; brand name Injectable No. 1), which had been marketed in China, and estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate (EC/MPA; code name Cyclo-Provera), which was still experimental by 1976 and did not become formally available for clinical use until the 1990s. By 1994, at which point EC/MPA (brand names Cyclofem and later Lunelle) and estradiol valerate/norethisterone enantate (EV/NETE; brand name Mesigyna) had been introduced, E2-EN/DHPA had been in use for many years.\nE2-EN/DHPA and EV/OHPC have been referred to as first-generation combined injectable contraceptives, while EC/MPA and EV/NETE have been referred to as second-generation combined injectable contraceptives.\n\nSociety and culture\nBrand names\nE2-EN has been marketed under a wide variety of brand names. It has been marketed in a few different preparations, with varying doses of E2-EN and DHPA. These formulations all have different brand names, which include the following († = discontinued):\n\nE2-EN 10 mg / DHPA 150 mg: Acefil, Agurin†, Atrimon†, Ciclomes, Ciclovar, Ciclovular, Cicnor†, Clinomin, Cycloven, Daiva, Damix, Deprans, Deproxone, Exuna, Ginestest, Ginoplan†, Gynomes, Horprotal, Listen, Luvonal, Neogestar, Neolutin, Nomagest, Nonestrol, Normagest, Normensil, Novular, Oterol, Ovoginal, Patector, Patectro, Perludil, Perlumes, Perlutal, Perlutale, Perlutan, Perlutin, Perlutin-Unifarma, Permisil, Preg-Less, Pregnolan, Progestrol†, Protegin, Proter, Seguralmes, Synovular, Topasel, Unigalen, Uno-Ciclo, and Vagital.\nE2-EN 10 mg / DHPA 120 mg: Anafertin†, Patector NF, and Yectames.\nE2-EN 5 mg / DHPA 75 mg: Unalmes and Yectuna.\nE2-EN 10 mg / DHPA 75 mg: Ova Repos†.\nUnsorted: Evitas†, Femineo†, and Primyfar†.\nThe combination of E2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 150 mg was developed under the developmental brand name Deladroxate, but this brand name was never used commercially.\n\nAvailability\nDHPA has been marketed in combination with estradiol enantate (E2-EN) as a combined injectable contraceptive in at least 19 countries, mostly in Latin America. A few different preparations, with varying doses of E2-EN and DHPA and varying availability, have been introduced. These formulations have the following approval and availability († = discontinued in this country):\n\nE2-EN 10 mg / DHPA 150 mg: at least 19 countries, including Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal†, and Spain†.\nE2-EN 10 mg / DHPA 120 mg: at least 3 countries, including Brazil†, Chile, and Paraguay.\nE2-EN 5 mg / DHPA 75 mg: at least 9 countries, including Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Spain†.\n\nUsage\nE2-EN/DHPA is the most widely used combined injectable contraceptive in Latin America. It was estimated in 1995 that E2-EN/DHPA was used as a combined injectable contraceptive in Latin America by at least 1 million women. However, combined injectable contraceptives like E2-EN/DHPA are unlikely to constitute a large proportion of contraceptive use in the countries in which they are available.\n\nSee also\nCombined injectable birth control § Available forms\nEstradiol benzoate butyrate/algestone acetophenide\nList of combined sex-hormonal preparations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eugene Park, better known as Pobelter, is an American retired League of Legends player who was formerly the mid laner for Counter Logic Gaming. He is a three-time champion of the LCS and has made four major international appearances.\n\nEarly life\nPobelter has an older sister. He attended Troy High School in Fullerton, California. He tested into the school as he was an out-of-district student, and studied computer science in the Troy Tech magnet program. Pobelter initially played League of Legends as a hobby during high school.\n\nCareer\nPobelter played on Team Curse, and eventually moved to Winterfox, a team largely perceived as being built around him. After Winterfox's loss in the relegation tournament after the Spring 2015 season, Pobelter abandoned the team and moved to Counter Logic Gaming, which proceeded to win the Summer 2015 Split. CLG then elected to play Huhi as their mid laner, prompting Pobelter to move to Immortals, which had highly successful regular seasons in 2016 but strangely failed in playoffs, losing 0–3 to TSM in the semifinals of the NA LCS Spring Split playoffs in April, and losing 2–3 to Cloud9 in the summer seminals. They finished third in the 2016 Spring NA LCS, beating Team Liquid 3–0 in the third-place decider match. After Immortals were removed from the LCS in the 2018 season, Pobelter joined the successful Team Liquid. In 2019, Team Liquid replaced Pobelter with Jensen, and Pobelter went to Flyquest. Flyquest was reasonably successful in 2019 Spring, finishing fourth, but placed ninth in the Summer split. Flyquest announced that they had hired Tristan \"PowerOfEvil\" Schrage as their midlaner for 2020; Pobelter wrote in November 2019 that he had not been picked up by any team for a starting position in 2020.  Unable to find a position, Pobelter coached for Team Liquid during the first half of the 2020 Spring Split, but eventually returned to Counter Logic Gaming's as their midlaner. On August 5, 2020, he was optioned to CLG's academy team.\n\nTournament results\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A tipi or tepee ( TEE-pee) is a conical lodge tent that is distinguished from other conical tents by the smoke flaps at the top of the structure, and historically made of animal hides or pelts or, in more recent generations, of canvas stretched on a framework of wooden poles. The loanword came into English usage from the Dakota and Lakota languages.\nHistorically, the tipi has been used by certain Indigenous peoples of the Plains in the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies of North America, notably the seven tribes of the Sioux, as well as among the Iowa people, the Otoe and Pawnee, and among the Blackfeet, Crow, Assiniboines, Arapaho, and Plains Cree. They are also used west of the Rocky Mountains by Indigenous peoples of the Plateau such as the Yakama and the Cayuse. They are still in use in many of these communities, though now primarily for ceremonial purposes rather than daily living. Modern tipis usually have a canvas covering. \nNon-Native people have often stereotypically and incorrectly assumed that all Native Americans in the United States and Indigenous peoples in Canada have at one point lived in tipis, which is inaccurate, as many Native American cultures and civilizations and First Nations from other regions have used other types of dwellings (pueblos, wigwams, hogans, chickees, and longhouses).\n\nTerminology and etymology\nTipi is a loanword from the Dakota and Lakota language. Stephen Return Riggs' 1852 Dakota-English dictionary, which was sponsored by the Minnesota Historical Society spells it as tipi. Eugene Buechel spells it as tipi in his Lakota-English dictionary. Dakota ethnographer Ella Deloria used the spelling tipi throughout her writings, including in her essential book The Dakota Way of Life. Lakota linguist Albert White Hat developed his own Lakota orthography and used tipi as the spelling. The tipi image is used on almost all Dakota/Lakota tribal flags or seals, and tipi is the spelling used by Dakota and Lakota tribes today.\nThe spelling tipi is the one most common in Canadian English whereas the spelling tepee is the most common one according to American English dictionaries and the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia.\nThe wigwam or \"wickiup\", a dome-shaped shelter typically made of bark layered on a pole structure, was also used by various tribes, especially for hunting camps. The term wigwam has often been incorrectly used to refer to a conical skin tipi.\nThe conventional translation in French and English for all Indigenous dwellings at one time was \"lodge,\" resulting in many compounds and place names such as sweatlodge, lodgepole pine, Red Lodge, and so on.\n\nTypes and utility\nStructure\nA tipi is distinguished from other conical tents by the smoke flaps at the top of the structure. The tipi is durable, provides warmth and comfort in winter, is cool in the heat of summer, and is dry during heavy rains. Tipis can be disassembled and packed away quickly when people need to relocate and can be reconstructed quickly upon settling in a new area. Historically, this portability was important to Plains Indians with their at-times nomadic lifestyle. Tribes would have well-organized camp circles of family units living in multiple tipis arranged in order depending on rank or roles in the family unit, community, or ceremony. Generally, the door and camp openings face east in the direction of the sunrise.\nA typical family tipi is a conical, portable structure with two adjustable smoke flaps, multiple poles (historically from 12 to 25 ft or 3.7 to 7.6 m long) called lodge poles.\nLewis H. Morgan noted that tipi frames were 13 to 15 poles that were 4.6 to 5.5 metres (15–18 ft) tall. These poles, \"after being tied together at the small ends, are raised upright with a twist so as to cross the poles above the fastening.\" The builders pull the lower ends out to form a circle about 3.0 metres (10 ft) in diameter on the ground. They stretch a covering of tanned and untanned buffalo hides, sewn together, over the frame, which they then secure with stakes at the base. \"At the top there is an extra skin adjusted as a collar, so as to be open on the windward side to facilitate the exit of the smoke. A low opening is left for a doorway, which is covered with an extra skin used as a drop. The fire-pit and arrangements for beds are the same as in the Ojibwa lodge, grass being used in the place of spruce or hemlock twigs.\"\nLodgepole pine is the preferred wood in the Northern and Central Plains and red cedar in the Southern Plains.  Tipis have a detachable cover over the structure. The cover has historically been made of buffalo hide, an optional skin or cloth lining, and a canvas or bison calf skin door. Modern lodges are more often made of canvas.: p3, p58 \nRopes (historically rawhide thongs or babiche) and wooden pegs are required to bind the poles, close the cover, attach the lining and door, and anchor the resulting structure to the ground. Tipis are distinguished from other tents by two crucial elements: the opening at the top and the smoke flaps, which allow the dwellers to heat themselves and cook with an open fire; and the lining that is primarily used in the winter, which insulates. Tipis were designed to be easily set up or taken down to allow camps to be moved to follow game migrations, especially the bison. When dismantled the tipi poles were used to construct a dog- or later horse-pulled travois on which additional poles and tipi cover were placed.\nTipi covers are made by sewing together strips of canvas or tanned hide and cutting out a semicircular shape from the resulting surface. Trimming this shape yields a door and the smoke flaps that allow the dwellers to control the chimney effect to expel smoke from their fires. Old-style traditional linings were hides, blankets, and rectangular pieces of cloth hanging about 1.2 to 1.5 metres (4–5 ft) above the ground tied to the poles or a rope.\n\nDecoration\nHistorically, most tipis in a village were not painted. Painted tipis often depicted noteworthy historical battles and often featured geometric portrayals of celestial bodies and animal designs. Sometimes tipis have been painted to depict personal experiences such as war, hunting, a dream, or vision. When depicting visions, \"ceremonies and prayers were first offered, and then the dreamer recounted his dream to the priests and wise men of the community. Those known to be skilled painters were consulted, and the new design was made to fit anonymously within the traditional framework of the tribe's painted tipis.\"\nDuring the later reservation era, retired warriors would paint on canvas tipis depicting different events in tribal history, including battles with Americans. He Nupa Wanica (Joseph No Two Horns), a Hunkpapa Lakota warrior who fought in 40 battles, including the Battle of the Little Bighorn, is one such artist known for his many tipi paintings, shields and horse effigies now in museums.\n\nTeachings\nTribes today use the tipi as a means to convey traditional, scientific, and psychological teachings.  The Siksika (Blackfoot) nation's worldview is based on the shape of a tipi, which inspired Maslow's hierarchy of needs teachings. In Cree communities, the tipi can represent the power of women and their role as the foundation of the family unit. In Lakota communities, youth are taught how to assemble tipis, with each pole representing different traditional virtues, and are simultaneously taught geometry and  teamwork.\n\nSee also\nChum (tent), a similar structure used by various peoples from northwestern Siberia to northern Mongolia.\nGoahti, a somewhat similar structure used by the Sami people of northern Scandinavia\nLavvu, a conical tent covered with reindeer hides, used by the Sámi people of northern Scandinavia\nPlains hide painting\n\nNotes and references\nGeneral\nHolley, Linda A.

        "content": "Michael Santana, better known as Imaqtpie ( \"I'm a cutie pie\"), is an American League of Legends player. Formerly a professional player for Team Dignitas, he retired from professional play in 2014 to pursue a full-time streaming career on Twitch. He is one of League of Legends' largest online personalities with over 2.6 million followers on Twitch. In 2017 in an interview with Rolling Stone it was revealed he earns $2 million annually from streaming.\n\nCareer\n2011\nIn a Reddit AMA, Santana said the origin of his name came from his mom calling him \"cute\". At a young age, he played a lot of video games, particularly SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs. He first began playing League of Legends shortly after the game's creation because it was free to play. After a few months, he began competing in local tournaments, where he was noticed by other players such as William \"scarra\" Li, who recruited him in April 2011 as an AD Carry on the team Rock Solid. In September of that year, Team Dignitas acquired the team to venture into professional League of Legends, and with it acquired Santana, scarra, and Joedat \"Voyboy\" Esfahani. According to Santana, his parents were proud of his career. \"Having them support me and want me to do my best was very helpful for me to really focus on improving and doing what I had to do to be the best.\" A month later, the team won 1st place at IGN ProLeague (IPL) Season 3 in Atlantic City, defeating Epik Gamer 2–1 in the finals and earning a $10,000 prize for the team.\n\n2012\nIn 2012, the team won 1st place at the LoLPro.com Curse Invitational in San Francisco and earned a $20,000 prize for the team. Later that year the team placed 2nd at the MLG Summer Championship in Raleigh, North Carolina losing to Team Curse in the finals, but both teams were disqualified and not awarded a prize after an investigation by MLG found the teams guilty of collusion. In September, Team Dignitas placed 2nd in the Season 2 North American Regional Finals in Seattle, Washington at PAX Prime, losing to Team SoloMid in the finals but qualifying the team to compete in the Season 2 World Championship in Los Angeles. The team placed last during the group stage without a single win, but their participation at Worlds qualified the team to compete in the Season 3 Spring Split. TSM top laner Dyrus later publicly apologized for accidentally revealing Team Dignitas's secret strategy to their opponents prior to the group stage, and admitted that the strategy might have given the team the upper hand in the tournament. \"[Leaking the strategy] put Team Dignitas on tilt and lowered their morale... For those who say they would have lost anyway, that's not true because [TSM] lost to [the strategy] four times...\"\n\n2013\nIn 2013, the team started off strong, going 16–5 during the Spring regular season in the first 21 games, before going 1–6 in its final 7 games, ending the Spring regular season 17–11 but qualifying to compete in the Spring playoffs. In the Spring playoffs, the team placed last. In the 2013 Summer regular season, the team finished 5th with a score of 13–15 and qualified to compete in the Summer playoffs, but finished 4th, failing to qualify to compete in Worlds but allowing the team to compete next spring. When asked about avoiding relegation, Santana said \"I don't even know how that was possible. Against [Team Curse], I honestly thought we were going to get relegated that season, and we somehow beat them... it's sometimes like 'Man... is North America this bad?' We don't do anything special but we can somehow manage to make it to 3rd or 4th place in most things.\" When asked if players needed to be replaced due to underperforming, teammate William \"scarra\" Li said Santana was underrated by others in the scene due to his lack of publicity on social media in the past, saying he considered Santana and his partner Jordan \"Patoy\" Blackburn to be \"the best bot lane in North America... they're just insanely good.\" Li also praised Santana's knowledge of the game, saying \"He conceptualizes the game really really well, so he's like an AD Carry shot caller, which is very very unusual... He is one of the players [on the team] that would be very incredibly hard to replace.\"\n\n2014\nIn spring of 2014, Dignitas placed 4th during the regular season and did not qualify to compete in the playoffs. In the summer split, they placed 6th with a 13–15 record. In an interview, Santana said the team's lack of success was due to the players' desire to have fun, rather than to compete. \"We've always had problems with the team that have stopped us from being as good as we could be. I honestly feel like, with the people we have, we could be the best, it's just that our mentality is terrible so it just stops us from doing anything... We don't have drive.\"\nIn October 2014, Team Dignitas announced that William \"scarra\" Li would be leaving the team, and three weeks later the team announced that Santana would be following suit, the last two members of the original lineup. In a vlog uploaded to his YouTube channel, Santana explained his retirement from professional League of Legends, saying he enjoyed playing with friends more than competing professionally:\n\nIn the start of my career, League was awesome... but I never had it in me to cut players for under-performing and things like that, so as the scene became more and more competitive, I wasn't meshing well with the scene and where it was going... I wish it was the way it was before, where it was just like playing with friends, just enjoying the game and having fun... Because of that, I've decided that it's better off for me if I just don't re-sign [with Team Dignitas] and try to figure out what it is I'm looking to do... at the end of the day, all I wanted from League of Legends was a place to hang out and play games with people...\n\n2015–present\nAfter leaving Dignitas, Santana became one of the largest League of Legends streamers, with over 2.3 million followers on Twitch as of September 2018. His YouTube channel has over 1.6 million subscribers and 660 million views as of November 2020. According to an interview with Rolling Stone in 2017 Santana earns over $2 million a year as a Twitch streamer, not including corporate sponsorships.\nIn 2016, Santana was awarded The Esports Industry Awards Domino's Streamer of the Year award. In 2017, Santana was a nominee for the Teen Choice Awards Choice Gamer award.\nIn the summer of 2017, Santana briefly returned to competitive play, this time in the North American Challenger Series when Echo Fox announced a new sister team called Delta Fox. Santana joined its roster with former Team Dignitas teammates William \"scarra\" Li,  Joedat \"Voyboy\" Esfahani, Danny \"Shiphtur\" Le, and retired Team SoloMid player Marcus \"Dyrus\" Hill. An unconventional decision to create a team with a roster exclusively of retired players, fans began referring to the team as the \"Meme Team,\" prompting then-CEO Jace Hall to say \"This is not a joke.\" The team defeated Toronto eSports 2–0 in the 2017 Spring Qualifier before ending the Spring season 1–1–3. The team disbanded at the end of the summer split following a 0–10 record. When asked about the team's results, Echo Fox owner Rick Fox said \"...while the record may not show it, I have to think that it has reignited their competitive fire.\"\nAfter his run with Delta Fox, Santana continued streaming, primarily League of Legends.\n\nPersonal life\nIn July 2018 he had a surprise wedding with his girlfriend Lisha Wei, which gained media attention due to his attire: a T-shirt and shorts. He currently lives in California. Santana confirmed on his stream in early 2020 that he and Lisha were no longer together.\n\nNotable tournament results\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nImaqtpie on Twitch\nImaqtpie's channel on YouTube",

        "streamer": "CHESS",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess",
        "content": "Chess is an abstract strategy board game for two players which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a square game board called a chessboard containing 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as \"White\" and \"Black\", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns; each type of piece has a different pattern of movement. An enemy piece may be \"captured\" (removed from the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies; the object of the game is to \"checkmate\" (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.\nThe recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of chaturanga—also thought to be an ancestor to similar games like xiangqi and shogi—in seventh-century India. After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe. The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, with millions of players worldwide. \nOrganized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs; the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion, having won the title in 2024.\nA huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology. One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory; however, chess is not a solved game.\n\nRules\nThe rules of chess are published by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs; \"International Chess Federation\"), chess's world governing body, in its Handbook. Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ in some details. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2023.\n\nSetup\nChess sets come in a wide variety of styles. The Staunton pattern is the most common, and is usually required for competition. Chess sets come with pieces in two colors, referred to as white and black, regardless of their actual color; the players controlling the color sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively. Each set comes with at least the following 16 pieces in both colors: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.\nThe game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns (called files). Although it does not affect gameplay, by convention the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares. Common colors for wooden chessboards are light and dark brown, while vinyl chessboards are commonly buff and green.\n\nTo start the game, White's pieces are placed on the first rank in the following order, from left to right: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook. Pawns are placed on each square of the second rank. Black's position mirrors White's, with equivalent pieces on every file. The board is oriented so that the right-hand corner nearest each player is a light square; as a result the white queen always starts on a light square, while the black queen starts on a dark square. This may be remembered by the phrases \"white on the right\" and \"queen on her color\".\nIn formal competition, the piece colors for every matchup are allocated to players by the organizers. In informal games, colors may be decided either by mutual agreement, or randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose.\n\nMovement\nWhite moves first, after which players alternate turns. One piece is moved per turn (except when castling, during which two pieces are moved). In the diagrams, dots mark the squares to which each type of piece can move if unoccupied by friendly pieces and there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces). With the sole exception of en passant, a piece captures an enemy piece by moving to the square it occupies, removing it from play and taking its place. The pawn is the only piece that does not capture the way it moves, and it is the only piece that moves and captures in only one direction (forwards from the player's perspective). A piece is said to control empty squares on which it could capture, attack squares with enemy pieces it could capture, and defend squares with pieces of the same color on which it could recapture. Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental.\n\nThe king moves one square in any direction. There is also a special move called castling which moves the king and a rook. The king is the most valuable piece—it is illegal to play any move that puts one's king under attack by an opponent piece. A move that attacks the king must be parried immediately; if this cannot be done, the game is lost. (See § Check and checkmate.)\nA rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file. A rook is involved in the king's castling move.\nA bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.\nA queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal.\nA knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an \"L\"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.\nA pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can optionally advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (diagram dots). A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square (diagram crosses). It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file, nor can it move to either square diagonally in front without capturing. Pawns have two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.\n\nCheck and checkmate\nWhen a king is under immediate attack, it is in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position in which the king is no longer in check. There are three ways to counter a check:\n\nCapture the checking piece.\nInterpose a piece between the checking piece and the king (possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king).\nMove the king to a square where it is not under attack.\nThe object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to get it out of check. In casual games, it is common to announce \"check\" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of chess and is usually not done in tournaments.\n\nCastling\nKings can castle once per game. Castling consists of moving the king two squares toward either rook of the same color, and then placing the rook on the square that the king crossed.\nCastling is possible only if the following conditions are met:\n\nNeither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game.\nThere are no pieces between the king and the rook.\nThe king is not in check and does not pass through or finish on a square controlled by an enemy piece.\nCastling is still permitted if the rook is under attack, or if the rook crosses an attacked square.\n\nSpecial pawn moves\nPawns have two special moves:\n\nEn passant: when a pawn makes a two-square advance to the same rank as an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file, that pawn can capture it en passant (\"in passing\"), moving to one square behind the captured pawn. A pawn can only be captured en passant on the turn after it makes a two-square advance. In the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 takes it en passant, landing on g6.\nPromotion: when a pawn advances to its last rank, it is promoted and replaced with the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Usually, pawns are promoted to queens; choosing another piece is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram, the c7-pawn is advanced to c8 and promoted to a queen. If the required piece is not available (e.g. a second queen), an inverted rook is sometimes used as a substitute, but this is not recognized in FIDE-sanctioned games.\n\nEnd of the game\nWin\nA game can be won in the following ways:\n\nCheckmate: The opposing king is in check and the opponent has no legal move. (See § Check and checkmate.)\nResignation: A player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent. If, however, the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player, this is a draw under FIDE Laws. Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in a hopeless position.\nWin on time: In games with a time control, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue.\nForfeit: A player who cheats, violates the rules, or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited. Occasionally, both players are forfeited.\n\nDraw\nThere are several ways a game can end in a draw:\n\nStalemate: If the player to move has no legal move, but is not in check, the position is a stalemate, and the game is drawn.\nDead position: If neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves, the game is drawn. For example, if only the kings are on the board, all other pieces having been captured, checkmate is impossible, and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand, if both players still have a knight, there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate, so this rule does not apply. The dead position rule supersedes an older rule which referred to \"insufficient material\", extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible, such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns cannot be attacked.\nDraw by agreement: In tournament chess, draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move. More recently efforts have been made to discourage early draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before a certain point.\nThreefold repetition: This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. The addition of the fivefold repetition rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game a draw after five occurrences of the same position, consecutive or otherwise, without requiring a claim by either player. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition.\nFifty-move rule: If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, either player can claim a draw. The addition of the seventy-five-move rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after 75 moves without a pawn move or capture, without requiring a claim by either player. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made; examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops. Historically, FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames, but these have since been repealed. Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule.\nDraw on time: In games with a time control, the game is drawn if a player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player.\nDraw by resignation: Under FIDE Laws, a game is drawn if a player resigns and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate that player.\n\nTime control\nIn competition, chess games are played with a time control. Methods and bounds vary, but time controls are generally divided into categories based on the amount of time given to each player (FIDE adds sixty turns worth of increment to the starting time when measuring), which range from classical time controls, which allot an hour or more to each player and which can take upwards of seven hours (even longer if adjournments are permitted), to bullet chess, in which players receive less than three minutes each. Between these are rapid chess (ten to sixty minutes per player), popular in amateur tournaments, and blitz chess (three to ten minutes), popular online. Non-classical chess is sometimes referred to as fast chess.\nTime is controlled using a chess clock with two displays, one for each player's remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks, which allow for time controls with increments.\nThere are some aspects unique to online chess. A premove allows a player to submit a move on the opponent's turn, which gets played automatically if possible using little to no time. Premoves, alongside the relative ease of digital inputs, make faster time controls feasible online.\nTime controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions. A typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves. Time is usually alloted per move in online correspondence chess.\n\nNotation\nHistorically, many different notation systems have been used to record chess moves; the standard system today is short-form algebraic notation. In this system, files are labeled a through h and ranks are labeled 1 through 8. Squares are identified by the file and rank they occur on; g3 is the square on the g file and the third rank. In English, the piece notations are: K (king), Q (queen), R (rook), B (bishop), and N (knight; N is used to avoid confusion with king). Different initials are used in other languages. Moves are recorded as follows:\n\nnotation of piece moved – destination square\n\nFor example, Qg5 means \"queen moves to g5\". No letter initial is used for pawns, so e4 means \"pawn moves to e4\". When multiple moves could be rendered the same way, the file or rank from which the piece moved is added to resolve ambiguity (e.g. Ngf3 means \"knight from the g-file moves to the square f3\"; R1e2 means \"rook on the first rank moves to e2\"). If a move may be disambiguated by rank or file, it is done by file, and in the rare case that both are needed, squares are listed normally (e.g Qh4xe1).\nIf the move is a capture, \"x\" is usually inserted before the destination square, thus Bxf3 means \"bishop captures on f3\". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is often listed even when no disambiguation is necessary; for example, exd5.\nIf a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move (for example, e1=Q or e1Q). Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 for kingside castling and 0-0-0 for queenside castling. A move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation \"+\" suffixed. Checkmate can be indicated by suffixing \"#\". At the end of the game, \"1–0\" means White won, \"0–1\" means Black won, and \"½–½\" indicates a draw. Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols. For example: \"!\" indicates a good move; \"!!\" a excellent move; \"?\" a mistake; \"??\" a blunder; \"!?\" an interesting move that may not be best; or \"?!\" a dubious move not easily refuted.\n\nMoves are written as white/black pairs, preceded by the move number and a period. Individual white moves are also recorded this way, while black moves are rendered with an ellipsis after the move number. For example, one variation of a simple trap known as the Scholar's mate (see animated diagram) can be recorded:\n\n 1. e4 e5 2. Qh5?! Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6?? 4. Qxf7#\nThe move 3... Nf6?? is recorded as a blunder, as it allows 4. Qxf7# checkmate.\nGames or sequences may be recorded in Portable Game Notation (PGN), a text-based file format with support for annotative symbols, commentary, and background information, such as player names. It is based on short form English algebraic notation incorporating markup language. PGN transcripts, stored digitally as PGN (.pgn) files can be processed by most chess software and are easily readable by humans.\nVariants of algebraic notation include long algebraic, in which both the departure and destination square are indicated; abbreviated algebraic, in which capture signs, check signs, and ranks of pawn captures may be omitted; and figurine algebraic notation, used in chess books and magazines, which uses graphic symbols instead of initials to indicate pieces for readability regardless of language.\nUntil about 1980, the majority of English language chess publications used descriptive notation, in which files are identified by the initial letter of the piece that occupies the first rank at the beginning of the game. In descriptive notation, the common opening move 1.e4 is rendered as \"1.P-K4\" (\"pawn to king four\"). Another system is ICCF numeric notation, recognized by the International Correspondence Chess Federation though its use is in decline.\nIn tournament games, players are normally required to keep a score (written record of the game). This is a requirement in all FIDE-sanctioned games played at classical time controls. For this purpose, only algebraic notation is recognized by FIDE, though variants such as long algebraic are acceptable; game scores recorded in a different notation system may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute.\n\nGameplay\nTheory\nChess has an extensive literature. In 1913, the chess historian H.J.R. Murray estimated the total number of books, magazines, and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000. B.H. Wood estimated the number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, \"Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed.\" Significant public chess libraries include the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals; and the Chess & Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands, with about 30,000 books.\n\nStrategy\nChess strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).\nThe most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides. The point values used for this purpose are based on experience; usually, pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange), and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, since its checkmate loses the game, but is still capable as a fighting piece; in the endgame, the king is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook. These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece (e.g. advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares), coordination between pieces (e.g. a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight), or the type of position (e.g. knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions).\nAnother important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton): the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces, pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in pawn structure include isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and holes; once created, they are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).\n\nTactics\nIn chess, tactics generally refer to short-term maneuvers – so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in positions with a limited number of forced variations, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.\nTheoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers, for example: pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences. Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions – threats, exchanges of material, and double attacks – can be combined into longer sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players. A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination. Brilliant combinations – such as those in the Immortal Game – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. \nA common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' tactical skills, is a position where a combination is available and the challenge is to find it. Such positions are usually taken from actual games or from analysis of actual games. Solutions usually result in checkmate, decisive advantage, or successful defense. Tactical exercises are commonly found in instructional books, chess magazines, newspaper chess columns, and internet chess sites.\n\nPhases\nChess theory divides chess games into three phases with different sets of strategies: the opening, the middlegame, and lastly the endgame. There is no universally accepted way to delineate the three phases of the game; the middlegame is typically considered to have begun after 10–20 moves, and the endgame when only a few pieces remain.\n\nOpening\nCompetitive players typically learn, memorize, and play well-documented sequences of opening moves. The most common starting moves for White are 1.e4 and 1.d4, which usually lead to substantially different types of positions, and Black has multiple viable responses to both.\nSequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and are catalogued in reference works, such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are thousands of openings, though only a small fraction of them are commonly played; variations of openings may also be given names. Openings vary widely in character from quiet positional play (for example, the Réti Opening) to sharp aggressive play (like the Latvian Gambit). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves. \nAmateur players generally have little knowledge of opening theory, and may use heuristic strategies, such as playing conservatively to minimize the possibility of losing early to a prepared trap, though not all do so. Rigorous study is necessary for professional players, who often employ assistants called seconds to aid them in preparation. While top players typically play reputed variations of openings, they may also study dubious variations in the hopes that their opponent will overlook them in their own studies. The role of memorization in openings is sometimes controversial for delaying the onset of deliberation and creativity in chess games.\nThe fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:\n\nDevelopment: moving pieces (particularly bishops and knights) forward to squares on which they are useful (defending, attacking, and controlling important squares) and/or have the potential to take part in future plans and ideas.\nControl of the center: control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can inhibit the mobility of the opponent's pieces.\nKing safety: typically secured by castling; incorrectly timed castling can be wasteful or even harmful, however.\nPawn structure: players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.\nMost players and theoreticians consider that White, by virtue of the initiative granted from moving first, begins the game with a small advantage. Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and achieve equality, or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position.\n\nMiddlegame\nThe middlegame is the part of the game that starts after the opening. Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.\nSpecific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings that result in a specific type of pawn structure. An example is the minority attack, which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.\nAnother important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. simplify). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.\n\nEndgame\nThe endgame (also end game or ending) is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame:\n\nPawns become more important. Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote a pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank.\nThe king, which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame, emerges as a strong piece in the endgame. It is often used to protect its own pawns, attack enemy pawns, and hinder moves of the opponent's king.\nZugzwang, a situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur a disadvantage, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having the move is in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 allowing White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.\nEndgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board. Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides, and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings, such as \"rook and pawn versus rook\" endgames.\n\nProblems and studies\nChess problems (also called chess compositions) are composed positions, usually created for artistic effect rather than practical application. The creator is known as a chess composer. \nThere are many types of chess problems, the most common being directmates, in which White is required to move and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves, usually two or three, against any defense. \nThese are commonly referred to as \"two-movers\", \"three-movers\", or \"more-movers\". \"Many-movers\" (also known as \"long-range problems\") of over 100 moves have been composed, the current record standing at over 200; these usually require repetitions of the same manoeuvre in order to produce a repeated zugzwang and force detrimental pawn advances.\nDirectmates usually consist of positions unlikely to occur in an actual game, and are intended to illustrate a particular theme, usually requiring a surprising or counterintuitive key move. Themes associated with chess problems occasionally appear in actual games, when they are referred to as \"problem-like\" moves.\nOther common types of problems include:\n\nHelpmates, in which Black moves first and cooperates with White to get Black's king checkmated\nSelfmates, in which White moves first and forces Black to checkmate White\nRetrograde analysis problems, in which the solver is required to work out what has previously occurred in the game, for example to prove that castling is illegal in the current position\nThe above type of problems are usually considered orthodox, in the sense that the standard rules of chess are observed.\nFairy chess problems, also called heterodox problems, involve altered rules, such as the use of unconventional pieces or boards, or stipulations that contradict the standard rules of chess such as reflexmates or seriesmovers.\nStudies are usually considered distinct from problems, although there is some overlap. In a study, the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw, without specifying any particular number of moves. The majority of studies are endgame positions, with varying degrees of realism or practical application.\nTournaments for composition and solving of chess problems and studies are organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition (WFCC), which works cooperatively with but independent of FIDE. The WFCC awards titles for composing and solving chess problems.\n\nChess in public spaces\nChess is often played in public spaces such as parks and town squares. Although the nature of these games is often casual, the chess hustling scene has seen growth in urban areas such as New York City.\n\nOrganized competition\nTournaments and matches\nContemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments, and congresses. Thousands of chess tournaments, matches, and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels.\nTournaments with a small number of players may use the round-robin format, in which every player plays one game against every other player. For a large number of players, the Swiss system may be used, in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same (or as similar as possible) score in each round. In either case, a player's score is usually calculated as 1 point for each game won and one-half point for each game drawn. Variations such as \"football scoring\" (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw) may be used by tournament organizers, but ratings are always calculated on the basis of standard scoring. A player's score may be reported as total score out of games played (e.g. 5½/8), points for versus points against (e.g. 5½–2½), or by number of wins, losses and draws (e.g. +4−1=3).\nThe term \"match\" refers not to an individual game, but to either a series of games between two players, or a team competition in which each player of one team plays one game against a player of the other team.\n\nGovernance\nChess's international governing body is usually known by its French acronym FIDE (pronounced FEE-day) (French: Fédération Internationale des Échecs), or International Chess Federation. FIDE's membership consists of the national chess organizations of over 180 countries; there are also several associate members, including various supra-national organizations, the International Braille Chess Association (IBCA), International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD), and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA). FIDE is recognized as a sports governing body by the International Olympic Committee, but chess has never been part of the Olympic Games.\n\nFIDE's most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship, a role it assumed in 1948. The current World Champion is Gukesh Dommaraju of India. The reigning Women's World Champion is Ju Wenjun from China.\nOther competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship, the European Individual Chess Championship, the tournaments for the World Championship qualification cycle, and the various national championships. Invitation-only tournaments regularly attract the world's strongest players. Examples include Spain's Linares event, Monte Carlo's Melody Amber tournament, the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting, Sofia's M-tel Masters, and Wijk aan Zee's Tata Steel tournament.\nRegular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship.\nThe World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess Championship include both team and individual events. These are held independently of FIDE by, respectively, the World Federation for Chess Composition (WFCC), and the International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF).\n\nTitles and rankings\nIn order to rank players, FIDE, ICCF, and most national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. An average club player has a rating of about 1500; the highest FIDE rating of all time, 2882, was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.\nPlayers may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE:\n\nGrandmaster (GM) is the highest title a chess player can attain. For the GM title, a player must have had an Elo rating of 2500 or more at least once and must achieve three results of a prescribed standard (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones that can substitute for norms, such as winning the World Junior Championship.\nInternational Master (IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.\nFIDE Master (FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.\nCandidate Master (CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200.\nThe above titles are known as \"open\" titles, obtainable by both men and women. There are also separate women-only titles; Woman Grandmaster (WGM), Woman International Master (WIM), Woman FIDE Master (WFM) and Woman Candidate Master (WCM). These require a performance level approximately 200 rating points below their respective open titles, and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978, a number of women have earned the open GM title: 40 as of July 2023.\nFIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers. International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). National chess organizations may also award titles.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nTexts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the seventh century. Three are written in Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and one, the Harshacharita, is in Sanskrit. One of these texts, the Chatrang-namak, represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess. The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang, \"Chess\" in Pahlavi, was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm, a great ruler of India' during the reign of Khosrow I:\n\nDewasarm has fashioned this chatrang after the likeness of a battle, and in its likeness are two supreme rulers after the likeness of Kings (shah), with the essentials of rooks (rukh) to right and to left, with Counsellor (farzin) in the likeness of a commander of the champions, with the Elephant (pil) in the likeness of the commander of the rearguard, with Horse (asp) in the likeness of the commander of the cavalry, with the Footsoldier (piyadak) in the likeness of so many infantry in the vanguard of the battle.\n\nThe oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about 840, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (The Book of Chess). This is a lost manuscript, but is referenced in later works. Here also, al-Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India, along with the eighth-century collection of fables Kalīla wa-Dimna. By the 20th century, a substantial consensus developed regarding chess's origins in northwest India in the early seventh century. More recently, this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny.\nThe early forms of chess in India were known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), literally \"four divisions\" [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry – represented by pieces that would later evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada. Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in nearby Sasanian Persia around 600 A.D., where the game came to be known by the name chatrang (Persian: چترنگ). Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia (633–51), where it was then named shatranj (Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج), with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish, \"shatranj\" was rendered as ajedrez (\"al-shatranj\"), in Portuguese as xadrez, and in Greek as ζατρίκιον (zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh (\"king\"), from which the English words \"check\" and \"chess\" descend. The word \"checkmate\" is derived from the Persian shāh māt (\"the king is dead\").\n\nXiangqi is the form of chess best known in China. The eastern migration of chess, into China and Southeast Asia, has even less documentation than its migration west, making it largely conjectured. The word xiàngqí (象棋) was used in China to refer to a game from 569 A.D. at the latest, but it has not been proven that this game was directly related to chess.\nThe first reference to Chinese chess appears in a book entitled Xuánguaì Lù (玄怪錄; \"Record of the Mysterious and Strange\"), dating to about 800. A minority view holds that Western chess arose from xiàngqí or one of its predecessors. Chess historians Jean-Louis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton contend that xiangqi's intrinsic characteristics make it easier to construct an evolutionary path from China to India/Persia than the opposite direction.\nThe oldest archaeological chess artifacts – ivory pieces – were excavated in ancient Afrasiab, today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, and date to about 760, with some of them possibly being older. Remarkably, almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the Silk Road, from the former regions of the Tarim Basin (today's Xinjiang in China), Transoxiana, Sogdiana, Bactria, Gandhara, to Iran on one end and to India through Kashmir on the other.\n\nThe game reached Western Europe and Russia via at least three routes, the earliest being in the ninth century. By the year 1000, it had spread throughout both the Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe. A Latin poem called Versus de scachis (\"Verses on Chess\") dated to the late 10th century, has been preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland.\n\n1200–1700: Origins of the modern game\nThe game of chess was then played and known in all European countries. A famous 13th-century Spanish manuscript covering chess, backgammon, and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos, which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games. The rules were fundamentally similar to those of the Arabic shatranj. The differences were mostly in the use of a checkered board instead of a plain monochrome board used by Arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step. In some regions, the queen, which had replaced the wazir, or the king could also make an initial two-square leap under some conditions. \n\nAround 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in Europe, culminating, several major changes later, in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today. A major change was the modern piece movement rules, which began to appear in intellectual circles in Valencia, Spain, around 1475, which established the foundations and brought it very close to current chess. These new rules then were quickly adopted in Italy and Southern France before diffusing into the rest of Europe. Pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece; in light of that, modern chess was often referred to at the time as \"Queen's Chess\" or \"Mad Queen Chess\". Castling, derived from the \"king's leap\", usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety, was introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout Western Europe.\nWritings about chess theory began to appear in the late 15th century. An anonymous treatise on chess of 1490 with the first part containing some openings and the second 30 endgames is deposited in the library of the University of Göttingen. The book El Libro dels jochs partitis dels schachs en nombre de 100 was written by Francesc Vicent in Segorbe in 1495, but no copy of this work has survived. The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames.\n\n1700–1873: Romantic era\nIn the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from Southern Europe to mainland France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor, a musician by profession, who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, who won a famous series of matches against Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834. Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson's Divan in London.\nAt the same time, the Romantic intellectual movement had had a far-reaching impact on chess, with aesthetics and tactical beauty being held in higher regard than objective soundness and strategic planning. As a result, virtually all games began with the Open Game, and it was considered unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the King's Gambit and the Evans Gambit. This chess philosophy is known as Romantic chess, and its sharp, tactical style of play was predominant until the late 19th century.\nThe rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century. Also in the 19th century, the convention that White moves first was established (formerly either White or Black could move first). Finally, the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized – variations in these rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century. The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess, particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent. Since the 19th century, the only rule changes, such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition, have been technical in nature.\n\nAs the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.\nThe first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style was typical for the time. Sparkling games like Anderssen's Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy's \"Opera Game\" were regarded as the highest possible summit of the art of chess.\nDeeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy, an extraordinary chess prodigy. Morphy won against all important competitors (except Staunton, who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.\n\n1873–1945: Birth of a sport\nPrague-born Wilhelm Steinitz laid the foundations for a scientific approach to the game, the art of breaking a position down into components and preparing correct plans. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. This win marked a stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking, tactical style predominant in the Romantic era to a more positional, strategic style introduced to the chess world by Steinitz. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27 years, the longest tenure of any world champion.\nAfter the end of the 19th century, the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew. The first Olympiad was held in Paris in 1924, and FIDE was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event. In 1927, the Women's World Chess Championship was established; the first to hold the title was Czech-English master Vera Menchik.\nA prodigy from Cuba, José Raúl Capablanca, known for his skill in endgames, won the World Championship from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, from 1916 to 1924. His successor (1927) was the Russian-French Alexander Alekhine, a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946. Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later.\nIn the interwar period, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns, which become objects of attack. Among the innovations popularized by hypermodernists was the fianchetto: the development of bishops away from, rather than towards, the center, onto the b- and g-files.\n\n1945–1990: Post-World War II era\nAfter the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought. FIDE, which has controlled the title since then, ran a tournament of elite players. The winner of the 1948 tournament was Russian Mikhail Botvinnik. In 1950, FIDE established a system of titles, conferring the title of Grandmaster on 27 players. (Some sources state that, in 1914, the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch, and Marshall, but this is a disputed claim.)\nBotvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world, which mainly through the Soviet government's politically inspired efforts to demonstrate intellectual superiority over the West stood almost uninterrupted for more than a half-century. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American Bobby Fischer (champion 1972–1975). Botvinnik also revolutionized opening theory. Previously, Black strove for equality, attempting to neutralize White's first-move advantage. As Black, Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning. In the previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments, where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go through the \"Candidates\" stage, which was initially a tournament, and later a series of knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system operated on a three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to Vasily Smyslov, but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the 23-year-old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal, an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever, hence his nickname \"the magician from Riga\". Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.\n\nFollowing the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, Armenian Tigran Petrosian, a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963–1969. His successor, Boris Spassky from Russia (champion 1969–1972), won games in both positional and sharp tactical style. The next championship, the so-called Match of the Century, saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II, American Bobby Fischer. Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard-of margins, and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship. The match was followed closely by news media of the day, leading to a surge in popularity for chess; it also held significant political importance at the height of the Cold War, with the match being seen by both sides as a microcosm of the conflict between East and West. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when he was unable to reach agreement on conditions with FIDE, and Karpov obtained the title by default. Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively preparing openings.\nKarpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes. In the 1984 World Chess Championship, Karpov faced his toughest challenge to date, the young Garry Kasparov from Baku, Soviet Azerbaijan. The match was aborted in controversial circumstances after 5 months and 48 games with Karpov leading by 5 wins to 3, but evidently exhausted; many commentators believed Kasparov, who had won the last two games, would have won the match had it continued. Kasparov won the 1985 rematch. Kasparov and Karpov contested three further closely fought matches in 1986, 1987 and 1990, Kasparov winning them all. Kasparov became the dominant figure of world chess from the mid-1980s until his retirement from competition in 2005.\n\nBeginnings of chess technology\nChess-playing computer programs (later known as chess engines) began to appear in the 1960s. In 1970, the first major computer chess tournament, the North American Computer Chess Championship, was held, followed in 1974 by the first World Computer Chess Championship. In the late 1970s, dedicated home chess computers such as Fidelity Electronics' Chess Challenger became commercially available, as well as software to run on home computers. The overall standard of computer chess was low, however, until the 1990s.\nThe first endgame tablebases, which provided perfect play for relatively simple endgames such as king and rook versus king and bishop, appeared in the late 1970s. This set a precedent to the complete six- and seven-piece tablebases that became available in the 2000s and 2010s respectively.\nThe first commercial chess database, a collection of chess games searchable by move and position, was introduced by the German company ChessBase in 1987. Databases containing millions of chess games have since had a profound effect on opening theory and other areas of chess research.\nDigital chess clocks were invented in 1973, though they did not become commonplace until the 1990s. Digital clocks allow for time controls involving increments and delays.\n\n1990–present: Rise of computers and online chess\nTechnology\nThe Internet enabled online chess as a new medium of playing, with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time. The first such server, known as Internet Chess Server (ICS), was developed at the University of Utah in 1992. ICS formed the basis for the first commercial chess server, the Internet Chess Club, which was launched in 1995, and for other early chess servers such as Free Internet Chess Server (FICS). Since then, many other platforms have appeared, and online chess began to rival over-the-board chess in popularity. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world, combined with the success of the popular Netflix show The Queen's Gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments (notably PogChamps) and chess Twitch streamers, resulted in a surge of popularity not only for online chess, but for the game of chess in general; this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the 2020 online chess boom.\nComputer chess has also seen major advances. By the 1990s, chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs, and in 1997 Deep Blue defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess. In the 2010s, engines significantly stronger than even the best human players became accessible for free on a number of PC and mobile platforms, and free engine analysis became a commonplace feature on internet chess servers. An adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand-held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating, which has grown to be a major concern in both over-the-board and online chess. In 2017, AlphaZero – a neural network also capable of playing shogi and Go – was introduced. Since then, many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written, the best of which have surpassed the traditional \"brute-force\" engines. AlphaZero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game, which affected the style of play at the top level.\nAs endgame tablebases developed, they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game-theoretical outcome was previously unknown, such as positions with king, queen and pawn against king and queen. In 1991, Lewis Stiller published a tablebase for select six-piece endgames, and by 2005, following the publication of Nalimov tablebases, all six-piece endgame positions were solved. In 2012, Lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven-piece endgame positions. Use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis.\nTechnological progress made in the 1990s and the 21st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels, as well as the state of chess as a spectator sport.\nPreviously, preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as Chess Informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents' games. Today, preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games, and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties. A number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels, such as online courses, tactics trainers, and video lessons.\nSince the late 1990s, it has been possible to follow major international chess events online, the players' moves being relayed in real time. Sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves. Chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games, allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities. While in the past the moves have been relayed live, today chess organizers will often impose a half-hour delay as an anti-cheating measure. In the mid-to-late 2010s – and especially following the 2020 online boom – it became commonplace for supergrandmasters, such as Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen, to livestream chess content on platforms such as Twitch. Also following the boom, online chess started being viewed as an esport, with esport teams signing chess players for the first time in 2020. The number of esport teams signing chess players rose considerably in 2025, after chess was added to Saudi Arabia's Esports World Cup.\n\nGrowth\nOrganized chess even for young children has become common. FIDE holds world championships for age levels down to 8 years old. The largest tournaments, in number of players, are those held for children.\nThe number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era. Kenneth Regan and Guy Haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines. They concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher Elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play, rather than \"rating inflation\" or \"title inflation\".\n\nProfessional chess\nIn 1993, Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke ties with FIDE to organize their own match for the World Championship and formed a competing Professional Chess Association (PCA). From then until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Championships and respective World Champions: the PCA or \"classical\" champions extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of games, and the other following FIDE's new format of many players competing in a large knockout tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his PCA title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships, Kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again. Despite this, he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world's highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in 2005.\nThe World Chess Championship 2006, in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov, reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion. In September 2007, he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India. Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008, 2010 and 2012. Magnus Carlsen defeated Anand in 2013, defending his title in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021, whereafter he announced that he would not defend his title a fifth time. The 2023 championship was played between the winner and runner-up of the Candidates Tournament 2022: Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China. Ding beat Nepomniachtchi, making him the world champion. In 2024, Indian Gukesh Dommaraju beat Ding.\n\nConnections to other fields\nArts and humanities\nIn the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, chess was a part of noble culture; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the \"King's Game\". Gentlemen are \"to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes\", says the overview at the beginning of Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier (1528, English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby), but chess should not be a gentleman's main passion. Castiglione explains it further:\n\nAnd what say you to the game at chestes? It is truely an honest kynde of enterteynmente and wittie, quoth Syr Friderick. But me think it hath a fault, whiche is, that a man may be to couning at it, for who ever will be excellent in the playe of chestes, I beleave he must beestowe much tyme about it, and applie it with so much study, that a man may assoone learne some noble scyence, or compase any other matter of importaunce, and yet in the ende in beestowing all that laboure, he knoweth no more but a game. Therfore in this I beleave there happeneth a very rare thing, namely, that the meane is more commendable, then the excellency.\nSome of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy at least partially survive, such as the Lewis chessmen.\nChess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality. An example is Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum ('Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess'), written by an Italian Dominican friar Jacobus de Cessolis c. 1300. This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages. The work was translated into many other languages (the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473) and was the basis for William Caxton's The Game and Playe of the Chesse (1474), one of the first books printed in English. Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people, and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces:\n\nThe knyght ought to be made alle armed upon an hors in suche wyse that he haue an helme on his heed and a spere in his ryght hande/ and coueryd wyth his sheld/ a swerde and a mace on his lyft syde/ Cladd wyth an hawberk and plates to fore his breste/ legge harnoys on his legges/ Spores on his heelis on his handes his gauntelettes/ his hors well broken and taught and apte to bataylle and couerid with his armes/ whan the knyghtes ben maad they ben bayned or bathed/ that is the signe that they shold lede a newe lyf and newe maners/ also they wake alle the nyght in prayers and orysons vnto god that he wylle gyue hem grace that they may gete that thynge that they may not gete by nature/ The kynge or prynce gyrdeth a boute them a swerde in signe/ that they shold abyde and kepe hym of whom they take theyr dispenses and dignyte.\nKnown in the circles of clerics, students, and merchants, chess entered into the popular culture of the Middle Ages. An example is the 209th song of Carmina Burana from the 13th century, which starts with the names of chess pieces, Roch, pedites, regina... The game of chess, at times, has been discouraged by various religious authorities in Middle Ages: Jewish, Catholic and Orthodox. Some Muslim authorities prohibited it even recently, for example Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 and Abdul-Aziz ash-Sheikh even later.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, chess was viewed as a means of self-improvement. Benjamin Franklin, in his article \"The Morals of Chess\" (1786), wrote:\n\nThe Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:\nI. Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action ...\nII. Circumspection, which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: – the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations ...\nIII. Caution, not to make our moves too hastily ...\n\nChess was occasionally criticized in the 19th century as a waste of time.\nChess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs, and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries, hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.\nChess is many times depicted in the arts; significant works where chess plays a key role range from Thomas Middleton's A Game at Chess to Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, to Vladimir Nabokov's The Defense, to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig. Chess has also featured in film classics such as Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, Satyajit Ray's The Chess Players, and Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death.\nChess is also present in contemporary popular culture. For example, the characters in Star Trek play a futuristic version of the game called \"Federation Tri-Dimensional Chess\", and \"Wizard's Chess\" is played in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.\n\nMathematics\nThe game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics. Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess, such as the knight's tour and the eight queens puzzle, have been known for hundreds of years.\n\nThe number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be (4.59 ± 0.38) × 1044 with a 95% confidence level, with a game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120, a number known as the Shannon number. An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as zero (in the case of checkmate or stalemate) or (in a constructed position) as many as 218.\nIn 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either White can force a win, or Black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). With 1043 legal positions in chess, however, it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.\n\nApplied mathematics\nA novel methodology in steganography explores the use of chess-based covers (such as puzzles, chess problems, game reports, training documents, news articles, etc.) for concealing data within a selection of moves, each hiding some bits. Several proof-of-concept projects have been developed that convert text or files into binary code, which is then converted into a series of legal chess moves, that can then be decrypted and downloaded.\nCorrespondence chess has been historically suspected of being a potential steganographic medium. Melville Davisson Post documented a chess problem that was used to create a pictorial cipher during World War I. During World War II, extensive postal censorship was imposed on military personnel from the United States and Canada that made playing correspondence chess impossible, arising from suspicion that chess could be used to send secret messages to the enemies.\n\nPsychology\nThere is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about six positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.\nMore recent research has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research, however, fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are also important.\nFor example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to the general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.\nA relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in scientific literature as well as in popular culture. Academic studies that investigate the relationship date back at least to 1927. Although one meta-analysis and most children studies find a positive correlation between general cognitive ability and chess skill, adult studies show mixed results.\n\nOnline chess\nOnline chess is chess played over the internet. This is done through the use of internet chess platforms, which use Elo ratings or similar systems to pair up individual players. Online chess saw a spike in growth during the quarantines of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be attributed to both isolation and the popularity of Netflix miniseries The Queen's Gambit, which was released in October 2020. Chess app downloads on the App Store and Google Play Store rose by 63% after the show debuted. Chess.com saw more than twice as many account registrations in November as it had in previous months, and the number of games played monthly on Lichess doubled as well. There was also a demographic shift in players, with female registration on Chess.com shifting from 22% to 27% of new players. GM Maurice Ashley said \"A boom is taking place in chess like we have never seen maybe since the Bobby Fischer days\", attributing the growth to an increased desire to do something constructive during the pandemic. USCF Women's Program Director Jennifer Shahade stated that chess works well on the internet, since pieces do not need to be reset and matchmaking is virtually instant.\n\nComputer chess\nThe idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18th century; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax. Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful. Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s, chess enthusiasts, computer engineers, and computer scientists have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs. The groundbreaking paper on computer chess, \"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess\", was published in 1950 by Claude Shannon. He wrote:\n\nThe chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require \"thinking\" for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of \"thinking\"; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of\nmodern computers.\n\nThe Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) held the first major chess tournament for computers, the North American Computer Chess Championship, in September 1970. CHESS 3.0, a chess program from Northwestern University, won the championship. The first World Computer Chess Championship, held in 1974, was won by the Soviet program Kaissa. At first considered only a curiosity, the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three draws). There was some controversy over the match, and human–computer matches were relatively close over the next few years, until convincing computer victories in 2005 and in 2006.\nIn 2009, a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating of 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw. The best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players, to the extent that human–computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or the media. While the World Computer Chess Championship still exists, the Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) is widely regarded as the unofficial world championship for chess engines. The current champion is Stockfish.\nWith huge databases of past games and high analytical ability, computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches. Internet Chess Servers allow people to find and play opponents worldwide. The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games.\n\nRelated games\nRelated games include:\n\ndirect predecessors of chess, such as chaturanga and shatranj;\ntraditional national or regional games that share common ancestors with Western chess such as xiangqi (Chinese chess), shogi (Japanese chess), janggi (Korean chess), ouk chatrang (Cambodian chess), makruk (Thai chess), sittuyin (Burmese chess), and shatar (Mongolian chess);\nIn the comparison of chess with games often referred to as national forms of chess, chess may be referred to as Western chess or international chess.\n\nChess variants\nThere are more than two thousand published chess variants, games with similar but different rules. Most of them are of relatively recent origin. They include modern variations employing different rules (e.g. losing chess and Chess960), different forces (e.g. Dunsany's chess), non-standard pieces (e.g. Grand Chess), and different board geometries (e.g. hexagonal chess and infinite chess);\nIn the context of chess variants, chess is commonly referred to as orthodox chess, orthochess, and classic chess.\n\nSee also\nGlossary of chess\nGlossary of chess problems\nList of abstract strategy games\nList of chess players\nList of World Chess Championships\nOutline of chess\nWomen in chess\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBird, Henry (2008) [First published 1893].

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Genshin_Impact_characters",
        "content": "The cast of characters in HoYoverse's Genshin Impact hails from the continent of Teyvat, which has seven nations: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. Each nation is ruled by one of seven Archons, or gods. The seven Archons stand for seven different elements: Anemo (air), Geo (earth), Pyro (fire), Hydro (water), Cryo (ice), Electro (electricity), and Dendro (plant). Nearly all playable characters control one of these elements with help from a Vision, a device Celestia grants to those with great ambitions, with the exception of some characters who control the elements through their own supernatural powers, such as the Archons, Dainsleif, Neuvillette, and the Traveler (Aether/Lumine).\n\nCharacter creation and design\nSome of Genshin Impact's characters were first introduced in an official manga released prior to the game's launch.\nGenshin Impact producer Cai Haoyu said that characters are one of the most important components of the game. The characters have unique gameplay based on different elements, which represent the cultural characteristics of the respective regions the characters are from. The multi-character design of the game is derived from Japanese card games. To meet the needs of players, new characters will be continuously introduced. At the same time, contrary to mainstream and past designs that used characters to serve the plot, the production team made a design in which the narrative is centered on characters, carrying out multi-plotline parallel narratives under the same worldview. In addition, the characters of Genshin Impact are the main source of profit for the game, while other content in the game is provided to players for free.\nEach character is designed by a team rather than an individual and there are no \"art director\" or \"creative director\" positions in MiHoYo. The production team will first establish the character's background story and place of residence, then conduct internal discussions and brainstorming. The production team will work as a group to evaluate the character's art style, background design, and gameplay mechanics based on player preferences. After the character concept design is established, the character design process will enter the modeling stage. The production team will continuously review the character's 3D model to ensure that it is consistent with the concept drawing. In terms of character rendering, the in-game character model and the scene are rendered independently. The scene uses deferred shading, while the characters use forward rendering, allowing the production team to control all lighting effects to ensure that the effect of the character presentation always meets the artist's expectations. To maintain the display effect of the character's face, a system that will automatically adjust according to the direction of the main light source was designed. In terms of the overall shadow effect of the character, the production team will ensure the cartoonishness of the character through cel shading, allowing the character to be affected by real-time light sources.\nIn terms of character artificial intelligence (AI) design, the production team has been developing the game's character AI system since 2017. AI is mainly divided into three categories: humans, wildlife, and non-player characters (NPCs) in combat. There were more than 200 types of AI in the early stages of the game. With the increase in AI brought about by game updates, the production team designed an AI framework and established an independent AI pipeline, breaking the inference modules into different categories according to each function to facilitate subsequent updates and maintenance. The character's behavior is based on a decision tree system to determine the character's skills or movements, and the data will be imported into the animation system for execution. The entire system facilitates giving NPCs different personalities and special abilities, also allowing boss-type characters to have unique actions.\nIn terms of character background setting, the production team will create the character image by building interpersonal relationships for the character and refining the regional cultural background of the character's origin. Before the character is officially launched in the game, miHoYo will release character-related videos through its official social media accounts for promotion. In the initial stage, \"Character Teasers\" will be released to show the character's image, identity and personality. This kind of video is usually produced in Live2D to help players establish a first impression of the character and spark discussion among players about the character. After that, the \"Character Demo\" videos are released, showing the character's 3D model, combat animation, skill effects, and some story clips about the character. Finally, \"Collected Miscellany\" videos show how to use the character's skills, basic stat changes and other information, also explaining the character's personality based on the worldview.\nAfter the character is officially launched in the game, the production team will launch a character-specific plot, or add content for the character to interact with players in the main storyline and event quests so that the character can attract players' attention soon after its launch. If the player obtains the character, they can obtain more information about the character through character stories. The stories will be gradually unlocked as the player's friendship level with the character increases. In the character's voice-over list, players can see and listen to the character's views on other characters. In addition to showing the character's interpersonal relationships, this also shows the character's personality and values. Some voice lines in the voice-over sections tease things to come, serving as hints and references to upcoming content in the game, including new characters.\nOn character birthdays or during in-game events, players will receive letters from relevant characters to increase interaction with players. miHoYo has launched character design surveys to gather feedback on players' opinions on the game's character designs, including what they look for in characters, whether the character's design is close to reality, fits their identity and personality, is original, lines up with other from the same faction, or contains regional cultural elements.\nOutside of the game, miHoYo will sometimes launch fan creation activities for specific characters to guide players to participate in discussion and creation, better promoting the characters. The free official manga allows players and fans of characters to spend more time with characters while introducing new characters to them, helping players better understand the game's lore and shedding light on the backgrounds of upcoming characters or those not in the game. In the collaborative activities with KFC, the characters participating in the activities will appear as another side of their persona that is different from their in-game side, with a more modern and lifelike essence.\nIn terms of gameplay, the playable characters have constellations. When the player obtains the character for the first time, it is called \"C0\". After that, when the same character is acquired repeatedly, the constellations will be activated, which can provide additional status effects; each character has six constellation levels. The character's constellation name and the names of each level are usually related to the character's setting and identity. For example, Hu Tao's constellation name (Papilio Charontis) is related to work in the deathcare industry. The player can choose the Traveler's in-game birthday and celebrate the birthdays of all other playable characters plus Paimon. On character birthdays, the player will receive a short message from the character, including their signature dish and other items; for the Traveler, a birthday cake is sent to the player via in-game mail.\nWhen designing characters, the designers first decide who the character is at their core as well as their needs, then may design them to fit that original idea and those needs. Designers may also consider the relation of a character to other characters in Teyvat: for instance, the elegant and reserved opera singer Yun Jin was designed to juxtapose the fiery and unbound rock star Xinyan.\nMany characters are derived from legends of certain nations: for instance, the adepti of Liyue are based on the Xian of Daoism. The idea of the Vision is derived from Daoism: in the game, the concept of a third eye manifests itself in humans in the form of their Vision. Some characters are named after historical or literary figures; for example, Alhaitham, Tighnari, and Xiangling are named after Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Tighnari, and Xiangling from Dream of the Red Chamber.\n\nCharacters\nPlayable\nThe following is a table that lists all currently confirmed playable characters by region in alphabetical order. All playable characters are associated with a specific region, with the exception of the Travelers and Aloy, who come from their own world.\nAll characters wield one of 5 weapon types: swords, polearms, claymores, bows, or catalysts.\n\nOutlanders\nMondstadt\nMondstadt was released in September 2020.\n\nLiyue\nLiyue was released in September 2020.\n\nInazuma\nInazuma was released in July 2021.\n\nSumeru\nSumeru was released in August 2022, and introduced the Dendro element to the game.\n\nFontaine\nFontaine was released in August 2023.\n\nNatlan\nNatlan was released in August 2024. Natlan characters are grouped into the six tribes of the nation: Nanatzcayan (Children of Echoes), Meztli (People of Springs), Huitztlan (Scions of the Canopy), Mictlan (Masters of the Night-Wind), Tlalocan (Flower-Feather Clan) and Teteocan (Collective of Plenty); each of which aligns with six of the game's seven elements and owns a specific species of Saurian (tamed and developed dragon). The names of Natlan's tribes are derived from the Thirteen Heavens.\n\nSnezhnaya\nSnezhnaya is expected for release in 2026. Some characters from Snezhnaya have already been released due to their involvement in other regions' Archon Quests.\n\nKhaenri'ah\nKhaenri'ah is expected to be released after Snezhnaya.\n\nNon-playable\nPaimon (Voiced by: ZH: Duoduo Poi (Shi Xinlei), EN: Corina Boettger, JA: Aoi Koga, KO: Kim Ga-ryeong) The Traveler's guide and companion, who mostly speaks for them due to them being a silent protagonist.\nUnknown God (Voiced by: ZH: Tao Dian, EN: Christie Cate, JA: Rie Kugimiya, KO: Unknown) The mysterious god who fights the Traveler and abducts their sibling at the beginning of the game, thus beginning their journey through Teyvat.\nKatheryne (Voiced by: ZH: Xiao N (Jiang Li), EN: Erica Mendez, JA: Mai Sato, KO: Park Go-woon) The receptionist of the Adventurer's Guild.

Arlecchino and Tartaglia are playable Harbingers.\nIl Capitano (Voiced by: ZH: Wang Wei, EN: Chris Tergliafera, JA: Narita Ken, KO: Min Eung-sik), or \"The Captain\", the First Harbinger. Extremely powerful and enigmatic, he is well-respected within the Fatui, and has a strong sense of righteousness. A survivor of Khaenri'ah, he fled to Natlan, only to find that the nation was under attack by the Abyss Order, which he was forced to fight. He eventually joined the Fatui. In Natlan, he decides to confront Mavuika, the Pryo Archon, and loses the duel but manages to escape with the help of Ororon. He then meets the Traveler and reveals his plan to save Natlan by rebuilding the nation's severely damaged Ley Lines. However, his plan fails as it instead awakens Yohualtecuhtin, the Lord of the Night. He eventually agrees to Mavuika's plan and assists her in repelling the Abyss when they invade the nation. Afterward, he helps the Natlanese recover from post-traumatic stress disorder. After the victory over the Abyss, he sacrifices his life force to Yohualtecuhtin in Mavuika's place. Without consciousness, his physical body permanently sits on a throne in Ochkanatlan. His real name is Thrain.\nIl Dottore (Voiced by: ZH: Wu Lei, EN: Mick Wingert, JA: Toshihiko Seki, KO: Park Seong-tae), or \"The Doctor.\" The Second Fatui Harbinger, he is a mad scientist who conducts experiments on his test subjects and abandons them should the experiments fail.

Her real name is Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter.\nTraveler's Sibling (Voiced by: Aether: ZH: Luyin (Dong Hailong), EN: Zach Aguilar, JA: Shun Horie, KO: Lee Kyung-tae; Lumine: ZH: Yanning (Geng Minglin), EN: Sarah Miller-Crews, JA: Aoi Yuki, KO: Lee Sae-a) Lost twin sibling of the Traveler and the Prince/Princess of the Abyss Order. During the beginning cutscene, the sibling is sealed first by the Unknown God. It is later revealed in the end of Sumeru chapter that the sibling is not considered as Descender as Irminsul has the records of the sibling's sudden appearance in Khaenri'ah before the Cataclysm and their journey through the seven nations of Teyvat after being sealed.

Originally an Oceanid, she was transformed into human by her predecessor, Egeria. After ascended as Hydro Archon, she separated her divinity from her body and spirit 500 years before the main events of the game, and named the human body \"Furina\". Focalors then instructed Furina to take the throne of Divine Throne to impersonate Hydro Archon for 500 years while she kept her Gnosis in her divine half and hid inside the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, accumulating Indemnitium in the device. Eventually, Indemnitium accumulated enough for Focalors to sacrifice to save Fontainians from dissolving, shattering the Divine Throne in the process and returning her elemental authority to Hydro Sovereign, Neuvillette.\n Oz (Voiced by: ZH: Zhao Yuecheng, EN: Ben Pronsky, JA: Masutani Yasunori, KO: Lee Hyun) Fischl's night raven familiar and companion.

In return, he would be Kinich's companion and would lend his powers to him on a limited, restricted basis. His name means Destined Rulership.\n\nReception\nThe characters of Genshin Impact have enjoyed positive reception, especially in terms of revenue: as Genshin Impact is a gacha game, much of its revenue comes from sales of in-game currency players use to obtain characters. Most revenue comes from limited character banners. Across all platforms, including mobile, console and computer platforms, the game is estimated to have grossed nearly US$3.7 billion in its first year by September 2021, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game. The mobile version grossed a further US$567 million between January and March 2022.\nSeveral of the game's characters have enjoyed massive popularity and have earned millions of dollars in revenue. For instance, in March 2021, it was reported that Zhongli was the game's highest grossing character, with US$15.5 million reported in revenue at the time. This number was later eclipsed by the December 2022 release of the Raiden Shogun, whose first banner earned US$9 million in two days from Chinese iOS sales; by the time the banner ended, it had netted around US$33 million in the Chinese market alone. Shogun's record was eventually broken by the November 2, 2022 banner, which introduced the Dendro archon Nahida and earned US$34 million in the Chinese market.\n\nControversies\nIn November 2020, following Zhongli's release he received criticism from fans; due to his equipment and gameplay being viewed as poor, many took Zhongli as an insult toward Chinese players. miHoYo published a blog post in response, noting that the character was working as designed. Later, miHoYo issued an apology, and promised to improve the character's kit during beta testing for version 1.3.\nIn early March 2023, HoYoverse was criticized following Dehya's release, as some of the game's fanbase argued that her kit was underpowered and dysfunctional, particularly compared to those of lower-rarity characters. Several  players announced that they had stopped spending money on the game, while others sent feedback to HoYoverse demanding improvements. As one of the few dark-skinned playable characters in the game, some suggested that her poor skillset might be due to colorism, given similar accusations made against HoYoverse in the past. A campaign urging the wider playerbase to press HoYoverse for change trended on Twitter under the hashtag #FixDehya, with many spamming the game's official account.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leslie Ann Fu (born November 23, 1992), better known as fuslie, is an American live streamer, YouTuber and musician. She is a content creator for the gaming organization and lifestyle brand 100 Thieves.\n\nEarly life\nFu was born on November 23, 1992, to Chinese parents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Fu has a brother named Nathaniel Fu. She attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California. Fu graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2014, earning a bachelor's degree in biological sciences. Fu briefly attended graduate school at the University of California, Los Angeles for teaching before dropping out to pursue streaming full-time.\n\nCareer\nFu began streaming on Twitch in February 2015 after being introduced to the activity by her roommates. Before branching out towards a wider variety of games, she primarily streamed League of Legends. She briefly was a streamer for professional League of Legends teams Immortals and Phoenix1.\nIn December 2018, Fu, along with fellow Twitch streamer BoxBox, hosted a 4-day streaming boot camp titled Streamer Camp, an event aimed at improving the skills of up-and-coming Twitch streamers and content creators. A second season of the event was held in June 2019. A third season was scheduled to be held in 2020 but was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2019, Fu was featured in an advertisement for karaoke video game Twitch Sings.\nFu was one of many streamers affected by the large wave of DMCA takedown notices issued against Twitch in June 2020. After receiving two strikes, Fu criticized the platform's response to the situation saying, \"On top of it being near impossible for me to delete 100,000 clips, the creator dashboard isn't loading any of my old clips. How am I supposed to protect myself here? This is an issue way bigger than me. Content creators aren't being informed by Twitch on the proper steps to protect themselves from this happening, and there has to be a better way to handle this than suddenly striking our accounts and banning us out of nowhere.\"\nIn June 2020, Fu participated in a Chess.com tournament for Twitch streamers titled PogChamps. She made it to the quarterfinals of the consolation bracket, where she lost to fellow streamer xQc. Fu would later be one of over 40 streamers featured on the cover of the August 2020 edition of Chess Life.\nOn September 2, 2020, Fu announced that she signed an exclusive contract with Twitch.\nOn March 26, 2021, Fu created the character “April Fooze” for the online modded Grand Theft Auto V roleplay server, NoPixel. As part of her character, Fu has released a number of collaborative songs under the name April Fooze, including “If You’re Broke I’m Busy (ft. Ryan King)” and “April’s Fool (ft. SocialTea and Ryan King)” between March - April, 2022. Fooze has also been featured on a number of tracks by other NoPixel music artists, such as “SUGRBABY” by Liz Anya and “SL*T4U” by the Bimbos.\nOn May 12, 2021, Fu joined the gaming organization and lifestyle brand 100 Thieves as a content creator.\nOn August 12, 2021, Fu starred in the music video for Sub Urban and Bella Poarch's song, \"Inferno\". She also participated in a stream promoting the video. That same day, she hit 1 million followers on Twitch.\nOn September 6, 2022, Fu announced that she would be leaving Twitch for an exclusive streaming contract on YouTube.\nIn July and August 2023, Fu participated in the PogChamps 5 chess tournament.\nFrom July 27 to 30, 2023, Fu co-hosted the fourth season of Streamer Camp alongside fellow streamers BoxBox, QTCinderella, and Kkatamina.\nOn August 8, 2024, Fu announced on stream that she would be taking a hiatus from streaming after confirming that she had an \"emotional affair\" with fellow content creator NoahJ456, while he was still married.  Fu returned to streaming on September 19, 2024. In October 2024, Fu announced that her YouTube streaming contract had expired and she will be simulcasting her live streams on both YouTube and Twitch.\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn March 2019, Fu partnered with the North America Scholastic Esports Federation (NASEF) and the Anaheim Ducks hockey team in holding an NHL 19 tournament. The tournament gave away over $25,000 in scholarships and grants to high school students. Fu has also spoken to NASEF voicing her support for women in gaming.\nOn December 2, 2019, Fu held a charity fundraiser stream benefitting Stand Up to Cancer. Fu and her viewers raised over $30,000 for cancer research.\nOn October 19, 2021, Fu in collaboration with 100 Thieves hosted a charity fundraiser streamer for the National Breast Cancer Foundation, raising $55,000.\n\nPersonal life\nFu dated former OfflineTV manager Edison Park, and the couple became engaged on April 7, 2019, before announcing their split in September 2021.\n\nDiscography\nFilmography\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nFuslie at IMDb",

        "content": "Fanfan (Fanfan & Alexandre) is a 1993 French romantic comedy film written and directed by Alexandre Jardin and starring Sophie Marceau and Vincent Perez. This film is based on the director's best-selling 1990 novel, which was translated into almost two dozen languages.\n\nPlot\nAlexandre (Vincent Perez) feels disillusioned with his fiancée, Laure (Marine Delterme), whose idea of romance is a pair of slippers for Valentine's Day. Their once passionate relationship has settled into monotony. To clear his mind, Alexandre visits the beach cottage of his friends Ti (Gérard Séty) and Maude (Micheline Presle), where he meets Fanfan (Sophie Marceau), Maude's granddaughter, a student studying to become a perfumer. Though they sleep in the same bed that night, Alexandre avoids any physical contact.\nAs the days pass, Alexandre and Fanfan grow closer. Fanfan takes him to an abandoned house where they share intimate conversations. Back at his apartment, Laure tries to reignite their relationship by dressing as an Italian call girl, but the attempt falls flat. Laure's father's gloomy talk of Alexandre joining the funeral business and the bleak future of marriage discourages him further.\nFanfan confesses to a friend that she's in love with Alexandre, but for him, things are more complex. He confides in Ti that all his relationships lose their magic once sex is involved. He proposes a solution: Platonic love. To preserve the excitement of unfulfilled desire, Alexandre vows to court Fanfan forever without revealing his feelings or engaging physically. He decides to stay with Laure physically while remaining emotionally connected to Fanfan.\nAlexandre and Fanfan share a romantic evening, but when the owner of the apartment they’re using returns, they narrowly escape. Alexandre then creates a magical experience for Fanfan at a television studio, dancing with her in an 1813 Vienna set. However, when he toasts to their \"friendship,\" Fanfan is disappointed and leaves to meet her friend Paul, a sculptor doing a nude study of her.\nAt home, Laure suspects Alexandre of seeing someone else. He admits it, but insists nothing will come of it. Laure begins planning their wedding, but Alexandre envisions them turning into her parents. Meanwhile, Fanfan, frustrated with Alexandre’s behavior, confronts him. She gives him an ultimatum: choose between her and Laure. Though Alexandre claims to want only friendship, Fanfan knows he is attracted to her.\nOne evening, Alexandre secretly adds sleeping powder to Fanfan's drink, and while she sleeps, he sensually applies sunscreen on her back. Just as he is about to kiss her, Laure arrives, announcing she is pregnant and the wedding plans are set. Disgusted, Fanfan leaves.\nLater, Alexandre discovers that Laure lied about being pregnant, and they break up. He spots Fanfan boarding a bus to Italy but doesn’t chase after her. Ti warns him that Fanfan won’t wait forever. Determined, Alexandre rents the apartment next to hers and installs a two-way mirror to secretly watch her.\nBack from Italy, Fanfan surprises Alexandre by bringing Paul along on a weekend trip, making him jealous. Alexandre admits that Laure's pregnancy was a lie, but Fanfan says it’s too late. She pretends to be marrying Paul to provoke Alexandre. He discovers the truth through the two-way mirror—Fanfan is still in love with him.\nFanfan confronts Alexandre, and he confesses that he didn’t chase the bus because he knew their relationship would eventually lose its spark. Fanfan gives him one last chance, telling him to come to her room by 10:00 pm or lose her forever. When he doesn't show up, she moves out, leaving a note that she’s going to see her sister. Alexandre is devastated when he learns from Maude that Fanfan’s sister is dead, implying Fanfan may be contemplating suicide. Just then, the mirror between them cracks, and Fanfan breaks through the barrier. They kiss, and Fanfan gives Alexandre until morning to win her back.\n\nCast\nSophie Marceau as Fanfan\nVincent Perez as Alexandre\nMarine Delterme as Laure\nGérard Séty as Ti\nBruno Todeschini as Paul\nMicheline Presle as Maude\nGérard Caillaud as Le père de Laure\nThierry Lhermitte\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe film topped the box office on its opening weekend in France, playing at 204 screens and selling 188,577 admissions. In its opening week it grossed 6,341,843 French franc ($1.1 million). In total the film sold 1,020,679 tickets after its run in French theaters.\n\nCritical response\nFanfan received mixed reviews. In his review in Films de France, James Travers found the first half of the film \"unconvincing and painfully superficial in places,\" but thought the film improved significantly in the second half:\n\nCompelling performances from Vincent Perez and Sophie Marceau transform what looks at first like a routine romantic comedy into something far richer, far more compassionate. The second part of the film also contains some moments of artistic brilliance, notably the Cocteau-esque sequence in which the two lovers attempt to make contact through a mirrored partition. Although there are a few unexplained gaps in the narrative—some more back story about Alexandre might have helped—writer-director Alexandre Jardin succeeds in weaving a tender love story that is both original and hauntingly poetic.\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\nFanfan at IMDb\nFanfan at Rotten Tomatoes\nFanfan at FANFAN.ba accessories",

He is known for his news series Marketing Monday, using his prior experience to give presentations within the marketing and business field to his audience. Ewing is also a former world record holder in speedrunning the video game series Hitman. He began streaming consistently at the beginning of 2020, and has over 730,000 YouTube subscribers and 370,000 Twitch followers as of February 2025.\n\nCareer\nBefore streaming\nDuring college, Ewing was an avid League of Legends player.  While studying at Arizona State University, he founded the university's Esports Club, which he himself attended.\nAfter graduating with a degree in marketing, Ewing started his career at Twitch in February 2014 as a marketing and content manager, before moving on to work under marketing at Nvidia in December 2017.\n\nStreaming career\nEwing is active in the Hitman speedrunning scene and frequently plays with fellow streamers Aspecticor and Linkus7. \nDuring September 2021, Ewing's Twitch account was banned following a Wikipedia race stream, during which the players attempted to navigate from the articles of \"Donald Trump\" to \"Erectile disfunction\". During the game, one of the articles featured a photograph of a penis, which is against Twitch's terms of service surrounding nudity.\nIn 2021, during fellow streamer Valkyrae's controversy surrounding the endorsement of RFLCT, while streaming Ewing unintentionally leaked conversations between Valkyrae and Ludwig about her considerations of leaving RFLCT, but being contractually bound.\nIn 2021, Ewing became the 975th highest-ranked Age of Empires IV player. On the launch day of Elden Ring in early 2022, Ewing gained attention after spending seven hours attempting to beat the second optional boss. \nIn September 2022, Ewing founded the content creation agency Offbrand with Ludwig Ahgren, Nathan Stanz, and Nick Allen.\nDuring a live stream on January 30, 2023, Ewing accidentally revealed a browser tab with a pornographic website selling deepfakes of other live streamers, including Pokimane and QTCinderella. In response to the controversy, Ewing apologized and resigned from Offbrand. QTCinderella described her friendship with him as irreparable following the incident. In the following months, Ewing spent more than USD$100,000 to take down other deepfake porn images across the internet, working with QTCinderella, among others. According to independent analyst Genevieve Oh, web traffic for deepfake pornography exploded after the incident. Following the events, Ewing, with the help of Genevieve Oh, started writing a piece that he hopes to publish with the BBC.\n\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\nExternal links\nAtrioc's channel on YouTube\n Media related to Atrioc at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA ) is an independent agency of the US federal government responsible for the United States's civil space program, aeronautics research and space research. Established in 1958, it succeeded the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the US space development effort a distinct civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science. It has since led most of America's space exploration programs, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968–1972 Apollo program missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA supports the International Space Station (ISS) along with the Commercial Crew Program, and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the lunar Artemis program.\nNASA's science division is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons and planetary rovers such as Perseverance; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the James Webb Space Telescope, the four Great Observatories, and associated programs. The Launch Services Program oversees launch operations for its uncrewed launches.\n\nHistory\nCreation\nNASA traces its roots to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Despite being the birthplace of aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was far behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American leadership in aviation, the United States Congress created the Aviation Section of the US Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established NACA in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development. Over the next forty years, NACA would conduct aeronautical research in support of the US Air Force, US Army, US Navy, and the civil aviation sector. After the end of World War II, NACA became interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic aircraft, developing and testing the Bell X-1 in a joint program with the US Air Force. NACA's interest in space grew out of its rocketry program at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division.\n\nThe Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 ushered in the Space Age and kicked off the Space Race. Despite NACA's early rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first American satellite fell to the Naval Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, whose operational issues ensured the Army Ballistic Missile Agency would launch Explorer 1, America's first satellite, on February 1, 1958.\nThe Eisenhower Administration decided to split the United States's military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized together under the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency. NASA was established on July 29, 1958, with the signing of the National Aeronautics and Space Act and it began operations on October 1, 1958.\nAs the US's premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core of NASA's new structure by reassigning 8,000 employees and three major research laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, the Army's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency under Wernher von Braun. This left NASA firmly as the United States's civil space lead and the Air Force as the military space lead.\n\nFirst orbital and hypersonic flights\nPlans for human spaceflight began in the US Armed Forces prior to NASA's creation. The Air Force's Man in Space Soonest project formed in 1956, coupled with the Army's Project Adam, served as the foundation for Project Mercury. NASA established the Space Task Group to manage the program, which would conduct crewed sub-orbital flights with the Army's Redstone rockets and orbital flights with the Air Force's Atlas launch vehicles. While NASA intended for its first astronauts to be civilians, President Eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military. The Mercury 7 astronauts included three Air Force pilots, three Navy aviators, and one Marine Corps pilot.\n\nOn May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to enter space, performing a suborbital spaceflight in the Freedom 7. This flight occurred less than a month after the Soviet Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, executing a full orbital spaceflight. NASA's first orbital spaceflight was conducted by John Glenn on February 20, 1962, in the Friendship 7, making three full orbits before reentering. Glenn had to fly parts of his final two orbits manually due to an autopilot malfunction. The sixth and final Mercury mission was flown by Gordon Cooper in May 1963, performing 22 orbits over 34 hours in the Faith 7. The Mercury Program was wildly recognized as a resounding success, achieving its objectives to orbit a human in space, develop tracking and control systems, and identify other issues associated with human spaceflight.\nWhile much of NASA's attention turned to space, it did not put aside its aeronautics mission. Early aeronautics research attempted to build upon the X-1's supersonic flight to build an aircraft capable of hypersonic flight. The North American X-15 was a joint NASA–US Air Force program, with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming the first non-dedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to outer space. The X-15 also served as a testbed for Apollo program technologies, as well as ramjet and scramjet propulsion.\n\nMoon landing\nEscalations in the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union prompted President John F. Kennedy to charge NASA with landing an American on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s and installed James E. Webb as NASA administrator to achieve this goal. On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy openly declared this goal in his \"Urgent National Needs\" speech to the United States Congress, declaring:\n\nI believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.\nKennedy gave his \"We choose to go to the Moon\" speech the next year, on September 12, 1962 at Rice University, where he addressed the nation hoping to reinforce public support for the Apollo program.\nDespite attacks on the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon from the former president Dwight Eisenhower and 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, President Kennedy was able to protect NASA's growing budget, of which 50% went directly to human spaceflight and it was later estimated that, at its height, 5% of Americans worked on some aspect of the Apollo program.\n\nMirroring the Department of Defense's program management concept using redundant systems in building the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, NASA requested the Air Force assign Major General Samuel C. Phillips to the space agency where he would serve as the director of the Apollo program. Development of the Saturn V rocket was led by Wernher von Braun and his team at the Marshall Space Flight Center, derived from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's original Saturn I. The Apollo spacecraft was designed and built by North American Aviation, while the Apollo Lunar Module was designed and built by Grumman.\nTo develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar mission, NASA initiated Project Gemini. Using a modified Air Force Titan II launch vehicle, the Gemini capsule could hold two astronauts for flights of over two weeks. Gemini pioneered the use of fuel cells instead of batteries, and conducted the first American spacewalks and rendezvous operations.\n\nThe Ranger Program was started in the 1950s as a response to Soviet lunar exploration, however most missions ended in failure. The Lunar Orbiter program had greater success, mapping the surface in preparation for Apollo landings, conducting meteoroid detection, and measuring radiation levels. The Surveyor program conducted uncrewed lunar landings and takeoffs, as well as taking surface and regolith observations. Despite the setback caused by the Apollo 1 fire, which killed three astronauts, the program proceeded.\nApollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times on December 24 and 25, 1968, and then traveled safely back to Earth. The three Apollo 8 astronauts—Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders—were the first humans to see the Earth as a globe in space, the first to witness an Earthrise, and the first to see and manually photograph the far side of the Moon.\nThe first lunar landing was conducted by Apollo 11. Commanded by Neil Armstrong with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Apollo 11 was one of the most significant missions in NASA's history, marking the end of the Space Race when the Soviet Union gave up its lunar ambitions. As the first human to step on the surface of the Moon, Neil Armstrong uttered the now famous words:\n\nThat's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\nNASA would conduct six total lunar landings as part of the Apollo program, with Apollo 17 concluding the program in 1972.\n\nEnd of Apollo\nWernher von Braun had advocated for NASA to develop a space station since the agency was created. In 1973, following the end of the Apollo lunar missions, NASA launched its first space station, Skylab, on the final launch of the Saturn V. Skylab reused a significant amount of Apollo and Saturn hardware, with a repurposed Saturn V third stage serving as the primary module for the space station. Damage to Skylab during its launch required spacewalks to be performed by the first crew to make it habitable and operational. Skylab hosted nine missions and was decommissioned in 1974 and deorbited in 1979, two years prior to the first launch of the Space Shuttle and any possibility of boosting its orbit.\nIn 1975, the Apollo–Soyuz mission was the first ever international spaceflight and a major diplomatic accomplishment between the Cold War rivals, which also marked the last flight of the Apollo capsule. Flown in 1975, a US Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule.\n\nInterplanetary exploration and space science\nDuring the 1960s, NASA started its space science and interplanetary probe program. The Mariner program was its flagship program, launching probes to Venus, Mars, and Mercury in the 1960s. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory was the lead NASA center for robotic interplanetary exploration, making significant discoveries about the inner planets. Despite these successes, Congress was unwilling to fund further interplanetary missions and NASA Administrator James Webb suspended all future interplanetary probes to focus resources on the Apollo program.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Apollo program, NASA resumed launching interplanetary probes and expanded its space science program. The first planet tagged for exploration was Venus, sharing many similar characteristics to Earth. First visited by American Mariner 2 spacecraft, Venus was observed to be a hot and inhospitable planet. Follow-on missions included the Pioneer Venus project in the 1970s and Magellan, which performed radar mapping of Venus' surface in the 1980s and 1990s. Future missions were flybys of Venus, on their way to other destinations in the Solar System.\nMars has long been a planet of intense fascination for NASA, being suspected of potentially having harbored life. Mariner 5 was the first NASA spacecraft to flyby Mars, followed by Mariner 6 and Mariner 7. Mariner 9 was the first orbital mission to Mars. Launched in 1975, Viking program consisted of two landings on Mars in 1976. Follow-on missions would not be launched until 1996, with the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter and Mars Pathfinder, deploying the first Mars rover, Sojourner. During the early 2000s, the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter reached the planet and in 2004 the Sprit and Opportunity rovers landed on the Red Planet. This was followed in 2005 by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2007 Phoenix Mars lander. The 2012 landing of Curiosity discovered that the radiation levels on Mars were equal to those on the International Space Station, greatly increasing the possibility of Human exploration, and observed the key chemical ingredients for life to occur. In 2013, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission observed the Martian upper atmosphere and space environment and in 2018, the Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) studied the Martian interior. The 2021 Perseverance rover carried the first extraplanetary aircraft, a helicopter named Ingenuity.\nNASA also launched missions to Mercury in 2004, with the MESSENGER probe demonstrating as the first use of a solar sail. NASA also launched probes to the outer Solar System starting in the 1960s. Pioneer 10 was the first probe to the outer planets, flying by Jupiter, while Pioneer 11 provided the first close up view of the planet. Both probes became the first objects to leave the Solar System. The Voyager program launched in 1977, conducting flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus on a trajectory to leave the Solar System. The Galileo spacecraft, deployed from the Space Shuttle flight STS-34, was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, discovering evidence of subsurface oceans on the Europa and observed that the moon may hold ice or liquid water. A joint NASA-European Space Agency-Italian Space Agency mission, Cassini–Huygens, was sent to Saturn's moon Titan, which, along with Mars and Europa, are the only celestial bodies in the Solar System suspected of being capable of harboring life. Cassini discovered three new moons of Saturn and the Huygens probe entered Titan's atmosphere. The mission discovered evidence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan and subsurface water oceans on the moon of Enceladus, which could harbor life. Finally launched in 2006, the New Horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.\nBeyond interplanetary probes, NASA has launched many space telescopes. Launched in the 1960s, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory were NASA's first orbital telescopes, providing ultraviolet, gamma-ray, x-ray, and infrared observations. NASA launched the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory in the 1960s and 1970s to look down at Earth and observe its interactions with the Sun. The Uhuru satellite was the first dedicated x-ray telescope, mapping 85% of the sky and discovering a large number of black holes.\n\nLaunched in the 1990s and early 2000s, the Great Observatories program are among NASA's most powerful telescopes. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990 on STS-31 from the Discovery and could view galaxies 15 billion light years away. A major defect in the telescope's mirror could have crippled the program, had NASA not used computer enhancement to compensate for the imperfection and launched five Space Shuttle servicing flights to replace the damaged components. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was launched from the Atlantis on STS-37 in 1991, discovering a possible source of antimatter at the center of the Milky Way and observing that the majority of gamma-ray bursts occur outside of the Milky Way galaxy. The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched from the Columbia on STS-93 in 1999, observing black holes, quasars, supernova, and dark matter. It provided critical observations on the Sagittarius A* black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and the separation of dark and regular matter during galactic collisions. Finally, the Spitzer Space Telescope is an infrared telescope launched in 2003 from a Delta II rocket. It is in a trailing orbit around the Sun, following the Earth and discovered the existence of brown dwarf stars.\nOther telescopes, such as the Cosmic Background Explorer and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, provided evidence to support the Big Bang. The James Webb Space Telescope, named after the NASA administrator who lead the Apollo program, is an infrared observatory launched in 2021. The James Webb Space Telescope is a direct successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, intended to observe the formation of the first galaxies. Other space telescopes include the Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009 to identify planets orbiting extrasolar stars that may be Terran and possibly harbor life. The first exoplanet that the Kepler space telescope confirmed was Kepler-22b, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star.\nNASA also launched a number of different satellites to study Earth, such as Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) in 1960, which was the first weather satellite. NASA and the United States Weather Bureau cooperated on future TIROS and the second generation Nimbus program of weather satellites. It also worked with the Environmental Science Services Administration on a series of weather satellites and the agency launched its experimental Applications Technology Satellites into geosynchronous orbit. NASA's first dedicated Earth observation satellite, Landsat, was launched in 1972. This led to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration jointly developing the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and discovering Ozone depletion.\n\nSpace Shuttle\nNASA had been pursuing spaceplane development since the 1960s, blending the administration's dual aeronautics and space missions. NASA viewed a spaceplane as part of a larger program, providing routine and economical logistical support to a space station in Earth orbit that would be used as a hub for lunar and Mars missions. A reusable launch vehicle would then have ended the need for expensive and expendable boosters like the Saturn V.\nIn 1969, NASA designated the Johnson Space Center as the lead center for the design, development, and manufacturing of the Space Shuttle orbiter, while the Marshall Space Flight Center would lead the development of the launch system. NASA's series of lifting body aircraft, culminating in the joint NASA-US Air Force Martin Marietta X-24, directly informed the development of the Space Shuttle and future hypersonic flight aircraft. Official development of the Space Shuttle began in 1972, with Rockwell International contracted to design the orbiter and engines, Martin Marietta for the external fuel tank, and Morton Thiokol for the solid rocket boosters. NASA acquired six orbiters: the Enterprise, Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour\nThe Space Shuttle program also allowed NASA to make major changes to its Astronaut Corps. While almost all previous astronauts were Air Force or Naval test pilots, the Space Shuttle allowed NASA to begin recruiting more non-military scientific and technical experts. A prime example is Sally Ride, who became the first American woman to fly in space on STS-7. This new astronaut selection process also allowed NASA to accept exchange astronauts from US allies and partners for the first time.\nThe first Space Shuttle flight occurred in 1981, when the Columbia launched on the STS-1 mission, designed to serve as a flight test for the new spaceplane. NASA intended for the Space Shuttle to replace expendable launch systems like the Air Force's Atlas, Delta, and Titan and the European Space Agency's Ariane. The Space Shuttle's Spacelab payload, developed by the European Space Agency, increased the scientific capabilities of shuttle missions over anything NASA was able to previously accomplish.\n\nNASA launched its first commercial satellites on the STS-5 mission and in 1984, the STS-41-C mission conducted the world's first on-orbit satellite servicing mission when the Challenger captured and repaired the malfunctioning Solar Maximum Mission satellite. It also had the capability to return malfunctioning satellite to Earth, like it did with the Palapa B2 and Westar 6 satellites. Once returned to Earth, the satellites were repaired and relaunched.\nDespite ushering in a new era of spaceflight, where NASA was contracting launch services to commercial companies, the Space Shuttle was criticized for not being as reusable and cost-effective as advertised. In 1986, Challenger disaster on the STS-51L mission resulted in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts on launch, grounding the entire space shuttle fleet for 36 months and forced the 44 commercial companies that contracted with NASA to deploy their satellites to return to expendable launch vehicles. When the Space Shuttle returned to flight with the STS-26 mission, it had undergone significant modifications to improve its reliability and safety.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation and United States initiated the Shuttle-Mir program. The first Russian cosmonaut flew on the STS-60 mission in 1994 and the Discovery rendezvoused, but did not dock with, the Russian Mir in the STS-63 mission. This was followed by Atlantis' STS-71 mission where it accomplished the initial intended mission for the Space Shuttle, docking with a space station and transferring supplies and personnel. The Shuttle-Mir program would continue until 1998, when a series of orbital accidents on the space station spelled an end to the program.\nIn 2003, a second space shuttle was destroyed when the Columbia was destroyed upon reentry during the STS-107 mission, resulting in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts. This accident marked the beginning of the retiring of the Space Shuttle program, with President George W. Bush directing that upon the completion of the International Space Station, the space shuttle be retired. In 2006, the Space Shuttle returned to flight, conducting several mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope, but was retired following the STS-135 resupply mission to the International Space Station in 2011.\n\nSpace stations\nNASA never gave up on the idea of a space station after Skylab's reentry in 1979. The agency began lobbying politicians to support building a larger space station as soon as the Space Shuttle began flying, selling it as an orbital laboratory, repair station, and a jumping off point for lunar and Mars missions. NASA found a strong advocate in President Ronald Reagan, who declared in a 1984 speech:\n\nAmerica has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reach for greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain. Tonight I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade.\nIn 1985, NASA proposed the Space Station Freedom, which both the agency and President Reagan intended to be an international program. While this would add legitimacy to the program, there were concerns within NASA that the international component would dilute its authority within the project, having never been willing to work with domestic or international partners as true equals. There was also a concern with sharing sensitive space technologies with the Europeans, which had the potential to dilute America's technical lead. Ultimately, an international agreement to develop the Space Station Freedom program would be signed with thirteen countries in 1985, including the European Space Agency member states, Canada, and Japan.\nDespite its status as the first international space program, the Space Station Freedom was controversial, with much of the debate centering on cost. Several redesigns to reduce cost were conducted in the early 1990s, stripping away much of its functions. Despite calls for Congress to terminate the program, it continued, in large part because by 1992 it had created 75,000 jobs across 39 states. By 1993, President Bill Clinton attempted to significantly reduce NASA's budget and directed costs be significantly reduced, aerospace industry jobs were not lost, and the Russians be included.\n\nIn 1993, the Clinton Administration announced that the Space Station Freedom would become the International Space Station in an agreement with the Russian Federation. This allowed the Russians to maintain their space program through an infusion of American currency to maintain their status as one of the two premier space programs. While the United States built and launched the majority of the International Space Station, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the European Space Agency all contributed components. Despite NASA's insistence that costs would be kept at a budget of $17.4, they kept rising and NASA had to transfer funds from other programs to keep the International Space Station solvent. Ultimately, the total cost of the station was $150 billion, with the United States paying for two-thirds.Following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA was forced to rely on Russian Soyuz launches for its astronauts and the 2011 retirement of the Space Shuttle accelerated the station's completion.\nIn the 1980s, right after the first flight of the Space Shuttle, NASA started a joint program with the Department of Defense to develop the Rockwell X-30 National Aerospace Plane. NASA realized that the Space Shuttle, while a massive technological accomplishment, would not be able to live up to all its promises. Designed to be a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane, the X-30 had both civil and military applications. With the end of the Cold War, the X-30 was canceled in 1992 before reaching flight status.\n\nUnleashing commercial space and return to the Moon\nFollowing the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, President Bush started the Constellation program to smoothly replace the Space Shuttle and expand space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Constellation was intended to use a significant amount of former Space Shuttle equipment and return astronauts to the Moon. This program was canceled by the Obama Administration. Former astronauts Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan, and Jim Lovell sent a letter to President Barack Obama to warn him that if the United States did not get new human spaceflight ability, the US risked become a second or third-rate space power.\nAs early as the Reagan Administration, there had been calls for NASA to expand private sector involvement in space exploration rather than do it all in-house. In the 1990s, NASA and Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement to develop the Lockheed Martin X-33 demonstrator of the VentureStar spaceplane, which was intended to replace the Space Shuttle. Due to technical challenges, the spacecraft was cancelled in 2001. Despite this, it was the first time a commercial space company directly expended a significant amount of its resources into spacecraft development. The advent of space tourism also forced NASA to challenge its assumption that only governments would have people in space. The first space tourist was Dennis Tito, an American investment manager and former aerospace engineer who contracted with the Russians to fly to the International Space Station for four days, despite the opposition of NASA to the idea.\nAdvocates of this new commercial approach for NASA included former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who remarked that it would return NASA to its roots as a research and development agency, with commercial entities actually operating the space systems. Having corporations take over orbital operations would also allow NASA to focus all its efforts on deep space exploration and returning humans to the Moon and going to Mars. Embracing this approach, NASA's Commercial Crew Program started by contracting cargo delivery to the International Space Station and flew its first operational contracted mission on SpaceX Crew-1. This marked the first time since the retirement of the Space Shuttle that NASA was able to launch its own astronauts on an American spacecraft from the United States, ending a decade of reliance on the Russians.\nIn 2019, NASA announced the Artemis program, intending to return to the Moon and establish a permanent human presence. This was paired with the Artemis Accords with partner nations to establish rules of behavior and norms of space commercialization on the Moon.\nIn 2023, NASA established the Moon to Mars Program office. The office is designed to oversee the various projects, mission architectures and associated timelines relevant to lunar and Mars exploration and science.\n\nActive programs\nHuman spaceflight\nInternational Space Station (1993–present)\nThe International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom project with the Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which were manufactured in various factories around the world and launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the American Space Shuttle. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2009 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment occurred in 2010. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements, which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.\nLong-duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS. The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Between May 2009 and until the retirement of the Space Shuttle, the expedition crew size has been six crew members. As of 2024, though the Commercial Program's crew capsules can allow a crew of up to seven, expeditions using them typically consist of a crew of four. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 24 years and 136 days, having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.\nThe station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2025, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Russian Soyuz and American Dragon and Starliner spacecraft are used to send astronauts to and from the ISS. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the ISS; they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the (uncrewed) Dragon since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011 and the commencement of crewed Dragon flights in 2020, American astronauts exclusively used the Soyuz for crew transport to and from the ISS The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.\nThe ISS program is expected to continue until 2030, after which the space station will be retired and destroyed in a controlled de-orbit.\n\nCommercial Resupply Services (2008–present)\nCommercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a contract solution to deliver cargo and supplies to the International Space Station on a commercial basis by private companies. NASA signed its first CRS contracts in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for twelve cargo Dragon and $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences for eight Cygnus flights, covering deliveries until 2016. Both companies evolved or created their launch vehicle products to launch the spacecrafts (SpaceX with The Falcon 9 and Orbital with the Antares).\nSpaceX flew its first operational resupply mission (SpaceX CRS-1) in 2012. Orbital Sciences followed in 2014 (Cygnus CRS Orb-1). In 2015, NASA extended CRS-1 to twenty flights for SpaceX and twelve flights for Orbital ATK.\nA second phase of contracts (known as CRS-2) was solicited in 2014; contracts were awarded in January 2016 to Orbital ATK Cygnus, Sierra Nevada Corporation Dream Chaser, and SpaceX Dragon 2, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024. In March 2022, NASA awarded an additional six CRS-2 missions each to both SpaceX and Northrop Grumman (formerly Orbital).\nNorthrop Grumman successfully delivered Cygnus NG-17 to the ISS in February 2022. In July 2022, SpaceX launched its 25th CRS flight (SpaceX CRS-25) and successfully delivered its cargo to the ISS. The Dream Chaser spacecraft is currently scheduled for its Demo-1 launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nCommercial Crew Program (2011–present)\nThe Commercial Crew Program (CCP) provides commercially operated crew transportation service to and from the International Space Station (ISS) under contract to NASA, conducting crew rotations between the expeditions of the International Space Station program. American space manufacturer SpaceX began providing service in 2020, using the Crew Dragon spacecraft, while Boeing's Starliner spacecraft began providing service in 2024. NASA has contracted for six operational missions from Boeing and fourteen from SpaceX, ensuring sufficient support for ISS through 2030.\nThe spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor, and crew transportation is provided to NASA as a commercial service. Each mission sends up to four astronauts to the ISS, with an option for a fifth passenger available. Operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months. A spacecraft remains docked to the ISS during its mission, and missions usually overlap by at least a few days. Between the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 and the first operational CCP mission in 2020, NASA relied on the Soyuz program to transport its astronauts to the ISS.\nA Crew Dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle and the capsule returns to Earth via splashdown in the ocean near Florida. The program's first operational mission, SpaceX Crew-1, launched on November 16, 2020. Boeing Starliner operational flights will now commence with Boeing Starliner-1 which will launched atop an Atlas V N22 launch vehicle. Instead of a splashdown, Starliner capsules return on land with airbags at one of four designated sites in the western United States.\n\nArtemis (2017–present)\nSince 2017, NASA's crewed spaceflight program has been the Artemis program, which involves the help of US commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as ESA, JAXA, and CSA. The goal of this program is to land \"the first woman and the next man\" on the lunar south pole region by 2025. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars.\nThe Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle was held over from the canceled Constellation program for Artemis. Artemis I was the uncrewed initial launch of Space Launch System (SLS) that would also send an Orion spacecraft on a Distant Retrograde Orbit.\nThe first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be Artemis II, which is to include the Orion crew module, propelled by the SLS, and is to launch in 2025. This mission is to be a 10-day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into a Lunar flyby. Artemis III aims to conduct the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17, and is scheduled for no earlier than September 2026.\nIn support of the Artemis missions, NASA has been funding private companies to land robotic probes on the lunar surface in a program known as the Commercial Lunar Payload Services. As of March 2022, NASA has awarded contracts for robotic lunar probes to companies such as Intuitive Machines, Firefly Space Systems, and Astrobotic.\nOn April 16, 2021, NASA announced they had selected the SpaceX Lunar Starship as its Human Landing System. The agency's Space Launch System rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft for their multi-day journey to lunar orbit where they will transfer to SpaceX's Starship for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the Moon.\nIn November 2021, it was announced that the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2024 had slipped to no earlier than 2025 due to numerous factors. Artemis I launched on November 16, 2022, and returned to Earth safely on December 11, 2022. As of April 2024, NASA plans to launch Artemis II in September 2025 and Artemis III in September 2026. Additional Artemis missions, Artemis IV, Artemis V, and Artemis VI are planned to launch between 2028 and 2031.\nNASA's next major space initiative is the construction of the Lunar Gateway, a small space station in lunar orbit. This space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation. The construction of the Gateway is expected to begin in 2027 with the launch of the first two modules: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO). Operations on the Gateway will begin with the Artemis IV mission, which plans to deliver a crew of four to the Gateway in 2028.\nIn 2017, NASA was directed by the congressional NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 to get humans to Mars-orbit (or to the Martian surface) by the 2030s.\n\nCommercial LEO Development (2021–present)\nThe Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations program is an initiative by NASA to support work on commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to replace the \"International Space Station\". The three selected companies are: Blue Origin (et al.) with their Orbital Reef station concept, Nanoracks (et al.) with their Starlab Space Station concept, and Northrop Grumman with a station concept based on the HALO-module for the Gateway station.\n\nRobotic exploration\nNASA has conducted many uncrewed and robotic spaceflight programs throughout its history. More than 1,000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the Solar System.\n\nMission selection process\nNASA executes a mission development framework to plan, select, develop, and operate robotic missions. This framework defines cost, schedule and technical risk parameters to enable competitive selection of missions involving mission candidates that have been developed by principal investigators and their teams from across NASA, the broader US Government research and development stakeholders, and industry. The mission development construct is defined by four umbrella programs.\n\nExplorer program\nThe Explorer program derives its origin from the earliest days of the US Space program. In current form, the program consists of three classes of systems – Small Explorers (SMEX), Medium Explorers (MIDEX), and University-Class Explorers (UNEX) missions. The NASA Explorer program office provides frequent flight opportunities for moderate cost innovative solutions from the heliophysics and astrophysics science areas. The Small Explorer missions are required to limit cost to NASA to below $150M (2022 dollars). Medium class explorer missions have typically involved NASA cost caps of $350M. The Explorer program office is based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nDiscovery program\nThe NASA Discovery program develops and delivers robotic spacecraft solutions in the planetary science domain. Discovery enables scientists and engineers to assemble a team to deliver a solution against a defined set of objectives and competitively bid that solution against other candidate programs. Cost caps vary but recent mission selection processes were accomplished using a $500M cost cap for NASA. The Planetary Mission Program Office is based at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and manages both the Discovery and New Frontiers missions. The office is part of the Science Mission Directorate.\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced on June 2, 2021, that the DAVINCI+ and VERITAS missions were selected to launch to Venus in the late 2020s, having beat out competing proposals for missions to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io and Neptune's large moon Triton that were also selected as Discovery program finalists in early 2020. Each mission has an estimated cost of $500 million, with launches expected between 2028 and 2030. Launch contracts will be awarded later in each mission's development.\n\nNew Frontiers program\nThe New Frontiers program focuses on specific Solar System exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Primary objectives include Solar System exploration employing medium class spacecraft missions to conduct high-science-return investigations. New Frontiers builds on the development approach employed by the Discovery program but provides for higher cost caps and schedule durations than are available with Discovery. Cost caps vary by opportunity; recent missions have been awarded based on a defined cap of $1 billion. The higher cost cap and projected longer mission durations result in a lower frequency of new opportunities for the program – typically one every several years. OSIRIS-REx and New Horizons are examples of New Frontiers missions.\nNASA has determined that the next opportunity to propose for the fifth round of New Frontiers missions will occur no later than the fall of 2024. Missions in NASA's New Frontiers Program tackle specific Solar System exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Exploring the Solar System with medium-class spacecraft missions that conduct high-science-return investigations is NASA's strategy to further understand the Solar System.\n\nLarge strategic missions\nLarge strategic missions (formerly called Flagship missions) are strategic missions that are typically developed and managed by large teams that may span several NASA centers. The individual missions become the program as opposed to being part of a larger effort (see Discovery, New Frontiers, etc.). The James Webb Space Telescope is a strategic mission that was developed over a period of more than 20 years. Strategic missions are developed on an ad-hoc basis as program objectives and priorities are established. Missions like Voyager, had they been developed today, would have been strategic missions. Three of the Great Observatories were strategic missions (the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the Hubble Space Telescope). Europa Clipper is the next large strategic mission in development by NASA.\n\nPlanetary science missions\nNASA continues to play a material role in exploration of the Solar System as it has for decades. Ongoing missions have current science objectives with respect to more than five extraterrestrial bodies within the Solar System – Moon (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter), Mars (Perseverance rover), Jupiter (Juno), asteroid Bennu (OSIRIS-REx), and Kuiper Belt Objects (New Horizons). The Juno extended mission will make multiple flybys of the Jovian moon Io in 2023 and 2024 after flybys of Ganymede in 2021 and Europa in 2022. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue to provide science data back to Earth while continuing on their outward journeys into interstellar space.\nOn November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission was successfully launched for Mars. The Curiosity rover successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.\nIn September 2014, NASA's MAVEN spacecraft, which is part of the Mars Scout Program, successfully entered Mars orbit and, as of October 2022, continues its study of the atmosphere of Mars. NASA's ongoing Mars investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars by the Perseverance rover.\nNASA's Europa Clipper, launched in October 2024, will study the Galilean moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. Dragonfly will send a mobile robotic rotorcraft to Saturn's biggest moon, Titan. As of May 2021, Dragonfly is scheduled for launch in June 2027.\n\nAstrophysics missions\nThe NASA Science Mission Directorate Astrophysics division manages the agency's astrophysics science portfolio. NASA has invested significant resources in the development, delivery, and operations of various forms of space telescopes. These telescopes have provided the means to study the cosmos over a large range of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe Great Observatories that were launched in the 1980s and 1990s have provided a wealth of observations for study by physicists across the planent. The first of them, the Hubble Space Telescope, was delivered to orbit in 1990 and continues to function, in part due to prior servicing missions performed by the Space Shuttle. The other remaining active great observatories include the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), launched by STS-93 in July 1999 and is now in a 64-hour elliptical orbit studying X-ray sources that are not readily viewable from terrestrial observatories.\n\nThe Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) is a space observatory designed to improve the understanding of X-ray production in objects such as neutron stars and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as stellar and supermassive black holes. IXPE launched in December 2021 and is an international collaboration between NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). It is part of the NASA Small Explorers program (SMEX) which designs low-cost spacecraft to study heliophysics and astrophysics.\nThe Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was launched in November 2004 and is a gamma-ray burst observatory that also monitors the afterglow in X-ray, and UV/Visible light at the location of a burst. The mission was developed in a joint partnership between Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and an international consortium from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. Pennsylvania State University operates the mission as part of NASA's Medium Explorer program (MIDEX).\nThe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) is another gamma-ray focused space observatory that was launched to low Earth orbit in June 2008 and is being used to perform gamma-ray astronomy observations. In addition to NASA, the mission involves the United States Department of Energy, and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket, operates in a halo orbit circling the Sun-Earth L2 point. JWST's high sensitivity in the infrared spectrum and its imaging resolution will allow it to view more distant, faint, or older objects than its predecessors, including Hubble.\n\nEarth Sciences Program missions (1965–present)\nNASA Earth Science is a large, umbrella program comprising a range of terrestrial and space-based collection systems in order to better understand the Earth system and its response to natural and human-caused changes. Numerous systems have been developed and fielded over several decades to provide improved prediction for weather, climate, and other changes in the natural environment. Several of the current operating spacecraft programs include: Aqua, Aura, Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-on (GRACE FO), and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2).\nIn addition to systems already in orbit, NASA is designing a new set of Earth Observing Systems to study, assess, and generate responses for climate change, natural hazards, forest fires, and real-time agricultural processes. The GOES-T satellite (designated GOES-18 after launch) joined the fleet of US geostationary weather monitoring satellites in March 2022.\nNASA also maintains the Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program to oversee the life cycle of NASA's Earth science data – from acquisition through processing and distribution. The primary goal of ESDS is to maximize the scientific return from NASA's missions and experiments for research and applied scientists, decision makers, and society at large.\nThe Earth Science program is managed by the Earth Science Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.\n\nSpace operations architecture\nNASA invests in various ground and space-based infrastructures to support its science and exploration mandate. The agency maintains access to suborbital and orbital space launch capabilities and sustains ground station solutions to support its evolving fleet of spacecraft and remote systems.\n\nDeep Space Network (1963–present)\nThe NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) serves as the primary ground station solution for NASA's interplanetary spacecraft and select Earth-orbiting missions. The system employs ground station complexes near Barstow, California, in Spain near Madrid, and in Australia near Canberra. The placement of these ground stations approximately 120 degrees apart around the planet provides the ability for communications to spacecraft throughout the Solar System even as the Earth rotates about its axis on a daily basis. The system is controlled at a 24x7 operations center at JPL in Pasadena, California, which manages recurring communications linkages with up to 40 spacecraft. The system is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNear Space Network (1983–present)\nThe Near Space Network (NSN) provides telemetry, commanding, ground-based tracking, data and communications services to a wide range of customers with satellites in low earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO), highly elliptical orbits (HEO), and lunar orbits. The NSN accumulates ground station and antenna assets from the Near-Earth Network and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRS) which operates in geosynchronous orbit providing continuous real-time coverage for launch vehicles and low earth orbit NASA missions.\nThe NSN consists of 19 ground stations worldwide operated by the US Government and by contractors including Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), and South African National Space Agency (SANSA). The ground network averages between 120 and 150 spacecraft contacts a day with TDRS engaging with systems on a near-continuous basis as needed; the system is managed and operated by the Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nSounding Rocket Program (1959–present)\nThe NASA Sounding Rocket Program (NSRP) is located at the Wallops Flight Facility and provides launch capability, payload development and integration, and field operations support to execute suborbital missions. The program has been in operation since 1959 and is managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center using a combined US Government and contractor team. The NSRP team conducts approximately 20 missions per year from both Wallops and other launch locations worldwide to allow scientists to collect data \"where it occurs\". The program supports the strategic vision of the Science Mission Directorate collecting important scientific data for earth science, heliophysics, and astrophysics programs.\nIn June 2022, NASA conducted its first rocket launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US. It launched a Black Brant IX from the Arnhem Space Centre in Australia.\n\nLaunch Services Program (1990–present)\nThe NASA Launch Services Program (LSP) is responsible for procurement of launch services for NASA uncrewed missions and oversight of launch integration and launch preparation activity, providing added quality and mission assurance to meet program objectives. Since 1990, NASA has purchased expendable launch vehicle launch services directly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and applications missions. Expendable launch vehicles can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and altitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary missions. LSP operates from Kennedy Space Center and falls under the NASA Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD).\n\nAeronautics Research\nThe Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is one of five mission directorates within NASA, the other four being the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, the Space Operations Mission Directorate, the Science Mission Directorate, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate. The ARMD is responsible for NASA's aeronautical research, which benefits the commercial, military, and general aviation sectors. ARMD performs its aeronautics research at four NASA facilities: Ames Research Center and Armstrong Flight Research Center in California, Glenn Research Center in Ohio, and Langley Research Center in Virginia.\n\nNASA X-57 Maxwell aircraft (2016–present)\nThe NASA X-57 Maxwell is an experimental aircraft being developed by NASA to demonstrate the technologies required to deliver a highly efficient all-electric aircraft. The primary goal of the program is to develop and deliver all-electric technology solutions that can also achieve airworthiness certification with regulators. The program involves development of the system in several phases, or modifications, to incrementally grow the capability and operability of the system. The initial configuration of the aircraft has now completed ground testing as it approaches its first flights. In mid-2022, the X-57 was scheduled to fly before the end of the year. The development team includes staff from the NASA Armstrong, Glenn, and Langley centers along with number of industry partners from the United States and Italy.\n\nNext Generation Air Transportation System (2007–present)\nNASA is collaborating with the Federal Aviation Administration and industry stakeholders to modernize the United States National Airspace System (NAS). Efforts began in 2007 with a goal to deliver major modernization components by 2025. The modernization effort intends to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the environmental impact of aviation. The Aviation Systems Division of NASA Ames operates the joint NASA/FAA North Texas Research Station. The station supports all phases of NextGen research, from concept development to prototype system field evaluation. This facility has already transitioned advanced NextGen concepts and technologies to use through technology transfers to the FAA. NASA contributions also include development of advanced automation concepts and tools that provide air traffic controllers, pilots, and other airspace users with more accurate real-time information about the nation's traffic flow, weather, and routing. Ames' advanced airspace modeling and simulation tools have been used extensively to model the flow of air traffic flow across the US, and to evaluate new concepts in airspace design, traffic flow management, and optimization.\n\nTechnology research\nNuclear in-space power and propulsion (ongoing)\nNASA has made use of technologies such as the multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG), which is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator used to power spacecraft. Shortages of the required plutonium-238 have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennium. An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.\nIn July 2021, NASA announced contract awards for development of nuclear thermal propulsion reactors. Three contractors will develop individual designs over 12 months for later evaluation by NASA and the US Department of Energy. NASA's space nuclear technologies portfolio are led and funded by its Space Technology Mission Directorate.\nIn January 2023, NASA announced a partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program to demonstrate a NTR engine in space, an enabling capability for NASA missions to Mars. In July 2023, NASA and DARPA jointly announced the award of $499 million to Lockheed Martin to design and build an experimental NTR rocket to be launched in 2027.\n\nOther initiatives\nFree Space Optics. NASA contracted a third party to study the probability of using Free Space Optics (FSO) to communicate with Optical (laser) Stations on the Ground (OGS) called laser-com RF networks for satellite communications.\nWater Extraction from Lunar Soil. On July 29, 2020, NASA requested American universities to propose new technologies for extracting water from the lunar soil and developing power systems. The idea will help the space agency conduct sustainable exploration of the Moon.\nIn 2024, NASA was tasked by the US Government to create a Time standard for the Moon. The standard is to be called Coordinated Lunar Time and is expected to be finalized in 2026.\n\nHuman Spaceflight Research (2005–present)\nNASA's Human Research Program (HRP) is designed to study the effects of space on human health and also to provide countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration. The medical effects of space exploration are reasonably limited in low Earth orbit or in travel to the Moon. Travel to Mars is significantly longer and deeper into space, significant medical issues can result. These include bone density loss, radiation exposure, vision changes, circadian rhythm disturbances, heart remodeling, and immune alterations. In order to study and diagnose these ill-effects, HRP has been tasked with identifying or developing small portable instrumentation with low mass, volume, and power to monitor the health of astronauts. To achieve this aim, on May 13, 2022, NASA and SpaceX Crew-4 astronauts successfully tested its rHEALTH ONE universal biomedical analyzer for its ability to identify and analyzer biomarkers, cells, microorganisms, and proteins in a spaceflight environment.\n\nPlanetary Defense (2016–present)\nNASA established the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) in 2016 to catalog and track potentially hazardous near-Earth objects (NEO), such as asteroids and comets and develop potential responses and defenses against these threats. The PDCO is chartered to provide timely and accurate information to the government and the public on close approaches by Potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) and any potential for impact. The office functions within the Science Mission Directorate Planetary Science Division.\nThe PDCO augmented prior cooperative actions between the United States, the European Union, and other nations which had been scanning the sky for NEOs since 1998 in an effort called Spaceguard.\n\nNear Earth object detection (1998–present)\nFrom the 1990s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. Many asteroids are very dark and those near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the Sun. NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a \"full Moon\" when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun.\nIn 1998, the United States Congress gave NASA a mandate to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1 km (0.62 mi) diameter (that threaten global devastation) by 2008. This initial mandate was met by 2011. In 2005, the original USA Spaceguard mandate was extended by the George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act, which calls for NASA to detect 90% of NEOs with diameters of 140 m (460 ft) or greater, by 2020 (compare to the 20-meter Chelyabinsk meteor that hit Russia in 2013). As of January 2020, it is estimated that less than half of these have been found, but objects of this size hit the Earth only about once in 2,000 years.\nIn January 2020, NASA officials estimated it would take 30 years to find all objects meeting the 140 m (460 ft) size criteria, more than twice the timeframe that was built into the 2005 mandate. In June 2021, NASA authorized the development of the NEO Surveyor spacecraft to reduce that projected duration to achieve the mandate down to 10 years.\n\nInvolvement in current robotic missions\nNASA has incorporated planetary defense objectives into several ongoing missions.\nIn 1999, NASA visited 433 Eros with the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time. NEAR Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid, improving our understanding of these bodies and demonstrating our capacity to study them in greater detail.\nOSIRIS-REx used its suite of instruments to transmit radio tracking signals and capture optical images of Bennu during its study of the asteroid that will help NASA scientists determine its precise position in the solar system and its exact orbital path. As Bennu has the potential for recurring approaches to the Earth-Moon system in the next 100–200 years, the precision gained from OSIRIS-REx will enable scientists to better predict the future gravitational interactions between Bennu and our planet and resultant changes in Bennu's onward flight path.\nThe WISE/NEOWISE mission was launched by NASA JPL in 2009 as an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. In 2013, NASA repurposed it as the NEOWISE mission to find potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets; its mission has been extended into 2023.\nNASA and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHAPL) jointly developed the first planetary defense purpose-built satellite, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) to test possible planetary defense concepts. DART was launched in November 2021 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 from California on a trajectory designed to impact the Dimorphos asteroid. Scientists were seeking to determine whether an impact could alter the subsequent path of the asteroid; a concept that could be applied to future planetary defense. On September 26, 2022, DART hit its target. In the weeks following impact, NASA declared DART a success, confirming it had shortened Dimorphos' orbital period around Didymos by about 32 minutes, surpassing the pre-defined success threshold of 73 seconds.\nNEO Surveyor, formerly called the Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) mission, is a space-based infrared telescope under development to survey the Solar System for potentially hazardous asteroids. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2026.\n\nStudy of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (2022–present)\nIn June 2022, the head of the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Thomas Zurbuchen, confirmed the start of NASA's UAP independent study team. At a speech before the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, Zurbuchen said the space agency would bring a scientific perspective to efforts already underway by the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to make sense of dozens of such sightings. He said it was \"high-risk, high-impact\" research that the space agency should not shy away from, even if it is a controversial field of study.\n\nCollaboration\nNASA Advisory Council\nIn response to the Apollo 1 accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's air and space programs. In the aftermath of the Shuttle Columbia disaster, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC). The NASA Authorization Act of 2014 reaffirmed the importance of ASAP.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nNASA and NOAA have cooperated for decades on the development, delivery and operation of polar and geosynchronous weather satellites. The relationship typically involves NASA developing the space systems, launch solutions, and ground control technology for the satellites and NOAA operating the systems and delivering weather forecasting products to users. Multiple generations of NOAA Polar orbiting platforms have operated to provide detailed imaging of weather from low altitude. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) provide near-real-time coverage of the western hemisphere to ensure accurate and timely understanding of developing weather phenomenon.\n\nUnited States Space Force\nThe United States Space Force (USSF) is the space service branch of the United States Armed Forces, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for civil spaceflight. NASA and the Space Force's predecessors in the Air Force have a long-standing cooperative relationship, with the Space Force supporting NASA launches out of Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, and Vandenberg Space Force Base, to include range support and rescue operations from Task Force 45. NASA and the Space Force also partner on matters such as defending Earth from asteroids. Space Force members can be NASA astronauts, with Colonel Michael S. Hopkins, the commander of SpaceX Crew-1, commissioned into the Space Force from the International Space Station on December 18, 2020. In September 2020, the Space Force and NASA signed a memorandum of understanding formally acknowledging the joint role of both agencies. This new memorandum replaced a similar document signed in 2006 between NASA and Air Force Space Command.\n\nUS Geological Survey\nThe Landsat program is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. It is a joint NASA / USGS program. On July 23, 1972, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched. This was eventually renamed to Landsat 1 in 1975. The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, was launched on September 27, 2021.\nThe instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the United States and at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance and education, and can be viewed through the US Geological Survey (USGS) \"EarthExplorer\" website. The collaboration between NASA and USGS involves NASA designing and delivering the space system (satellite) solution, launching the satellite into orbit with the USGS operating the system once in orbit. As of October 2022, nine satellites have been built with eight of them successfully operating in orbit.\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA)\nNASA collaborates with the European Space Agency on a wide range of scientific and exploration requirements. From participation with the Space Shuttle (the Spacelab missions) to major roles on the Artemis program (the Orion Service Module), ESA and NASA have supported the science and exploration missions of each agency. There are NASA payloads on ESA spacecraft and ESA payloads on NASA spacecraft. The agencies have developed joint missions in areas including heliophysics (e.g. Solar Orbiter) and astronomy (Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope).\nUnder the Artemis Gateway partnership, ESA will contribute habitation and refueling modules, along with enhanced lunar communications, to the Gateway. NASA and ESA continue to advance cooperation in relation to Earth Science including climate change with agreements to cooperate on various missions including the Sentinel-6 series of spacecraft\n\nJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)\nNASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) cooperate on a range of space projects. JAXA is a direct participant in the Artemis program, including the Lunar Gateway effort. JAXA's planned contributions to Gateway include I-Hab's environmental control and life support system, batteries, thermal control, and imagery components, which will be integrated into the module by the European Space Agency (ESA) prior to launch. These capabilities are critical for sustained Gateway operations during crewed and uncrewed time periods.\nJAXA and NASA have collaborated on numerous satellite programs, especially in areas of Earth science. NASA has contributed to JAXA satellites and vice versa. Japanese instruments are flying on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, and NASA sensors have flown on previous Japanese Earth-observation missions. The NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement mission was launched in 2014 and includes both NASA- and JAXA-supplied sensors on a NASA satellite launched on a JAXA rocket. The mission provides the frequent, accurate measurements of rainfall over the entire globe for use by scientists and weather forecasters.\n\nRoscosmos\nNASA and Roscosmos have cooperated on the development and operation of the International Space Station since September 1993. The agencies have used launch systems from both countries to deliver station elements to orbit. Astronauts and Cosmonauts jointly maintain various elements of the station. Both countries provide access to the station via launch systems noting Russia's unique role as the sole provider of delivery of crew and cargo upon retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and prior to commencement of NASA COTS and crew flights. In July 2022, NASA and Roscosmos signed a deal to share space station flights enabling crew from each country to ride on the systems provided by the other. Current geopolitical conditions in late 2022 make it unlikely that cooperation will be extended to other programs such as Artemis or lunar exploration.\n\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\nIn September 2014, NASA and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) signed a partnership to collaborate on and launch a joint radar mission, the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperature Radar (NISAR) mission. The mission is targeted to launch in 2024. NASA will provide the mission's L-band synthetic aperture radar, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder and payload data subsystem. ISRO provides the spacecraft bus, the S-band radar, the launch vehicle and associated launch services.\n\nArtemis Accords\nThe Artemis Accords have been established to define a framework for cooperating in the peaceful exploration and exploitation of the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and comets. The accords were drafted by NASA and the US State Department and are executed as a series of bilateral agreements between the United States and the participating countries. As of September 2022, 21 countries have signed the accords. They are Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nChina National Space Administration\nThe Wolf Amendment was passed by the US Congress into law in 2011 and prevents NASA from engaging in direct, bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government and China-affiliated organizations such as the China National Space Administration without the explicit authorization from Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The law has been renewed annually since by inclusion in annual appropriations bills.\n\nManagement\nLeadership\nThe agency's administration is located at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, and provides overall guidance and direction. Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be US citizens.\nNASA's administrator is nominated by the President of the United States subject to the approval of the US Senate, and serves at the President's pleasure as a senior space science advisor. The current administrator is Janet Petro, appointed as acting administrator by President Donald Trump, since January 20, 2025. The Trump administration has also nominated Jared Isaacman as official administrator of NASA; however, Senate has yet to confirm him to the position.\n\nStrategic plan\nNASA operates with four FY2022 strategic goals.\n\nExpand human knowledge through new scientific discoveries\nExtend human presence to the Moon and on towards Mars for sustainable long-term exploration, development, and utilization\nCatalyze economic growth and drive innovation to address national challenges\nEnhance capabilities and operations to catalyze current and future mission success\n\nBudget\nNASA budget requests are developed by NASA and approved by the administration prior to submission to the US Congress. Authorized budgets are those that have been included in enacted appropriations bills that are approved by both houses of Congress and enacted into law by the US president.\nNASA fiscal year budget requests and authorized budgets are listed below.\n\nOrganization\nNASA funding and priorities are developed through its six Mission Directorates.\n\nCenter-wide activities such as the Chief Engineer and Safety and Mission Assurance organizations are aligned to the headquarters function. The MSD budget estimate includes funds for these HQ functions. The administration operates 10 major field centers with several managing additional subordinate facilities across the country. Each center is led by a director (data below valid as of December 23, 2024).\n\nSustainability\nEnvironmental impact\nThe exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems, both in Earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely affect the Earth's environment. Some hypergolic rocket propellants, such as hydrazine, are highly toxic prior to combustion, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust. Carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed 803 million US gal (3.0 million m3) of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single Falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25,000 US gallons (95 m3) of kerosene fuel per launch. Even if a Falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust from LOx- and LH2- fueled engines, like the SSME, is almost entirely water vapor. NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled Constellation program in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2011. In contrast, ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion.\nAn example of NASA's environmental efforts is the NASA Sustainability Base. Additionally, the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED Gold rating in 2010. On May 8, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities—the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.\nIn 2018, NASA along with other companies including Sensor Coating Systems, Pratt & Whitney, Monitor Coating and UTRC launched the project CAUTION (CoAtings for Ultra High Temperature detectION). This project aims to enhance the temperature range of the Thermal History Coating up to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) and beyond. The final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nClimate change\nNASA also researches and publishes on climate change. Its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the climate is warming. Bob Walker, who has advised former US President Donald Trump on space issues, has advocated that NASA should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as NOAA. Former NASA atmospheric scientist J. Marshall Shepherd countered that Earth science study was built into NASA's mission at its creation in the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act. NASA won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Green in the category Web.\n\nSTEM Initiatives\nEducational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa). Since 2011, the ELaNa program has provided opportunities for NASA to work with university teams to test emerging technologies and commercial-off-the-shelf solutions by providing launch opportunities for developed CubeSats using NASA procured launch opportunities. By example, two NASA-sponsored CubeSats launched in June 2022 on a Virgin Orbit LauncherOne vehicle as the ELaNa 39 mission.\nCubes in Space. NASA started an annual competition in 2014 named \"Cubes in Space\". It is jointly organized by NASA and the global education company I Doodle Learning, with the objective of teaching school students aged 11–18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017, the world's smallest satellite, KalamSAT, was launched.\n\nUse of the metric system\nUS law requires the International System of Units to be used in all US Government programs, \"except where impractical\".\nIn 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the Moon using a mix of United States customary units and metric units. In the 1980s, NASA started the transition towards the metric system, but was still using both systems in the 1990s. On September 23, 1999, a mixup between NASA's use of SI units and Lockheed Martin Space's use of US units resulted in the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter.\nIn August 2007, NASA stated that all future missions and explorations of the Moon would be done entirely using the SI system. This was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries that already use the metric system. As of 2007, NASA is predominantly working with SI units, but some projects still use US units, and some, including the International Space Station, use a mix of both.\n\nMedia presence\nNASA TV\nApproaching 40 years of service, the NASA TV channel airs content ranging from live coverage of crewed missions to video coverage of significant milestones for operating robotic spacecraft (e.g. rover landings on Mars) and domestic and international launches. The channel is delivered by NASA and is broadcast by satellite and over the Internet. The system initially started to capture archival footage of important space events for NASA managers and engineers and expanded as public interest grew. The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve broadcast while in orbit around the Moon was received by more than a billion people. NASA's video transmission of the Apollo 11 Moon landing was awarded a primetime Emmy in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the landing. The channel is a product of the US Government and is widely available across many television and Internet platforms.\n\nNASAcast\nNASAcast is the official audio and video podcast of the NASA website. Created in late 2005, the podcast service contains the latest audio and video features from the NASA web site, including NASA TV's This Week at NASA and educational materials produced by NASA. Additional NASA podcasts, such as Science@NASA, are also featured and give subscribers an in-depth look at content by subject matter.\n\nNASA EDGE\nNASA EDGE is a video podcast which explores different missions, technologies and projects developed by NASA. The program was released by NASA on March 18, 2007, and, as of August 2020, there have been 200 vodcasts produced. It is a public outreach vodcast sponsored by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and based out of the Exploration and Space Operations Directorate at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The NASA EDGE team takes an insider's look at current projects and technologies from NASA facilities around the United States, and it is depicted through personal interviews, on-scene broadcasts, computer animations, and personal interviews with top scientists and engineers at NASA.\nThe show explores the contributions NASA has made to society as well as the progress of current projects in materials and space exploration. NASA EDGE vodcasts can be downloaded from the NASA website and from iTunes.\nIn its first year of production, the show was downloaded over 450,000 times. As of February 2010, the average download rate is more than 420,000 per month, with over one million downloads in December 2009 and January 2010.\nNASA and the NASA EDGE have also developed interactive programs designed to complement the vodcast. The Lunar Electric Rover App allows users to drive a simulated Lunar Electric Rover between objectives, and it provides information about and images of the vehicle. The NASA EDGE Widget provides a graphical user interface for accessing NASA EDGE vodcasts, image galleries, and the program's Twitter feed, as well as a live NASA news feed.\n\nAstronomy Picture of the Day\nNASA+\nIn July 2023, NASA announced a new streaming service known as NASA+. It launched on November 8, 2023, and has live coverage of launches, documentaries and original programs. According to NASA, it will be free of ads and subscription fees. It will be a part of the NASA app on iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV as well as on the web on desktop and mobile devices.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of crewed spacecraft\nList of NASA aircraft\nList of space disasters\nList of United States rockets\nCategory: NASA people\nNASA Advanced Space Transportation Program\nNASA Art Program\nNASA Clean Air Study – 1989 study of plants removing air pollutants\nNASA Institute for Advanced Concepts – NASA program\nNASA Research Park – Research park near San Jose, California\nTechPort (NASA) – Technology Portfolio System\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAlexander, Joseph K.

        "content": "Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise's primary target audience is children aged 5 to 12, but it is known to attract people of all ages.\nThe franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on 27 February 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed \"Pokémania\". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.\nPokémon has an uncommon ownership structure. Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established the Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, the Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside Asia.\n\nName\nThe original full name of the franchise is Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā), which has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン) since its launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the e to aid in pronunciation. As a Japanese word composed of English loanwords, the word Pokémon is an example of a wasei-eigo.: 30 \nPokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe. As a noun, it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say \"one Pokémon\" and \"many Pokémon\", as well as \"one Pikachu\" and \"many Pikachu\".\n\nGeneral concept\nThe Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon. Pokémon Red and Blue contain 151 Pokémon species, with new ones being added in subsequent games; as of January 2024, 1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced. Most Pokémon are inspired by real-world animals or mythical creatures based on real-life folklore. For example, Pikachu are a yellow, mouse-like species with tails shaped as lightning bolts, able to blast powerful electric jolts through the air.\nThe player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete their Pokédex; and train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in Pokémon battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. Once the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is under the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore. Pokémon never die in battle – they faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Pokémon Center.\nWhen a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points. After gaining a certain amount of them, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle. Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called Pokémon evolution, and transform into stronger forms. Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item or trading with another trainer.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri was born on 28 August 1965, and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo. As a child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town. During Japan's economic miracle, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior high school, an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology, Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time. He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17. At the time, magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the market. Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator. Game Freak folded in the late 1980s, by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game industry.\nTajiri's knowledge of video games brought him into contact with Tsunekazu Ishihara. Ishihara had studied Arts and Science at Tsukuba University, and was trained in CGI. After working in advertising for two years, Ishihara joined a company named Sedic in 1983, which created video graphics and software, including one video game, Otocky (1987). As video games grew in popularity, Sedic also produced a number of game-related television shows for Fuji Television's late-night slot. In his job as a TV producer, Ishihara befriended Tajiri, as well as Shigesato Itoi, who would later become CEO of Ape, Inc. Ishihara was also the general director of the world's first gaming encyclopedia: TV Games: Encyclopedia of Video Games (テレビゲーム―電視遊戯大全, Terebigēmu ― Denshi Yūgi Taizen). Kenji Hatakeyama & Masakazu Kubo (2000) wrote that, at the time, Ishihara was probably the most well-connected man in the industry, with a knowledge of games \"beyond comparison\". Ishihara was also interested in playing cards, and contributed to the development of at least three simple card games designed by Itoi and published by Ape.\nIn 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a few other enthusiasts started an informal development team called Game Freak, named after the magazine it grew out of. Over the next few years, they independently developed the puzzle game Quinty, working on it alongside school or their regular jobs. However, no one within the group knew how to make the game's music. After consulting all his contacts, Tajiri got in touch with Junichi Masuda, who became the group's composer. Quinty was finished in 1989, and published by Namco. Tajiri officially incorporated Game Freak Co., Ltd. on 26 April 1989.\n\n1989–1995: Development of Red and Green\nTajiri started to think of what was to become Pokémon while completing Quinty, and before he officially founded Game Freak. Around this time, Nintendo announced the upcoming release of the Game Boy, a handheld console that would revolutionize the gaming industry. Tajiri learned that the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding Game Link Cable, two Game Boys could be linked together. Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident while playing Dragon Quest II (1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for the Famicom (NES). The game features randomly appearing items of varying rarity, including an extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat. Tajiri did not encounter any, while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to another. He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something else. Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri's idea would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood experiences, and an attempt to \"regain the world that he had lost\". He would later state that the game represents \"the story of a boy's summer day\".\n\nTajiri and his Game Freak staff began pondering over a game centered on capturing creatures of differing rarity. Since the Game Boy is a portable device, these creatures could then be exchanged with other players in real life using the link cable. Once the player has caught a creature in-game, it was to be stored in miniaturized form in a special capsule. This facet of the game was inspired by Ultraseven, a tokusatsu show that Tajiri had enjoyed as a child. The series' titular character owns a number of capsules containing miniaturized kaiju (monsters), which come out and return to their original sizes when the capsule is thrown into mid-air. Kaiju media in general were an important influence on Pokemon, as many Game Freak staff members had grown up with them. Other influences that have been cited by Tajiri include: gashapon, capsules with toy figures in them that can be drawn from vending machines; collectible cards, such as baseball cards, Ultraman cards and menko; The Final Fantasy Legend (1989), the first RPG for the Game Boy; and petting in Japan, with Tajiri noting that having Pokemon is similar to having pets. Tajiri initially named his project Capsule Monsters, which GF's staff commonly shortened to Capumon. However, it later turned out that the term Capsule Monsters could not be trademarked, and it was subsequently decided to call the game Pocket Monsters, which became Pokemon. According to Tomisawa (2000), the phrase \"Capsule Monsters\" was already registered. According to Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000), the word \"capsule\" could not be used in the trademark. Tomisawa (2000) states that the Game Freak staff then came up with several alternatives, before someone within the team suggested \"Pocket Monsters\".\nIn March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape's principal work was Mother (1989), a role-playing game written by Itoi, but it was also founded with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games. At the time, Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo. Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri, was involved with Ape's management (and would become its vice-president in 1991). Tajiri's relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present his idea for Pocket Monsters at Ape's office. Present during Tajiri's pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo's General Affairs Department and was also a manager at Ape. Kawaguchi brought the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who reportedly said: \"This is it. This is the idea I've been waiting for.\" By pure coincidence, Ishihara had come up with an idea for a game similar to that of Tajiri, and around the same time was discussing it with Ape. This game, Toto, involved \"using the Game Boy as an insect cage\". Ishihara emphasized, however, that the idea of trading creatures with the link cable was Tajiri's. GF and Ape agreed to merge their projects together. According to Tajiri, the two teams initially collaborated on the game, but the work proved difficult, one of the reasons being that Ape was busy developing EarthBound. Tajiri eventually figured that \"rather than working with Ape, we had to do something on our own, or the project would never get finished\". Ape, Inc. is not credited on the final product.\nThe development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned delivery of the game in October. Tajiri directed the project, working under Ishihara. Ishihara was the producer – he managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game's overall progress, and served as a liaison between Game Freak and Nintendo. Ishihara also contributed ideas to the development, and helped with debugging. Sugimori was in charge of the graphics and character design. Masuda created all music and sound effects, and did part of the programming. The budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low; thus, Pocket Monsters was initially planned as a small, compact game, based primarily around Tajiri's core idea of exchanging. However, as development progressed, GF's ideas and ambitions for Pokemon grew. They soon realized that the game they were beginning to envision would not be easy to make. Sugimori admitted that, at the time, no one at GF had much knowledge of RPGs. \"We thought we could handle it, but as we began working, we realized it was going to be tough\", he acknowledged. Pocket Monsters was suspended indefinitely, and GF turned their focus on other titles (see Game Freak § Games).\nAfter the game's initial development phase in 1990 and 1991, the staff \"tinkered with it from time to time\", as Sugimori put it. For instance, by October 1992, a large number of Pokemon had been designed, and a poll was held that month among all staff members to gauge the popularity of the different species. Several more such votes followed to determine collectively which Pokemon should be included. Still, development had mostly come to a halt until the summer of 1994, after the release of the platform game Pulseman, upon which Tajiri decided it was time to make a serious effort towards finishing Pocket Monsters. By this point, Game Freak's experience had grown considerably. Over the years, a number of new staff members had been added to the company. One of them was Atsuko Nishida, a graphic artist who created Pikachu, among others. Ishihara used his knowledge of card games to add more depth to the battle system, and among other things suggested Pokemon types. Ishihara also came up with the idea of the Pokedex, a portable encyclopedic device which players can use to keep track of the Pokemon they caught. Throughout the years, Tajiri had several conversations with Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo's top game designer who Tajiri described as a mentor figure. Although, in a 2018 retrospect, Miyamoto downplayed his role in advising Tajiri, and stated that his contributions to Pokemon were in fact limited. Miyamoto did, however, suggest the use of different colored cartridges for the game, in response to Tajiri's and Ishihara's musings about making each playthrough slightly different, as to 'individualize' the player's experience. According to Tajiri, \"five or seven colors\" were considered, but they eventually settled on two: Red and Green. Otherwise identical, each had Pokemon not found in the other, encouraging players to socialize and trade to complete their collection.\nIshihara aspired to create video games of his own. As Pocket Monsters Red and Green were nearing completion, Ishihara founded Creatures, Inc. on 8 November 1995. Upon founding, the company was housed in the same office building as Nintendo in Tokyo. Co-ownership of the Pokemon property, which Ishihara helped create, was subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in Pokemon having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne Allison (2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought the property after Red and Green were finished. Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) noted that the ownership structure of Pokemon is uncommon. They wrote that \"Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company\", like The Walt Disney Company does with their IPs. Tajiri and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. \"I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara\", he said. \"It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I\". Tajiri noted that, since Game Freak and Creatures both focus on Pokemon, it sometimes felt more like different departments than different companies.\nPocket Monsters Red and Green were finally finished in December 1995. A release date of 21 December that year was announced, but missed. After sufficient cartridges, manuals and packages had been manufactured, the pair of games ended up being published on 27 February 1996. However, the property was copyrighted in 1995, and \"© 1995\" is shown on the title screens and cartridges. This year is since used on the copyright notice seen on many Pokemon products, even though no actual Pokemon product was released in 1995.\n\n1996–1998: Rise in Japan\nRelease of Red and Green\nNintendo had no high expectations of Pocket Monsters Red and Green, and media largely ignored the game(s). By 1996, the seven-year-old Game Boy console was considered yesterday's news and near the end of its lifecycle. On the other hand, new Game Boys continued to be manufactured and sold. The console was widespread and, due to its age, affordable to children. Also, the Game Boy had experienced a small revival in Japan in 1995 due to the success of Mario's Picross. Coincidentally, this game was directed by Ishihara, and co-developed by Ape. The popularity of Mario's Picross incited Nintendo to develop the Game Boy Pocket, a slimmer and improved version of the Game Boy, released in Japan on 21 July 1996. Because of the timing and naming, some were under the impression that the Game Boy Pocket was made to promote Pocket Monsters, but this was in fact a coincidence that would end up benefiting both.\n\nCoroCoro manga, Mew lottery\nTwo media channels that would play important roles in the Pokemon franchise were the CoroCoro Comic, released monthly, and its sister magazine Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic, released bi-monthly. Both manga magazines are published by Shogakukan, a long-time business partner of Nintendo, and have featured manga based on Nintendo properties (e.g. Super Mario-kun, Kirby of the Stars, Donkey Kong). At the time of Pokemon's release, the main CoroCoro magazine was read by one in four elementary school students. CoroCoro's deputy editor-in-chief was Masakazu Kubo. On Ishihara's suggestion, Kubo commissioned the creation of a manga adaptation. Written and illustrated by Kosaku Anakubo, its first chapter was featured in the March/April issue of Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic, released on 28 February 1996, the day after Red and Green's release. Shogakukan, which frequently surveys their target groups, determined that the Pocket Monsters manga was well received.\nTo further promote Red and Green, the May issue of CoroCoro, released on 15 April 1996, announced the \"Legendary Pokemon Offer\", centered around a mysterious, secret Pokemon called Mew. Mew was a last-minute addition to Red & Green. It is unobtainable in the game(s) through usual means, and was intended to be used at a later point in some post-launch activity. To participate in the promotion, CoroCoro readers had to send in a postcard, and from the entrants, 20 were selected at random. The winners then had to send in their cartridge so that Mew could be uploaded onto it. The lottery was a success and increased word-of-mouth. By September, sales of Red and Green had surpassed 1 million units.\n\nBlue Version\nAfter the release of Pokemon Red and Green, Game Freak continued to grow, and a number of new employees were hired. For training purposes, they were ordered to study and make bug fixes to the source code of Red & Green, and to create new sprites for it; the test was later dubbed Pocket Monsters Blue. It was originally not meant to be sold. Only a small number of handmade copies were made, intended as a special gift to \"20 to 100 people\". After Kubo learned of it, he encouraged Tajiri and Ishihara to allow an official release of Blue. President Hiroshi Yamauchi initially rejected this, fearing it would confuse people into believing it was an entirely new Pokemon game. Kawaguchi then suggested an alternative, which Yamauchi agreed with: Blue would not receive a normal retail release, but would instead be made available only through mail order for a limited time as a special offer. It was announced in the November issue of CoroCoro, which explicitly stated that Blue was not a new game, but rather a special, limited edition to celebrate 1 million sales of Red and Green. The offer was a surprisingly big success: 300,000 units were expected to be sold, but over double was ordered.\n\nTrading Card Game\nThe Pokemon Trading Card Game was one of the first collectible card games (CCGs) developed in Japan. Its creation was influenced by Magic: The Gathering, the first CCG in history. Indeed, the Pokemon Trading Card Game can be considered a simplified version of Magic. First released in the United States in 1993, Magic had gained popularity not just in North America and Europe, but also in Asia. Ishihara was fond of playing cards, and had contributed to the development of at least three simple card games designed by Shigesato Itoi and released through Ape, Inc. At the time, Ishihara was particularly interested in Magic: The Gathering. While developing the Pokemon RPG, he realized that the concept behind it could be adapted into a Magic-like CCG. The Pokemon Trading Card Game was designed by Ishihara, Akihiko Miura, Kōichi Ōyama, and Takumi Akabane. All were former staff members of Ape and had previously worked on EarthBound (1994): Miura was the game's main designer, Ōyama was its art director, and Akabane was one of its chief debuggers.\nWhile card games have a long history in Japan, a collectible card game was a relatively new concept there, and at the time not widely known. Because of this, Ishihara had difficulties finding distributors. Sometime in 1995, Ishihara pitched the card game to Nintendo. They agreed to have the cards manufactured, subcontracting an unidentified printing company. However, Nintendo did not want the hassle of having to develop a distribution system from the ground up, i.e. finding retailers willing to sell a CCG. Ishihara was then contacted by Satoshi Kayama, director of a small firm called Media Factory. Like Ishihara, Kayama was a fan of card games. He felt that CCGs would soon rise to prominence in Japan, and had been gathering information on the possibility of developing such a game in some form. When Kayama heard that Creatures had developed a CCG, he contacted Ishihara and offered to distribute it, signing the contract near the end of 1995.\nCoroCoro again proved a valuable information channel. The Trading Card Game was first announced in the November issue, the same one that announced Pokemon Blue. The issue came bundled with two promo cards: one of Purin (Jigglypuff) and one of Pikachu. Surveys showed that they were respectively the most and second-most popular Pokemon at the time. On 20 October 1996, the first card set was released. Booster packs were launched the same day, containing 10 randomly inserted cards. In the West, the booster packs contained 11 cards. The original set would be titled the Base Set in English. Many more sets would follow. Despite being ignored by the media, except for the CoroCoro, the cards became an instant success upon release. 87 million Pokemon cards were shipped by the end of March 1997, six months after its launch, and one month before the debut of the next big installment of the franchise: the Pokemon anime. The success of the TV series would cause the cards' sales figure to explode: by March 1998, a total of 499 million cards had been produced in Japan.\n\nAnime production launches\nBy August 1996, Kubo had become convinced of Pokemon's potential, and believed Shogakukan should create an anime adaptation. Nintendo was hesitant, noting that if the anime would flop, it would negatively affect the popularity of the game. Ishihara initially opposed the idea, because he thought it would overly hasten the 'consumption' of the property: he feared that if the series would end, people would assume that Pokemon has ended, and move on to the next thing. At the time, Creatures and Game Freak were planning the sequel(s) to Red and Green, Pokemon Gold and Silver, and Ishihara did not want the anime to end before they could release their new games. Kubo was ultimately able to resolve the concerns of all parties involved. An important aspect of Kubo's bargaining power was the then-ongoing Mini 4WD craze and its accompanying hit series Bakusō Kyōdai Let's & Go!!. Kubo had an important role in the creation of both, which impressed the stakeholders. To appease Ishihara, Kubo promised him that the anime would last for at least a year and a half. This was unusually long for a debuting anime, and required a big investment. Kubo's proposal for Pocket Monsters was officially approved on 26 September 1996. For Nintendo of Japan, it was the first time they licensed a TV series. Kubo assigned independent producer Choji Yoshikawa to lead the project.\nShogakukan Productions, commonly called ShoPro, was Shogakukan's production company. The animation company they commissioned was OLM, Inc. (Oriental Light and Magic), on Kubo's suggestion. Kunihiko Yuyama, one of OLM's founding members, became the anime's director. ShoPro assembled a team of five writers, plus two supporting writers. All key people involved with the production of Pokemon were well-experienced and had proven track records within Japan's anime industry. Yoshikawa felt that the team got lucky. \"The probability of so many great people coming together at the same time is very low\", he said. Per Tajiri's explicit condition, every anime team member had to play the game extensively, including the illustrators and voice actors. The anime staff \"unanimously agreed that the game was interesting\" and \"felt connected with each other through the world of Pokemon\", feeling positively challenged to make an anime that would match the game's quality.\n\nA production council was formed to produce the anime. Different people appeared at different meetings, but four individuals usually present were Ishihara of Creatures, Sugimori of Game Freak, Yuyama of OLM, and independent producer Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa had the final say. The council decided on the anime's worldview, characters, general storyline, and various important details. The early meetings, which were also attended by Tajiri, usually started with a Q&A session in which Tajiri and Ishihara were asked about the Pokemon universe. The council was careful to have the anime be in concordance with the video game. Inevitably, there had to be differences between the two, but all agreed that the overall worldview as envisioned by Tajiri should not be disturbed. At the start of the video game, the player has to choose one of three starter Pokemon: Fushigidane, Hitokage, or Zenigame (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle). The council didn't want to unfairly popularize any of them, and wanted the protagonist to start out with a different Pokemon. Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) wrote that, by coincidence, three people independently suggested to the council that a Pikachu should be a main character in the anime: Kubo, Yuyama, and Keisuke Iwata of TV Tokyo's Film Department. In the end, all council members agreed that Pikachu should be one of Pocket Monsters' central icons, as they expected Pikachu to appeal to both boys and girls, as well as their mothers. This would expand its audience, which was considered a core objective of the anime.\nDuring the council's first meeting, Yoshikawa brought up the issue on whether the Pokemon in the anime could talk, and if not, how they could communicate. In the video games, each has a specific cry. In Anakubo's CoroCoro manga, most could speak. At first, the council believed there should be a mixture of Pokemon that could talk and some that could not. However, this idea was eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a specific cry. The council agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and while they and humans should be able to understand each other in the series, they should not speak each other's language. It was decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in various intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue Otani. During try-outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as in 'Pikachu talk', in which it only said the syllables of its name. Yuyama realized that, even in the latter style of limited communication, Otani was experienced enough to still convey the messages and emotions needed.\nShoPro paid half of the production cost of Pokemon. TV Tokyo paid the other half and was granted co-ownership of the anime. The ads during the show's commercial breaks were managed by advertisement agency JR Kikaku, which was in turn paid by sponsors buying advertisement space. In negotiating with TV Tokyo, Kubo managed to secure the 19:00 – 19:30 timeslot on Tuesdays. Pocket Monsters premiered on 1 April 1997. By November, it had become the highest-rated program on TV Tokyo. The anime succeeded in its goal of widening Pokemon's audience. Although the video games and the cards remained mostly of interest to boys, the anime also got more girls interested in the franchise, and girls' purchases of Pokemon products increased. This has been partly credited to Pikachu, who gained widespread popularity among both boys and girls. The success of this character would later lead to the game Pocket Monsters Pikachu (Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition), released in Japan on 12 September 1998. An adaptation of Pokemon Blue, this version was made to resemble the TV series more.\n\nCopyright council formed, merchandising expands\nIn the early months of the franchise, Nintendo was the contractual representative for Pokemon, and thus the central contact point for all Pokemon-related licensing (the approval of branded products). Around the time that planning of the anime begun, licensing requests for Pokemon started to increase, which Nintendo had difficulties handling due to a lack of (experienced) staff. Nintendo consequently granted ShoPro exclusive licensor rights. This was the first time that Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) granted licensor rights to another company, aside from its overseas subsidiaries Nintendo of America (NoA) and Nintendo of Europe (NoE).\nA copyright council was formed, headed by Ishihara. Beginning in April 1997, the council met every Tuesday, in the conference room of Creatures' office, at the Nintendo Kanda Building in Sudachō, Tokyo. Attendees usually included Ishihara and his secretary, representatives of Nintendo, Game Freak, ShoPro, TV Tokyo, and JR Kikaku, as well as head of the anime Yoshikawa. Broadly put, every meeting had three types of agenda items: discussing Pokemon-related events and basic policies in Japan, discussing Shogakukan publication plans, and considering merchandise proposals. For merchandising, the council set the bar high. Fiercely protective of Pokemon's brand equity, Ishihara was unwilling to greenlit an item just because it had a picture of a Pokemon printed on it. To avoid the market being flooded with low-quality goods, Ishihara put very specific demands on the products he evaluated. Furthermore, in most cases, the council opted to contract one company for each product category. Because of this, most merchandise proposals were rejected: of the approximately 7,500 applications submitted in 1997, only about 5% was approved.\nBy March 1998, 35 companies offered licensed Pokemon goods, and there were approximately 700 Pokemon products. Tomy manufactured Pokemon toy figures and plush dolls. Bandai made Pokemon gashapon, dolls and ramune-flavored candy in a plastic box in the shape of a Game Boy. Meiji Seika produced Pokemon chocolate snacks and pudding. The lucrative franchise provided a much-needed boost to Japan's economy, which was stagnating in what would later be called the Lost Decade. An example of a firm that benefited greatly from Pokemon was food manufacturer Nagatanien. From May 1997, the company began selling Pokemon-branded curry, furikake, and baking mixes. In December 1997, Nagatanien was hit hard by the collapse of one of its biggest sales channels, Toshoku, in what was then the third-largest bankruptcy in Japan's postwar history. Nonetheless, due to their Pokemon-licensed products, Nagatanien reported net profits in fiscal years '97 and '98, despite having forecasted losses.\n\n\"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" incident\nIn the evening of 16 December 1997, the Pokemon franchise was hit by a crisis related to the broadcast of the anime's 38th episode, \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" (Computer Warrior Porygon). It was watched by approximately 4.6 million households. In the episode, the cast is transported into a virtual world, accompanied by a Porygon, a digital, human-made Pokemon. While flying through cyberspace, they are attacked by an anti-virus program which mistakes them for viruses, shooting \"vaccine missiles\" at the group resulting in explosions of bright, rapidly swapping red and blue flashes.\nThe intense stimuli brought about by the episode triggered a variety of adverse health effects in more than 10,000 viewers, primarily irritated eyes, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. A small part suffered a photosensitive epileptic seizure, manifested in loss of conscious and/or convulsions. Hundreds of children were brought to hospitals, although a part of them had recovered enough upon arrival and did not need to be hospitalized. No one died. Broadcasting of Pokemon was halted, and new guidelines were implemented to help prevent similar events from happening. With the show on hiatus, ShoPro and OLM worked on a feature Pokemon film. By the time the incident occurred, its script was already written, and the movie was in the storyboard stage. In mid-January, the staff resumed creating new episodes. The anime series returned on 16 April 1998. The film, titled Pocket Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (Pokémon: The First Movie), premiered on 18 July 1998, and became the fourth highest grossing film of the year in Japan.\nUltimately, the incident did not damage the Pokemon franchise – it in fact grew further during and after the anime's hiatus. While video rental tapes were removed from shelves, all other Pokemon products continued to be sold as usual, and customer demand for them remained high. Helping matters was a general understanding among businesses that the anime was not canceled, but rather suspended, and many executives (correctly) expected the show to be resumed after precautions had been taken. Supermarkets and other distribution outlets responded calmly to the crisis, and did not remove Pokemon products from their sales floors.\n\n1998–2000: International expansion\nNorth America\nPossibly the first official to show interest in a North American launch of Pokemon was Minoru Arakawa, founder and then-president of Nintendo of America (NoA). Arakawa visited Japan to participate in Shoshinkai 1996, held 22–24 November. It was around this time when he first played one of the three Pokemon titles. He thought the games were promising, but Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) had no plans at the time to release them elsewhere. He returned to America with a few cartridges and tested the game on his employees – they did not believe it would work in the US. At the time, role-playing games (RPGs) were not very popular outside Japan, and NoA executives believed that American children did not have the attention span for such a complex title. Americans were said to be more interested in sport- and action-oriented games, preferably with realistic graphics. Japanese people, by contrast, were alleged to care more about characters and plot. Up to that point, few Japanese properties had been successfully mainstreamed in the US, and if they were, it was alleged to be on account of having been properly Americanized: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was considered a prime example of this. Visually, Pokemon was believed to be too kawaii, or cute. It was assumed that Pokemon could not succeed on cute alone – it must also be cool. In an effort to enhance the franchise's coolness, NoA considered a graphical redesign and contracted a few external artists to create some test-designs for the American market. The mockups they proposed included 'graffiti style' drawings, 'beefed-up' and more muscular looking Pokemon, and a new Pikachu that looked like \"a tiger with huge breasts\". Arakawa concluded that it \"didn't work\", and by that time, the anime had begun its production in Japan, leading NoA to conclude it was too late for a graphical revamp anyway.\nOf pivotal importance to Pokemon's global expansion was Alfred R. Kahn, CEO of US-based 4Kids Entertainment, NoA's licensing agent since 1987. Convinced of the franchise's potential, Kahn agreed to invest an undisclosed sum in return for both the anime and licensing rights. Pokemon became one of the first Japanese media franchises in which both the localization of the anime and the licensing of merchandise was handled by a single company, as well as a non-Japanese company. Kahn suggested to use the short version of the name, \"Pokémon\", adding an acute accent (´) over the e to assist with pronunciation and \"give it a little flair\". NoJ president Hiroshi Yamauchi officially approved the project in late November, and subsequently announced it at Space World 1997. However, three weeks later, the \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" incident happened, which Kubo felt made even more people resistant to the idea of an overseas introduction.\nMarket research turned back negative: American kids reportedly did not like Pokémon. Arakawa ignored the study and, convinced of the franchise's potential, allocated an enormous budget to Pokémon's launch. The exact amount was not disclosed, but was reportedly equal to or more than $50 million (c. $96.46 million in 2024), approximately the same amount as the launch budget of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. Arakawa admitted that it was \"quite a bit of money\", but NoA \"had been doing well for several years, so we had a lot of money to spare\". He opined that if Pokémon would be as successful in the US as it had been in Japan, \"an investment of 1 would turn into 100\". NoA and 4Kids proceeded to devise a strategy on how to localize Pokémon for the United States. Arakawa appointed Gail Tilden to lead the project, prompting her to leave her position at Nintendo Power magazine. Tilden said that they \"decided to make an all-out effort to repeat the phenomenon in the Western world\". In two press releases, NoA self-described Pokémon's marketing campaign as \"aggressive\".\nThe localization of the Pokémon anime was done by 4Kids, and directed by Norman J. Grossfeld. Grossfeld strongly believed that the anime should be Americanized. At NATPE 1998, he asked ShoPro for a \"kind of carte blanche, to let me change the show as I think would work for this market\", to which ShoPro agreed. However, no national TV station  was interested in buying the anime or financing its localization. Kahn then decided to self-finance Pokémon's production costs, despite realizing this \"could very well bring down 4Kids\" if the show would fail. According to Kahn, they \"spend a fortune\" on the localization. To have it broadcast in syndication, 4Kids offered the show for free to local TV stations across the country, in exchange for a portion of the advertising revenue. NoA assisted, persuading dozens of stations to carry the series by offering to buy some of their advertisement space, spending a total of $5 million (c. $9.65 million in 2024). Despite all this, most broadcasters were still reluctant to carry Pokémon, with Grossfeld experiencing difficulties getting through their \"preconceived notions or their snobbery for Western-produced animation over something from Asia\". At the time, anime had not yet found mainstream popularity in the West. Contemporary news reports cited Sailor Moon as an example of an anime that had failed to catch on with American youth. Still, with NoA's help, 4Kids ultimately succeeded in contracting 112 broadcasters for Pokémon, reaching \"about 85 to 90 percent\" of television households. However, many broadcasters gave it off-peak time slots, with starting times like 06:00 or 06:30. Prior to the late 1990s, this was the case for many anime in the US.\nGrossfeld came up with the advertising slogan \"Gotta catch 'em all!\" as the English equivalent to the Japanese Pokemon GETTO daze~! (ポケモンゲットだぜー！, Get (the) Pokémon!). The phrase \"miraculously managed to gain approval\" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which normally prohibits the use of injunctions in ads directed at children (e.g. \"You must buy this!\"). While the tagline does sound commanding, the FCC reasoned that the act of catching is at the core of Pokémon's play. Therefore, the phrase was allowed. The series' theme song was written by John Loeffler and John Siegler, and performed by Jason Paige. In commissioning the track, Grossfeld specifically requested the song's chorus to be written around the \"Gotta catch 'em all\" phrase, firmly embedding the slogan into the theme.\nWhile NoA and 4Kids were allowed a fair degree of liberty in their localization of Pokémon, the Japanese copyright council, headed by Ishihara, had the last say over it. All decisions regarding adjustments and promotion had to gain final approval of the Japan side. This included all of the merchandise, for which a 'two-step system' was created. All (aspiring) licensees in North America were to send their merchandise proposals to 4Kids. Staff of both 4Kids and NoA then made a pre-selection and send the approved proposals to Japan, where the council made the final decision. Many submissions were bounced at the US stage, and thus never got sent to Japan. Tilden noted that processing all license applications, and mailing all approved prototypes and their documentation to Japan, was a lot of work. Arakawa did consider streamlining the process by moving someone from Japan to the US, but no person could be found who was as competent as Ishihara.\nThe Pokémon anime was first broadcast on 7 September 1998. Pokémon Red Version and Blue Version were released three weeks later, on 28 September 1998. To localize the card game, Nintendo contracted Wizards of the Coast, the creator of Magic: The Gathering. The Pokémon Trading Card Game was officially launched nationwide on 9 January 1999, although pre-sold in select stores in December. Coinciding with the North American launch of Pokémon was the release of the Game Boy Color on 23 November 1998.\n\nOther regions\nThe American version of the Pokémon anime started broadcasting in Australia and New Zealand on 28 September 1998. Red and Blue were subsequently released there on 23 October. Various territories in Asia followed: the anime series debuted in Hong Kong on 16 November, in Taiwan on 23 November, in Shanghai on 24 November, in Beijing on 10 January 1999, and in South Korea on 14 July 1999.\nOutside North America, 4Kids distributed the anime in cooperation with Brian Lacey of Lacey Entertainment. The series was presented at MIP TV, in Cannes, France, from 3–8 April 1998. Broadcasters were initially not interested due to its Japanese origins, and preferred to wait and see how the anime would fare in the US. After its American success, Lacey received inquiries about the series throughout 1999 from multiple international broadcasters. Lacey noted that, in Europe, this was a stark contrast compared to previous years: \"I was trying to sell this sort of stuff for years and buyers would tell me they were moving away from Japanese animation shows\", he said. In October 1999, the franchise was launched in the European key markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. The anime started broadcasting in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in December 1999. In 2000, broadcasting rights for the first season were secured by TV stations in South Africa, Russia, Iceland, and Finland. In Israel, the anime debuted in February 2000. For unclear reasons, Red and Blue were not officially released there. Thriving only on the strength of the TV series, The First Movie, the cards, and imported video games, the Israeli Pokémon still became a success.\nBy the end of 2000, Pokémon games had been released in 70 countries, the anime was broadcast in 51 countries, the films were released in 33 countries, and the cards had been translated into 11 languages.\n\n1999–2000: Pokémania\nIn North America, the debuting Pokémon franchise quickly rose to success. Red and Blue sold 200,000 copies in its first month. By December 1998, the Pokémon anime had become the highest-rated syndicated children's show during the weekdays. This attracted the attention of two media companies: Warner Bros., co-owner of The WB channel; and Saban Entertainment/Fox Family Worldwide, owners of the Fox Kids channel. A bidding war ensued between the parties, which was won by Warner Bros. On 13 February 1999, Pokémon launched on the Kids' WB national television block. The debut episode became the most watched premiere in Kids' WB's history. In European countries, the anime received similar levels of success. For example, in Germany, \"a highly competitive kids market\", Pokémon was purchased by RTL 2. The show's popularity bolstered the entire program block, more than tripling its viewers. Andrea Lang, RTL 2's editor of cartoons and children's programs, said: \"We were speechless. We've never had a comparable success\". By March 1998, half a year before Pokémon's overseas launch, 499 million Pokémon cards had been produced. By March 1999, the total number of cards shipped reached 764 million. By March 2000, this figure would grow further to 4.255 billion cards, manufactured in both Japanese and American factories.\nBy April 1999, there was a general consensus in the US that Pokémon had become a phenomenon and the newest children's fad. By some, the fad was referred to as \"Pokémania\", including journalists of Time and USA Today. In the US, severe scarcity occurred of Pokémon goods, especially Pokémon cards, causing companies to miss profits. A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, published on 3 August 1999, cited a Toys \"R\" Us manager as saying that a supply of 600 booster packs would last 24 hours. The CEO of one card distributor stated that they were \"thousands of boxes behind\" on orders. In the same article, a Wizards spokeswoman stated that more employees and printers had been hired to increase card production. However, near the end of the month, a different Wizards spokeswoman told The Washington Post that they had \"exhausted most of the card-printing capacity of the United States\". Similarly, USA Today reported in November 1999 that factories making Hasbro's Pokémon toys had expanded production by 20 times, but demand still exceeded supply. In Europe, scarcity of Pokémon merchandise also occurred.\nIn part due to the Pokémon craze, Nintendo saw a 250% increase in profits in 1999 compared to the previous year, reaching a six-year high. The Pokémon franchise accounted for over 30% of Nintendo's revenue that year. Pokémon's popularity also caused a sharp increase in sales of the Game Boy line. The financial windfalls came at a time when Nintendo lost dominance in the home console market, with the Nintendo 64 being outsold by Sony's PlayStation. The global success of Pokémon compensated this loss somewhat. Buckingham & Sefton-Green went even further, writing in 2004: \"while Nintendo is now among Japan's most profitable corporations, it could be argued that the company would have struggled to survive without Pokémon\".\n4Kids, initially a little-known firm, expanded thirty times in revenues, and was named the fastest-growing company in America in the 4 September 2000, issue of Fortune magazine. Many businesses that timely obtained a Pokémon license reaped considerable profits. In the summer of 1999, a massive run on stocks of publicly traded Pokémon licensees caused their value to increase dramatically. However, by November, most investors were shorting their shares. Realizing that Pokémon was a fad that would peak and fall at some point, investors were bearish about its prospects.\nPokémon: The First Movie premiered in North America on 12 November 1999, and in Europe the following year. Despite being negatively received by many Western critics, it became one of the most successful Japanese animated films of all time. In the United States, November 1999 was estimated to have been the peak of Pokémania. Supporting the American release of The First Movie was a promotional action with Burger King, one of the largest in the history of the fast-food industry. The success of the promotion resulted in supply issues; restaurants often ran out of Pokémon toys to include with their meals. On 27 December, Burger King recalled its Poké Ball toy after a 13-month-old girl died suffocating on one.\nPokémon Gold and Silver, the successors to Red/Green/Blue, were released in North America on 15 October 2000. In Europe, they were released on 6 April 2001.\n\nThe Pokémon Company and Pokémon USA established\nOn 23 April 1998, Pokémon Center Co. Ltd. was founded as a joint venture by Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak. It was initially formed for the management of specialized merchandise stores called Pokemon Centers, of which the first location opened in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on 18 July 1998. Throughout the years, multiple Japanese Pokémon Centers would open and close. As of January 2024, a total of 24 Pokémon merchandise shops exist in Japan. An American Pokémon Center also existed in New York City from 2001 to 2005. It was then remodelled into Nintendo World, later renamed Nintendo New York.\nAfter the release of Gold and Silver, Tsunekazu Ishihara began setting out a number of long-term goals for the Pokémon franchise, which included releasing a movie every year. As part of Ishihara's plan, the Pokemon Center Co. Ltd. was reformatted into the Pokémon Company (TPC), and officially renamed in October 2000. The goal of TPC is to centralize and streamline the global management of Pokémon. Satoru Iwata, who had joined Nintendo of Japan in June, was involved with the company's creation, which was one of his first jobs at Nintendo.\nIn February 2001, Pokémon USA (PUSA) was established, an affiliated firm of the Pokémon Company. The company's first president was Tatsumi Kimishima (who would later become president of NoA, and subsequently president of NoJ). In 2002, Kimishima was succeeded by Akira Chiba.\n\n2001–2006: End of the craze, business reforms\nIn North America, Pokémania peaked in 1999, slowing down throughout the next year. On 29 April 2000, the anime was bumped off Kids' WB's No. 1 spot after holding it for 54 weeks. Around the same time, Pokémon was surpassed at Fox Kids by its rival Digimon. In Europe, the craze peaked in 2000. On 20 January 2001, The New York Times reported that Pokémon's trading card market had collapsed in the US. A June 2001 survey in the United Kingdom confirmed that Pokémon's popularity was waning there. Tobin (2004) wrote: \"By the summer of 2001, Pokémon's shelf space in Japanese and U.S. toy stores was but a fraction of what it enjoyed in the fall of 1999\". By the end of 2001, Pokémania was fading globally, and by 2002, the fad was largely over.\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Game Freak developed Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the successors to Gold and Silver, for the newly released Game Boy Advance. Masuda, who was appointed to assistant director during Gold and Silver, was promoted to director for Ruby and Sapphire, with Tajiri making himself executive director. Masuda was concerned that the end of Pokémania indicated the end of Pokémon as a whole: \"After Gold and Silver came out, it was a huge hit around the world, but shortly after everyone was saying, 'That's it. The Pokémon fad is over! It's dead!'.\" Determined to keep the franchise going, GF not only wanted to \"prove people wrong\" with Ruby and Sapphire, but already started planning their sequels: Diamond and Pearl (2006). They also began planning remakes of older installments, starting with FireRed and LeafGreen (2004), remakes of the original Red and Green.\nRuby and Sapphire were released in Japan on 21 November 2002, and in the rest of the world the next year. The games introduced 135 new Pokémon, bringing the total amount to 386. Because of this, Golin Harris, NoA's ad agency, advised them to move away from the \"Gotta catch 'em all!\" slogan. They reasoned that if new, younger players were drawn into the franchise with Ruby/Sapphire, they would find the concept of \"catching them all\" to be a daunting if not impossible task if they didn't also have Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal. Dockery (2022) noted that \"from both a marketing perspective and, really, a legal perspective, it would not be to the company's advantage to keep pushing that slogan\".\nBy 2002, the relationship between Pokémon USA (PUSA) and Wizards of the Coast had deteriorated. That year, at least seven high-profile employees were poached from Wizards by PUSA: Wizard's former art director, senior graphic designer, business manager, events marketing director, project management director, and two vice presidents. All employees had signed NDAs. In March 2003, PUSA told Wizards that their contract would not be renewed, and that Wizards would not be distributing the new Ruby & Sapphire card set. Later, Wizards was also prohibited from releasing the sets Jamboree and Legendary Collection II. Notably, Jamboree was the first set containing cards designed by Wizards themselves. As considerable time and money was invested into creating them, Wizards was upset when they were barred from putting them out. On 1 October 2003, the day after their agreement expired, Wizards filed suit against Pokémon USA, alleging that the defendant had seized their intellectual property and trade secrets, and illegally tried to gain advantage over them in the competitive trading card market. The case was settled out of court. Jamboree and Legendary Collection II have remained unreleased.\nIn October 2001, 4Kids Entertainment signed a new contract with PUSA, continuing to serve as Pokémon's exclusive licensing agent and anime localizer. On 23 December 2005, it was announced that the agreement would not be renewed and would expire on 31 December, with PUSA moving all licensing in-house. The localization of the anime would be done by PUSA in cooperation with TAJ Productions. PUSA proceeded to replace almost all of the original English voice actors, who were still under contract with 4Kids. This decision \"raised the ire of fans and the actors themselves\". According to Stuart Zagnit, who voiced Professor Oak, the recasting was done to cut back on costs.\nIn March 2003, Pokémon UK was established in London as a British representative of the Pokémon Company.\n\n2006–2012: Generation IV–V, TPCi established\nFollowing Ruby and Sapphire, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were released for the Nintendo DS on 28 September 2006, in Japan and on 22 April 2007, in North America. A third version, Pokémon Platinum, was released on 28 September 2008, in Japan and on 22 March 2009, in North America. They form the fourth generation (Generation IV) in the Pokémon video game series. Diamond and Pearl were designed based on the DS's various features such as its Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridge. Pokémon president Tsunekazu Ishihara dubbed the games as the \"ultimate\" Pokémon titles because they allowed the player to trade and battle Pokémon including every Pokémon from previous iterations globally through WiFi, as opposed to previously only able to do so locally and with fewer Pokémon. The games' characters are 2D and the environments are rendered in 3D, and it is considerably difficult to differentiate them because Game Freak designed them this way to innovate the graphics while also retaining the traditional game style and feel.\nIn Platinum, the developers focused on changing the most essential elements from Diamond and Pearl to maintain continuity with the previous games. Director Junichi Masuda stated that since they designed Diamond and Pearl as the \"ultimate\" Pokémon titles, it was only necessary to make Platinum \"even stronger\" than them. They approached this by designing the \"Origin Forme\" for the legendary Pokémon Giratina, ensuring that the design would appear significantly different from its regular form in Diamond and Pearl and to express the games' core antimatter and Distortion World concepts. The title Platinum was chosen to reflect a precious material that \"shines\" and is different from diamond and pearl and their associations of \"love\" and \"happiness\" respectively.\nPokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver were released on 12 September 2009, in Japan and on 14 March 2010, in North America as part of Generation IV. They are remakes of Gold and Silver, aiming to balance familiarity for the original games' players and new content for newcomers. The titles reflected the theme of the bond between trainers and their Pokémon. The developers faithfully recreated the original story and added elements from the Generation IV games and Yellow, the latter of which was released concurrently with Gold and Silver.\nIn 2009, Pokémon USA and Pokémon UK merged to form the Pokémon Company International (TPCi). This subsidiary of the Pokémon Company (TPC) has since managed the Pokémon franchise outside of Asia.\nIn Generation V, Pokémon Black and White were released on 18 September 2010, in Japan for the DS and on 6 March 2011, in North America. The games feature enhanced visual effects and increased use of 3D graphics. The developers excluded old Pokémon and strategies, while introducing over 150 new Pokémon to evoke a sense of novelty and to provide new players a more \"leveled playing field\" against old players. The games seek to attract both new players and returning players through its detailed walkthrough and the addition of C-Gear (a real-time communication tool to improve the trade and battle experiences), respectively.\nThe games were followed by Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which were released on 23 June 2012, in Japan and on 7 October 2012, in North America. The games were developed for the DS rather than the more powerful Nintendo 3DS to maintain continuity with the game world in Black and White and they were presented from a different perspective in the storyline. Since the games are their first sequels, director Masuda explained that they have strived to find a \"fine balance\" to appeal to both newcomers and returning players by implementing introductory explanations, and by placing a Pokémon Center in the first in-game city, they were able to further this approach by providing newcomers with a detailed walkthrough and also returning players with new updates. During development phase, director Takao Unno revealed that they had experimented with a 100-player multiplayer experience via their communication feature Entralink drawing from their vision of players \"sharing the same space, same time and same game\" but this feature was never implemented due to technical limitations.\n\n2013–2018: 3D, Generation VI–VII, Pokémon Go\nIn Generation VI, Pokémon X and Y were released worldwide for the 3DS on 12 October 2013, and they are the first games to be released in this way. The developers focused on the themes of \"beauty\", \"bond\", and \"evolution\", and it is based on these themes that they created the games' core mechanic where Pokémon could achieve a higher form of evolution by strengthening their bonds with trainers; however, to maintain game balance, they limited this feature to a special, temporary phenomenon. The games' shift to fully 3D graphics allowed the player to freely manipulate the camera angles although due to technical limitations objects far away are rendered in lower polygon models, and producer Hitoshi Yamagami addressed to 2D players that \"Game Freak [developers are also] big fans of 2D graphics... So there are some elements in there that I [Yamagami] think fans of 2D will appreciate as well.\" When asked about the Horde battle and Sky battle types, he stated that Horde battles are to supplant the roles of \"really strong pokemon  [sic]\" to help the player more easily progress through the games and also to add \"more excitement to the battles and a sense of danger,\" and that they added the Sky battles to take advantage of the games' 3D camera angels capabilities.\nPokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were released worldwide for the 3DS on 21 November 2014 and on 28 November 2014, in Europe as part of Generation VI. They are remakes of Ruby and Sapphire. The developers adopted X and Y's core game mechanic and added enhanced 3D graphics. According to director Masuda, they reviewed the original mechanic and concept and expressed them using modern hardware, such as replacing the original PokéGear feature for the enhanced versions BuzzNav and DexNav to more effectively provide information enabled by the games' hardware capabilities. They seek to explore the concept of Pokémon coexisting with humans and nature, revisiting the concept behind original games' setting, which translated to \"richness or abundance in nature and bonds between people and nature\" in Japanese. To appeal to the newer audience in X and Y, the developers decided to connect the story with X and Y by further exploring their core mechanic.\nIn Generation VII, Pokémon Sun and Moon were released worldwide for the 3DS on 18 November 2016, and on 23 November 2016, in Europe. The developers chose Hawaii for inspiration due to its distinctive warm sunlight and clear moonlight and unique biomes that helped support the games' regional Pokémon variance concept. Ohmori said, as director, he aimed to focus on the concept of \"Pokémon as these living creatures, [and really focus] on them being alive.\" Having the release date on the 20th anniversary of Pokémon in mind, he treated this project as a \"celebration of that life, and to really express this respect for life.\" As he contemplated about life and its origins, Ohmori considered the significance of the Sun, enabling life with its light, and the Moon's impact on certain species' reproduction. He explained how the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth \"work [together] to influence [one another], and life as a result grows and flourishes based on [this] relationship.\"\nOhmori stated that with the innovation to 3D in X and Y the designers decided to examine more minor aspects concerning with the Pokémon themselves such as their motions, such as when they designed the games' first starter Pokémon to capitalize on its owl-like characteristics with its head \"twists round and round.\" With the 3DS technologies, the developers are able to design the characters to be more expressive as themselves including different facial expressions and reactions. In addition to portraying Pokémon harmoniously coexisting with people and vice versa in the games, the developers replaced the traditional Gym mechanic with Island Trials, deepening the players' connection with the story and their Pokémon. The enhanced versions Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were released worldwide on 17 November 2017. The games added an alternate storyline and additional characters, Pokémon, and other features. Developer Shigeki Morimoto revealed that they were developed by the younger staff members and veterans so the more veterans can prioritized on developing more important titles, and the developers considered them to be their culmination with the 3DS.\n\nPokémon Go\nIn 2016, the Pokémon franchise spawned a second worldwide fad with the release of Pokémon Go, a mobile augmented reality game. The app originated as a Google April Fools' Day joke in 2014: the \"Google Maps Pokémon Challenge\". The prank was conceived by Tsunekazu Ishihara and Satoru Iwata. On Ishihara's initiation, the hoax was turned into an actual video game developed by Niantic. Ishihara was a fan of Niantic's previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game's concept as a perfect match for Pokémon.\nThrough in-game purchases, the game generated more than $160 million by the end of July 2016, with App Annie reporting that Pokémon Go had generated around $10 million in revenue every day that month. The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more than $200 million in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record set by Clash of Clans and Candy Crush by a wide margin. The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. By 2 September 2016, Pokémon Go had generated more than $440 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower. By 30 September, it had received 500 million downloads and grossed $470 million in 80 days, according to market research firm Newzoo. Pokémon Go reached the milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.\nPokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! were released for the Nintendo Switch on 16 November 2018. They are part of Generation VII. Inspired by Pokémon Yellow, the games seek to introduce newcomers and a new generation of players (particularly Pokémon Go players) to the Pokémon series in addition to catering old players. As such, the games feature similar capture mechanics to Go where the player throws Poké Balls to catch wild Pokémon rather than battling them like traditional Pokémon games. In addition, the games feature the same setting and characters as the first generation of games and the original animated series, and include exclusively the original 151 Pokémon to further appeal to their targeted audience. The only new Pokémon featured are Meltan and Melmetal.\n\n2019–present: Generation VIII–IX, open-world gameplay\nGeneration VIII debuted with the release of Pokémon Sword and Shield on 15 November 2019, for the Switch. Director Shigeru Ohmori stated that they designed the games based on what they believed of the biggest Pokémon theme of becoming/being \"the greatest or strongest\", which was expressed in the games' Dynamax / Gigantamax Pokémon core mechanic and the games' increasingly powerful software and hardware capabilities. Ohmori further revealed that through developing the Let's Go games as research projects for the Switch, they were able to gain valuable experiences and knowledge to develop Sword and Shield. He noted that they took advantage of the Switch's high resolution and TV connectivity to implement the games' gigantic-size core Pokémon mechanic. They envisioned the games' setting to be a \"wide-open space\" that is different from the traditional route systems and is constantly changing where the player can meet and explore with other players.\nMany pre-existing Pokémon are not available in Sword and Shield. This \"Dexit\", as it was called, led to fan backlash. Sword and Shield were the first Pokémon games to receive DLC expansions: Part 1—The Isle of Armor, and Part 2—The Crown Tundra; they were released on 17 June 2020, and 22 October 2020, respectively. They include additional storylines, places, Pokémon, characters, and other features.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. The resulting widespread ennui and excessive leisure time inspired a resurgence in popularity and interest of Pokémon cards, which was further popularized by various YouTubers and other influencers, such as Logan Paul. The craze resulted in severe supply shortages, and customers' inappropriate and obsessive behavior raised safety concerns in many retail outlets. Pokémon cards' values skyrocketed, prompting collectors to submit cards and overwhelm card grading agencies. The Pokémon Company responded by reprinting impacted products at maximum capacity to ensure price stabilization and general accessibility.\nRemakes of Diamond and Pearl, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were released on 19 November 2021, for the Switch as part of Generation VIII. They are the first core series games to be developed by a third-party developer, ILCA, rather than Game Freak. The developers revealed that the games would not assume the anticipated style of the Let's Go Games and feature traditional game mechanics. Pokémon intends to celebrate their 25th anniversary with the release of the remakes by revisiting old games and mechanics, which they faithfully reproduced with enhanced 3D graphics.\nPokémon Legends: Arceus was released on 28 January 2022, for the Switch as a prequel to Diamond and Pearl. It is part of Generation VIII. The game \"represents a new approach for the Pokémon video game series\" as it transitions from traditional RPG mechanics to add real-time elements in their games. Unlike traditional Pokémon games, the player can catch Pokémon by throwing a Poké Ball in real-time rather than triggering a battle; however, they can still choose the latter to weaken it for capture. Many in-game aspects, particularly its landscape, heavily resemble those of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\nGeneration IX was introduced with the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet for the Switch on 18 November 2022. The games are the first Pokémon games to feature an entirely open-world experience as opposed to the partially open-world experience in previous Pokémon games such as Sword and Shield, and it also departed from the traditional gym mechanics and the elite four battles to opt for unique road quests. The games' improved multiplayer experience allowed for up to four players to travel together. Their DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, consists of two parts, The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk; The Teal Mask was released on 12–13 September 2023 and The Indigo Disk was released on 14 December 2023. An epilogue to The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero was released on 11 January 2024.\nOn 27 February 2024, TPCi announced Pokémon Legends: Z-A, set to release in 2025 for the Switch. It is part of Generation IX. A successor to Legends: Arceus, this game acts as a prequel to X and Y.\nBy 2024, the Pokémon franchise had earned a total of 100 billion US dollars, making it the highest-grossing media franchise ever.: 53\n\nMedia\nVideo games\nPokémon video games have been released in a wide variety of genres. The role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak are considered the core series of the franchise. Various spin-off games also exist, such as Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, a roguelike RPG series, Pokémon Ranger, an action RPG series, and Detective Pikachu (2018), an adventure game. Pokémon games, in particular the core RPGs, are commonly classified in generations. For example, Junichi Masuda referred to Diamond and Pearl (2006) as Gen 4, and X and Y (2013) as the 6th generation.\nUntil 2011, Pokémon games were released exclusively on Nintendo's consoles. With the rise of the smartphone during the 2010s, the Pokémon Company also began developing, publishing, and licensing Pokémon titles for the mobile phone market, most notably Pokémon Go (2016), an augmented reality game developed by Niantic that spawned a worldwide craze in the summer of 2016.\nAccording to the official website of the Pokémon Company, as of March 2024, over 480 million Pokémon game units have been sold worldwide.\n\nTrading card game\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game (PTCG) was one of the first collectable card games (CCGs) in Japan. It was inspired by Magic: The Gathering. In the card game, the players use a 60-card deck featuring Basic and evolved Pokémon, Energy cards, and Trainer cards to help them knock out the opponent's Pokémon, drawing prize cards and winning the game. Cards are classified into various levels of rarity, ranging from Common to Rare Holofoil with a holographic illustration. Rare cards, including limited edition, exclusive cards, and older cards, are highly valued among collectors due to their scarcity.\nAccording to the official website of The Pokémon Company, 64.8 billion cards have been produced as of March 2024.\n\nAnime\nAs of 2025, the anime consists of over 1,300 episodes across 8 series in Asia, and 27 seasons internationally. Its newest series, Pokémon Horizons, started airing on 14 April 2023. The anime originally focused on Ash Ketchum and his travels across the Pokémon world with his partner, Pikachu. They were retired as protagonists after the 25th season, and Pokémon Horizons introduced two new protagonists, Liko and Roy. A total of 23 anime films have been released, the most recent being Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle (2021).\nSpin-off series from the anime have also been produced, including a variety show titled Weekly Pokémon Broadcasting Station (週刊ポケモン放送局, Shūkan Pokemon Hōsōkyoku), which aired on TV Tokyo from 2002 to 2004 and aired in English as part of Pokémon Chronicles. Three television specials have been released. 27 short films starring Pikachu were produced, primarily preceding the films. Various animated mini-series also exist.\n\nLive-action\nDetective Pikachu, a live-action/animated film based on the video game of the same name, was released in 2019. A sequel is currently under development.\nA live-action television drama produced by The Pokémon Company and TV Tokyo titled Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde premiered on TV Tokyo on 20 October 2023.\n\nPostage stamps\nIn 2021, the Japan Post released limited edition postage stamps and stamp box. The stamp boxes had promo Pokémon cards that were inspired by the postage stamps Beauty Looking Back and Moon Goose. The postage stamps depicted Pokémon across the four seasons.\nOn 17 June 2024, La Poste (France) issued a booklet of 12 stamps dedicated to Pokémon.\n\nReaction to Pokémania (1999–2000)\nIn 1999 and 2000, Pokémon was an unprecedented, ubiquitous fad in the Western world. Time magazine described it as \"a multimedia and interactive barrage like no other before it\". The franchise, primarily aimed at children, elicited mixed responses from parents and teachers, some of them critical. Yano (2004) even claimed that the reactions at one point constituted a moral panic.\nThe bulk of the criticism on Pokémon was directed at the trading cards, in particular the booster packs, sealed packages of 11 randomly inserted cards that were sold separately from the main sets. The cards are of varying scarcity, the most valuable being the \"holofoil cards\" (also called \"holographic\" or \"foil cards\"), in which the illustrations of the Pokémon have a shiny overlay effect. The rare cards can only be found in booster packs, and the rarest ones are very infrequently included. Tobin (2004) notes that rarity in this case is \"artificially created\", and \"effectively a form of gambling\" in which children need to repeatedly purchase booster packs to get more rare cards. Brougère (2004) described a cynicism among adults that corporations could apparently, \"out of thin air\", ascribe value to cards which they saw as valueless, thereby \"deceiving vulnerable young consumers and garnering excessive profits\".\nAs the franchise's popularity grew, children began taking their Pokémon cards to school for trading and playing. Soon, the cards were alleged to be \"disrupting learning, poisoning playground friendships and causing such distraction that some children forget their homework, tune out in class and even miss school buses as they scramble to acquire one more card\". The cards were \"turning the playground into a black market\", with card swaps sometimes inciting conflicts. Certain children engaged in \"aggressive trading\", tricking other (often younger) kids into unfair deals, forcing teachers to arbitrate. Some parents expressed their concerns about the craze, but feared that their children would be ostracized if they were to deny them Pokémon products. In the US, the Pokémon cards ended up \"almost universally banned\" from school grounds. Similar bans occurred in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and European countries. In September 1999, US-based law firm Milberg filed a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo of America, Wizards of the Coast, and 4Kids. The suit claimed that the booster packs constitute a form of lottery and promote gambling in kids. Susan Estrich noted that similar lawsuits had been filed against trading-card makers in the US, without success. The Pokémon card suit is not known to have gone to court, and is believed to have been settled.\nThe Pokémon anime series was criticized by some as \"cheap Japanese animation\" that is \"violent\" and has \"little educational value\". Michelle Orecklin of Time dismissed the TV series as \"less a cartoon than a half-hour exercise in Pokémon product placement\". Allison (2006) wrote that even those within Pokémon's US marketing team agreed that the anime's visuals were \"not especially sophisticated\" compared to Disney cartoons. Pokémon: The First Movie premiered in the United States on 12 November 1999, and in European countries in February 2000. While a huge box-office success, the film was received negatively by several Western film critics. The Guardian decried it as a \"contemptuously cheap animated cash-in on the monster kids' craze\". The American adult animated series South Park satirized Pokémon in the episode \"Chinpokomon\", aired on 3 November 1999. In the episode, the titular media franchise is portrayed as a low-quality line of products that is part of an evil plan by the Japanese government to invade the US. South Park co-creator Matt Stone commented that, at the time, Pokémon was \"scary huge\".\nKohler (2004) wrote that Pokémon was considered \"ruthlessly commercial\", and that it \"program[med] children to be consumers of anything and everything Pokémon\". CNN quoted child psychiatrist John Lochridge as worrying that \"Pokémon's creators and marketers deliberately set out to create a fantasy world so compelling that children would quickly become obsessed\". He believed that kids were being \"brainwashed\", and said: \"I have had parents tell me that they cannot get their kids to do anything except Pokémon, so this stuff seems to really capture their minds, in a way\". These concerns were countered by psychologist William Damon, who told Newsweek that obsessing is in fact a normal part of a child's neurological development. It should concern parents only when the obsession gets dangerous or excessive. An op-ed in the New Zealander newspaper The Dominion Post claimed that the anti-Pokémon sentiment was particularly American: \"The backlash, which seems largely confined to the United States, may be no more than the sound of the world's leading cultural imperialist gagging on a taste of its own medicine\".\nAs Pokémania built, Western media started reporting on several crimes associated with Pokémon. These included violence (including two reported stabbings), burglaries, robberies (some at knifepoint), and shoplifting. Almost all these incidents were connected to the Pokémon cards, and the individuals involved were almost always underage. In the US, the incidents peaked in November 1999. In England, Pokémon-related delinquency reached a head in April 2000. High prices on the grey market were a motive behind some of the crimes, \"posing a great temptation for older kids and bullies to take advantage of weaker children\". At specialty shops and online auctions, a rare Pokémon card could be bought and sold for $50 or more (c. $94 in 2024).\nAside from the negative reactions, many media also cited alleged beneficial effects of Pokémon. It was noted that the video games and the cards require children to read, memorize, calculate, and plan out a strategy. Both encourage socialization, and trading Pokémon requires negotiating skills. Stephanie Strom wrote in The New York Times that the Pokémon anime taught children \"traditional Japanese values – responsibility, empathy, cooperation, obedience, respect for elders, humility\". Anne Allison interviewed various American parents during Pokémania. She found that while most of them were \"utterly mystified\" about Pokémon, few were overly worried about it, instead meeting the craze with \"befuddled acceptance\". Allison also notes that the Columbine High School massacre occurred during Pokémania (on 20 April 1999), causing violent television, music, and games to be scrutinized. Compared to these media, she notes, Pokémon is in fact rather tame.\nIn contrast, Pokémon received far less criticism in its native country of Japan. Yano (2004) attributes this to cultural differences, which includes: 1) greater acceptance of exuberant consumerism – to buy is to be a good citizen; 2) less focus on media influence – instead, Japan's educational system, bullying, and dysfunctional families are more often the target of attention; 3) less separation between child- and adulthood – what is suitable for adults is not necessarily considered unsuitable for kids; 4) Pokémon being permeated with kawaisa (cuteness), a hallmark of Japanese culture; 5) Japan's core religions, Buddhism and Shinto, are less moralizing in nature. However, Oliver Burkeman wrote in The Guardian that the Pokémon cards were also banned from some Japanese schools.\n\nLegacy and influences\nAfter World War II, Japan experienced a period of unprecedented growth and became well-known in the Western world for its consumer products, such as radios (e.g. Panasonic, Toshiba), cars (e.g. Toyota, Mitsubishi), and Sony's Walkman. From 1991 onwards, its economy stagnated, causing the country to lose its status as an economic superpower. However, during the 1990s and 2000s, Japan re-emerged as a source of 'cool' cultural goods, embraced by a growing international audience interested in Japanese culture. Nintendo, Sega, and Sony launched several popular video game consoles and franchises. In terms of children's properties, the success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers changed perceptions on the viability of such Japanese imports in the West. The Tamagotchi fad (1997–98), centered around a portable digital pet device, was said to have \"paved the way for Pokémon\".\nAnne Allison (2006) wrote that, before the 1990s, Japan figured little in the face of the worldwide hegemony of Euro-American cultural industries, in particular that of the US. \"Hollywood has been hostile to imports\", she wrote, \"and foreignness has largely been, and been seen as, an impediment to mass popularization in the United States\". The surprise success of Pokémon was \"an undeniable breakthrough in the homeland of Disney\" that \"changed preexisting assumptions about the US marketplace at the same time that it was constantly resisted for deviating from them\". Pokémon was a welcomed boon to Japan's faltering economy, and positively influenced the country's soft power. Kamo (2000) interviewed various American children and found that kids who thought Pokémon was cool, were more likely to believe that Japan was a cool nation. Allison (2003) gave a similar finding: all the children she interviewed knew where Pokémon originated, and \"many said that, as a result of Pokémon and other 'cool' Japanese goods, they had developed an interest in Japan. A number said that they now wanted to study Japanese and travel there one day\". Kohler (2004) wrote: \"Japanese are proud of Pokémon, the most successful export of Japanese popular culture ever\". Although, Iwabuchi (2004) questioned to what extent Pokémon really is 'Japanese', and to what extent it is simply a good property with universal appeal. He noted that Japanese nationalist commentators celebrated Pokémon's global success and retrospectively attributed this to its \"Japanese cultural power\", while ignoring the localization of Pokémon overseas, as well as decades of increasing cooperation and cultural exchange between countries (globalization).\nIn the 20th century, anime found niche popularity in North America and Europe in series (Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Speed Racer) and films (Akira, Ghost in the Shell). The Pokémon TV series and films marked a breakthrough for anime, contributing to its growing worldwide success at the turn of the 21st century. For some children, Pokémon was their introduction to 'Japanimation', serving as a \"gateway\" to other anime, manga, and Japanese culture in general. Pokémon: The First Movie became one of the most successful Japanese animated films in history. After Princess Mononoke, Pokémon: The First Movie became the second anime film to open at mainstream cinemas in the West, as opposed to the usual art house venues. Pioneering anime importer John Ledford noted that Pokémon underscored the commercial potential of anime, thus making it interesting from a business perspective.\nIn the field of video games, the main Pokémon series became the standard within the monster-taming game genre, a subtype of RPGs. While not the first to use this concept, the Pokémon games became so synonymous with it that later titles involving catching and training monsters, of any genre, were inevitably compared to Pokémon. Examples of this include Dragon Warrior Monsters (1998), Robopon Sun and Star (1998), Spectrobes (2007), Invizimals (2009), Monster Crown (2021), and Palworld (2024).\nThe success of Pokémon encouraged companies to look for other popular Japanese properties that might be localized for Western markets. The importing of at least three similar franchises were confirmed by business executives to have been (partly) inspired by Pokémon: Yu-Gi-Oh!, Digimon, and Monster Rancher. The import of Cardcaptor Sakura (as Cardcaptors) might also have been prompted by Pokémon.\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nMulti-reference notes\nExternal links\n\nOfficial hub to regional Pokémon websites\nPokémon Center, official merchandise web shop\nOfficial Pokémon GO site",

        "content": "Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He has gained distinction and acclaim for his blending of various genres including hip-hop, pop, R&B, trap, and country. His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator.\nMalone began his musical career in 2011, and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single \"White Iverson\", which peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. He signed with Republic Records to release his debut studio album Stoney (2016), which peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and spawned the diamond-certified single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo). His second album, Beerbongs & Bentleys (2018), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and set numerous streaming records. It contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage) and \"Psycho\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign), and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 61st Grammy Awards. His third Billboard Hot 100 number one single, \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee), was released for the accompanying soundtrack to the 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; it became the highest-certified song in RIAA history as the first to receive double diamond (20-times platinum) certification.\n\"Sunflower\" was also included on Malone's third album, Hollywood's Bleeding (2019), which became his second to peak atop the Billboard 200 and received his second nomination for Album of the Year at the 63rd Grammy Awards. It spawned the single \"Circles\", which became his fourth number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100, and spent 61 weeks on the chart. His fourth and fifth albums, Twelve Carat Toothache (2022) and Austin (2023), both peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and saw continued success; the former spawned the top ten singles \"I Like You (A Happier Song)\" (featuring Doja Cat) and \"One Right Now\" (with the Weeknd), while the latter explored pop rock and spawned the top 15 single, \"Chemical\". Two of his 2024 singles debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100: his guest appearance on Taylor Swift's \"Fortnight\", and his first country pop song, \"I Had Some Help\" (featuring Morgan Wallen). The latter served as lead single for his sixth album, F-1 Trillion (2024), which further experimented with the genre and became his third non-consecutive number one album on the Billboard 200.\nMalone is among the best-selling music artists, with over 80 million records sold. His accolades include eleven Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, six MTV Video Music Awards, and eighteen Grammy Award nominations. He holds several Billboard chart records: He is the first solo lead artist to top both the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while \"Circles\" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist. As of 2025, Malone holds the record for the artist with the most diamond-certified songs, with nine to his name.\n\nEarly life\nAustin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys football team. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.\nMalone has expressed his affinity for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterwards he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.\n\nCareer\n2011–2016: Career beginnings and Stoney\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\". The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\". At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone released his first mixtape, Y.A.T.R., also known as  Young and After Them Riches, in 2014. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".\nMalone later enrolled in Tarrant County College, but dropped out. After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together. Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in the San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including \"White Iverson\". Malone recorded the song two days after writing it. The lyrics of \"White Iverson\" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson. In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone's SoundCloud account. On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for \"White Iverson\". The single received praise from Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa. However the song was mocked by Earl Sweatshirt.\n\nAfter hitting one million views within a month of releasing \"White Iverson\", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels.

He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction.\" However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape as well as his upcoming album were both hip-hop. In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4, and was finally released on December 13. Malone later went on to call the album \"mediocre\", despite the success of the single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo), Malone's first top-ten song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eight. Stoney also featured the top 100 hits \"I Fall Apart\", and \"Deja Vu\" (featuring Bieber), with the album later being certified double platinum by the RIAA in October 2017.\n\n2017–2019: Beerbongs & Bentleys and Hollywood's Bleeding\nIn February 2017, Malone revealed the title of his next project, Beerbongs & Bentleys, and was set to be released in December, before eventually being pushed back to 2018.

Newonce, however, denied that claim, stating that Malone barely drank at all during the interview. In the follow-up Malone went on to say, \"What I was saying was that when I wanna sit down and cry, I sit down and I listen to Bob Dylan and his guitar. Just like everyone else, no matter how hard you are, no matter where you're from, you're gonna have times where you sit back and reflect on your life and you listen to what you wanna listen to.

Malone later said that he was \"not on drugs and I feel the best I've ever fucking felt in my life\". His manager Dre London likewise claimed there was no need to worry and that Malone's behavior was part of the \"act\".

Some Susquehannock survivors also joined them, and assimilated. Anglo-Americans called these migrants mingos, a corruption of mingwe, an Eastern Algonquian name for Iroquoian-language groups in general. The Mingo have also been called \"Ohio Iroquois\" and \"Ohio Seneca\".\nMost were forced to move from Ohio to Indian Territory in the early 1830s under the federal Indian Removal program. At the turn of the 20th century, they lost control of communal lands when property was allocated to individual households in a government assimilation effort related to the Dawes Act (1887) and extinguishing Indian claims to prepare for the admission of Oklahoma as a state (1907).\nIn the 1930s, Mingo descendants reorganized as a tribe with self-government. They were recognized by the federal government in 1937 as the Seneca–Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma.\n\nHistory\nThe etymology of the name Mingo derives from the Delaware (Lenape) word, mingwe or Minque, as adapted from their Algonquian language, meaning \"stealthy\". In the 17th century, the terms Minqua or Minquaa were used interchangeably to refer to the five nations of the Iroquois League and to the Susquehannock, another Iroquoian-speaking people. \nThe Mingo had a bad reputation and were sometimes called \"Blue Mingo\" or \"Black Mingo\" for their misdeeds. The people who became known as Mingo migrated to the Ohio Country along the river in the mid-eighteenth century, part of a movement of various Native American tribes away from European pressures to a region that had been sparsely populated for decades but controlled as a hunting ground by the Iroquois League of the Five Nations. The \"Mingo dialect\" that dominated the Ohio valley from the late 17th to early 18th centuries is considered a variant most similar to the Seneca language.\nAfter the French and Indian War (1754-1763), France was defeated and ceded its lands east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain. Many Cayuga people of the Five Nations also moved to Ohio, where the British granted them a reservation along the Sandusky River. They were joined there by the Algonquian-speaking Shawnee of Ohio and the rest of the Mingo confederacy. Their villages were increasingly an amalgamation of Iroquoian-speaking Seneca, Wyandot, and Susquehannock; Siouan-language speaking Tutelo and Algonquian-language Shawnee and Delaware migrants.\nAlthough the Iroquois Confederacy had claimed hunting rights and sovereignty over much of the Ohio River Valley since the late 17th century, these peoples in Ohio increasingly acted independently. When Pontiac's Rebellion broke out in 1763 against the British at the end of the French and Indian War, many Mingo joined with other tribes in an attempt to drive the British out of the Ohio Country.  At that time, most of the six Iroquois nations based in New York (who then numbered six, as the Tuscarora had joined them from the South about 1722) were closely allied to the British because of their lucrative fur trading. Guyasuta (c. 1725–c. 1794), a chief of the Mingo-Seneca, was one of the leaders in Pontiac's War.\nAnother famous Mingo leader was Chief Logan (c. 1723–1780), who had good relations with neighboring white settlers. He was not a war chief, but a village leader. In 1774, as tensions between whites and Indians were on the rise due to a series of violent conflicts, a band of white outlaws murdered his family.  Local chiefs counseled restraint, but acknowledged his right to revenge. He conducted a series of raids against white settlers with a dozen followers, not all of whom were Mingo.\nLogan did not participate in the resulting Lord Dunmore's War. He was not likely to have been at the climactic Battle of Point Pleasant. Rather than take part in the peace conference, he expressed his thoughts about the encroachment by Europeans in \"Logan's Lament.\"  His speech was printed and widely distributed. It is one of the most well-known examples of Native American oratory.\nBy 1830, the Mingo were flourishing in western Ohio, where they had improved their farms and established schools and other civic institutions.  After the US passed the Indian Removal Act in that same year, the government pressured the Mingo to sell their lands and migrate west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, which they did in 1832. In Kansas, the Mingo joined other Seneca and Cayuga bands, and the tribes shared the Neosho Reservation.\nIn 1869, after the American Civil War, the US government pressed for Indian removal of these tribes from Kansas to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).  The three tribes moved to present-day Ottawa County, Oklahoma. In 1881, a band of Cayuga from Canada joined the Seneca in Indian Territory. In 1902, several years before Oklahoma Territory was admitted as a state, 372 members of the joint tribe received individual land allotments under a federal program to extinguish communal tribal land holdings so that statehood could take place, and to encourage assimilation to the European-American model. This resulted in considerable loss of their lands in the following decades.\nIn 1937 after the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act was passed, the descendants of these tribes reorganized to re-establish self-government. They identified as the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma and became federally recognized. \nToday, the tribe numbers over 5,000 members. They continue to maintain cultural and religious ties to the Six Nations of the Iroquois, which have been based largely in Ontario, Canada since after the American Revolutionary War. At the time, Great Britain ceded its territory south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the newly independent American states, including most of the lands controlled by the Iroquois in New York and Pennsylvania. Some of the Six Nations also have bands with reservations in New York State, their original homeland. In the US, these governments are recognized as separate tribes.\n\nIn popular culture\nLogan and the Mingo in the period following Lord Dunmore's War are featured prominently in the Gothic novel Logan (1822) by John Neal. The story can be read as issuing an indictment of American imperialism by depicting Indigenous genocide as central to the American story.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nCobb, William H., Andrew Price and Hu Maxwell (1921), History of the Mingo Indians, Cumberland, Md.: F.B.

        "content": "A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a video game that combines aspects of a role-playing video game and a massively multiplayer online game.\nAs in role-playing games (RPGs), the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions. MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game.\nMMORPGs are played throughout the world. Global revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005, and the western world's revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006. In 2008, the spending on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew to $1.4 billion. World of Warcraft, a popular MMORPG, had over 10 million subscribers as of November 2014. World of Warcraft's total revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars in 2014. Star Wars: The Old Republic, released in 2011, became the world's \"fastest-growing subscription MMO in history\" after gaining more than 1 million players within the first three days of its launch.\n\nCommon features\nAlthough modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These include several common features:\n\npersistent game environment\nsome form of level progression\nsocial interaction within the game\nin-game culture\nmembership in a group\ncharacter customization.\n\nThemes\nThe majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional fantasy themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of Dungeons & Dragons. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of science fiction, sword and sorcery, or crime fiction. Others draw thematic material from American comic books, the occult, and other genres. These elements are often developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving quests, monsters, and loot.\n\nProgression\nIn nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player's character is the primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system, in which players earn experience points for their actions and use those points to reach character \"levels\", which makes them better at whatever they do. Traditionally, combat with monsters and completing quests for non-player characters, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs. This is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the level treadmill, or \"grinding\". The role-playing game Progress Quest was created as a parody of this trend. Eve Online, a space-based MMORPG, uses an alternative method of progression where users train skills in real-time rather than using experience points as a measure of progression.\nIn some MMORPGs, there is no limit to a player's level, allowing the grinding experience to continue indefinitely. MMORPGs that use this model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on the game's website or posting their stats on a high score screen. Another common practice is to enforce a maximum reachable level for all players, often referred to as a level cap. Once reached, the definition of a player's progression changes. Instead of being awarded primarily with experience for completing quests and dungeons, the player's motivation to continue playing will be replaced with collecting money and equipment.\nOften, the widened range of equipment available at the maximum level will have increased aesthetic value to distinguish high ranking players in game between lower ranked players. Colloquially known as endgame gear, this set of empowered weapons and armor adds a competitive edge to both scripted boss encounters as well as player vs player combat. Player motivation to outperform others is fueled by acquiring such items and is a significant determining factor in their success or failure in combat-related situations.\n\nSocial interaction\nMMORPGs almost always have tools to facilitate communication between players. Many MMORPGs offer support for in-game guilds or clans, though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not.\nIn addition, most MMOGs require some degree of teamwork in parts of the game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the group, such as protecting other players from damage (called tanking), \"healing\" damage done to other players or damaging enemies.\nMMORPGs generally have Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently referred to as GMs or \"mods\"), who may be paid employees or unpaid volunteers who attempt to supervise the world. Some GMs may have additional access to features and information related to the game that are not available to other players and roles.\nRelationships formed in MMORPGs can often be just as intense as relationships formed between friends or partners met outside the game, and often involve elements of collaboration and trust between players.\n\nRoleplaying\nMost MMORPGs provide different types of classes that players can choose. Among those classes, a small portion of players choose to roleplay their characters, and there are rules that provide functionality and content to those who do. Community resources such as forums and guides exist in support of this play style.\nFor example, if a player wants to play a priest role in his MMORPG world, that player might buy a cope from a shop and learn priestly skills, proceeding to speak, act, and interact with others as their character would. This may or may not include pursuing other goals such as wealth or experience. Guilds or similar groups with a focus on roleplaying may develop extended in-depth narratives using the setting and resources similar to those in the game world.\n\nCulture\nOver time, the MMORPG community has developed a sub-culture with its own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of social rules and taboos. Players will often complain about 'grind' (a slang term for any repetitive, time-consuming activity in an MMORPG), or talk about 'buffs' and 'nerfs' (respectively an upgrade or downgrade of a particular game mechanic).\nAs with all such cultures, social rules exist for such things as invitations to join an adventuring party, the proper division of treasure, and how a player is expected to behave while grouped with other players.\n\nSystem architecture\nMost MMORPGs are deployed using a client–server system architecture. The server software generates a persistent instance of the virtual world that runs continuously, and players connect to it via a client software. The client software may provide access to the entire playing world, or further 'expansions' may be required to be purchased to allow access to certain areas of the game. EverQuest and Guild Wars are two examples of games that use such a format. Players generally must purchase the client software for a one-time fee, although an increasing trend is for MMORPGs to work using pre-existing \"thin\" clients, such as a web browser.\nDepending on the number of players and the system architecture, an MMORPG might be run on multiple separate servers, each representing an independent world, where players from one server cannot interact with those from another; World of Warcraft is a prominent example, with each separate server housing several thousand players. In many MMORPGs the number of players in one world is often limited to around a few thousand, but a notable example of the opposite is EVE Online, which accommodates several hundred thousand players on the same server, with over 60,000 playing simultaneously (June 2010) at certain times. Some games allow characters to appear on any world, but not simultaneously (such as Seal Online: Evolution or Kolossium competition in Dofus); others limit each character to the world in which it was created. World of Warcraft has experimented with \"cross-realm\" (i.e. cross-server) interaction in player vs player \"battlegrounds\", using server clusters or \"battlegroups\" to co-ordinate players looking to participate in structured player vs player content such as the Warsong Gulch or Alterac Valley battlegrounds. Additionally, patch 3.3, released on December 8, 2009, introduced a cross-realm \"looking for group\" system to help players form groups for instanced content (though not for open-world questing) from a larger pool of characters than their home server can necessarily provide.\n\nBusiness models\nMMORPGs today use a wide range of business models, from free of charge, free with microtransactions, advertise funded, to various kinds of payment plans. Some MMORPGs require payment or a monthly subscription to play. By definition, \"massively multiplayer\" games are always online, and most require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development purposes. Some games, such as Guild Wars, have disposed of the 'monthly fee' model entirely, and recover costs directly through sales of the software and associated expansion packs. Still others adopt a micropayment model where the core content is free, but players are given the option to purchase additional content, such as equipment, aesthetic items, or pets. Games that make use of this model often have originated in Korea, such as Flyff and MapleStory. This business model is alternately called \"pay for perks\" or \"freemium\", and games using it often describe themselves with the term \"free-to-play\".\n\nFree-to-play (F2P) means that there is no cost to purchase the software and there is no subscription charge. Variably applies to traditionally bought and forever available games (see Buy-to-play below). Most newer MMOs that fall under this category now includes microtransactions however, which causes them to overlap with the Freemium model.\nFreemium (a portmanteau of free-to-play and premium) means that the majority or all of the game's content is available for free but players can pay for extra content, character customization, added perks or faster advancement into the game via microtransactions. Freemium thus overlaps with both the free-to-play and pay-to-play models.\nBuy-to-play (B2P) means that the MMO can only be played by purchasing the game, but there is no subsequent subscription fee for playing the game. These games may or may not include additional microtransactions, or may sell additional content in the form of expansions instead of asking for an ongoing subscription fee.\nPay-to-play (P2P) means that the MMO requires a monthly subscription fee or other ongoing fee in order to continue playing the game. It may also require an up-front purchase of the game in addition to the monthly subscription fee, though many of these up-front purchases include a month of game time. This was once the most common way for MMOs to finance themselves, but has fallen out of favor in recent years as an increasing number of games have switched to other business models due to difficulty in retaining a stable playerbase.\n\nHistory\nMMORPG is a term coined by Richard Garriott to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities. Previous to this and related coinages, these games were generally called graphical MUDs; the history of MMORPGs traces back directly through the MUD genre. Through this connection, MMORPGs can be seen to have roots in the earliest multi-user games such as Mazewar (1974) and MUD1 (1978). 1985 saw the release of a roguelike (pseudo-graphical) MUD called Island of Kesmai on CompuServe and Lucasfilm's graphical MUD Habitat. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG was Neverwinter Nights, which was delivered through America Online in 1991 and was personally championed by AOL President Steve Case. Other early proprietary graphical online RPGs include three on The Sierra Network: The Shadow of Yserbius in 1992, The Fates of Twinion in 1993, and The Ruins of Cawdor in 1995. Another milestone came in 1995 as NSFNET restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly \"massively\"-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with Meridian 59 in 1996, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with The Realm Online appearing nearly simultaneously. Ultima Online, released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre, though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999's EverQuest and Asheron's Call in the West and 1996's Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds in South Korea.\nThe financial success of these early titles has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on consoles and in new settings. In 2008, the market for MMORPGs had Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft dominating as the largest MMORPG, alongside other titles such as Final Fantasy XIV and Guild Wars 2, though an additional market exists for free-to-play MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in South Korea such as MapleStory, Rohan: Blood Feud, Atlantica Online and Lost Ark. Also, there are some free-to-play games, such as RuneScape and Tibia, where the game is free, but one would have to pay monthly to play the game with more features. Guild Wars and its sequel avoid some degree of competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play.\n\nDevelopment\nThe cost of developing a competitive commercial MMORPG title often exceeded $10 million in 2003. These projects require multiple disciplines within game design and development such as 3D modeling, 2D art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database architecture, and network infrastructure.\nThe front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics. As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing 3D engines, real-time shader techniques and physics simulation. The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.\nDeveloping an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security, and database design. MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks. The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections, prevent cheating, and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game. A system for recording the games data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.\nMaintenance requires sufficient servers and bandwidth, and a dedicated support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to lag and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch. Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. Peer-to-peer MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for cheating) can make them a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.\nIn addition, the development team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics, as well as what makes games fun.\n\nNon-corporate development\nThough the vast majority of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many small teams of programmers and artists have contributed to the genre. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or \"indie\") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres. Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.\nSome independent MMORPG projects are completely open source, while others feature proprietary content made with an open-source game engine. The WorldForge project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs. The Multiverse Foundation has also created a platform specifically for independent MMOG developers.\n\nTrends\nAs there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively state that the genre is heading in one direction or another. Still, there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the raid group quest, or \"raid\", which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).\n\nInstance dungeons\nInstance dungeons, sometimes shortened to \"instances\", are game areas that are \"copied\" for individual players or groups, which keeps those in the instance separated from the rest of the game world. This reduces competition, and also reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, reducing lag. The Realm Online was the first MMORPG to begin to use a rudimentary form of this technique and Anarchy Online would develop it further, using instances as a key element of gameplay. Since then, instancing has become increasingly common. The \"raids\", as mentioned above, often involve instance dungeons. Examples of games which feature instances are World of Warcraft, The Lord of the Rings Online, EverQuest, EverQuest II, Aion, Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars, Rift, RuneScape, Star Trek Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and DC Universe Online.\n\nPlayer-created content\nIncreased amounts of \"player-created content\" is another trend.\n\nUse of licenses\nThe use of intellectual property licensing common in other video game genres has also appeared in MMORPGs. 2007 saw the release of The Lord of the Rings Online, based on J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Other licensed MMORPGs include The Matrix Online, based on the Matrix trilogy of films, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, based on Games Workshop's table top game, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online and Age of Conan.\nAdditionally, several licenses from television have been optioned for MMORPGs, for example Star Trek Online and Stargate Worlds (which was later canceled).\n\nConsole-based MMORPGs\nThe first console-based MMORPG was Phantasy Star Online for the Dreamcast. The first console-based open-world MMORPG was Final Fantasy XI for the PlayStation 2.\nEverQuest Online Adventures, also on the PlayStation 2, was the first console MMORPG in North America.\nAlthough console-based MMORPGs are considered more difficult to produce, the platform is gaining more attention.\n\nBrowser-based MMORPGs\nWith the popularization of Facebook and microtransactions came a wave of Flash and HTML5 based MMORPGs that use the free to play model. They require no download outside of a browser and usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features.\n\nSmartphone-based MMORPGs\nSmartphones with their GPS capabilities (amongst others) enable augmented reality in games such as Ingress and Pokémon Go. The games are enhanced by location and distance based tracking, bench marking goals or facilitating trade between players.\n\nIn society and culture\nPsychological effects\nSince the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are virtual, psychologists and sociologists are able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research. Sherry Turkle has found that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring the many different roles (including gender identities) that MMORPGs allow a person to explore.\nNick Yee has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past several years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless; and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) doing things that are external to gameplay but part of the metagame.\nMany players report that the emotions they feel while playing an MMORPG are very strong, to the extent that 8.7% of male and 23.2% of female players in a statistical study have had an online wedding. Other researchers have found that the enjoyment of a game is directly related to the social organization of a game, ranging from brief encounters between players to highly organized play in structured groups.\nIn a study by Zaheer Hussain and Mark D. Griffiths, it was found that just over one in five gamers (21%) said they preferred socializing online to offline. Significantly more male gamers than female gamers said that they found it easier to converse online than offline. It was also found that 57% of gamers had created a character of the opposite gender, and it is suggested that the online female persona has a number of positive social attributes.\nA German fMRT-study conducted by researchers of the Central Institute of Mental Health points towards impairments in social, emotional and physical aspects of the self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players, compared to non-addicted and naive (nonexperienced) people. These findings generally support Davis' cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The high degree of avatar identification found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this study indicates that MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate for impairments in self-concept. Psychotherapeutic interventions should therefore focus on the development of coping strategies for real-life situations in which addicted players tend to experience themselves as incompetent and inferior.\nRichard Bartle, author of Designing Virtual Worlds, classified multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups. His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who developed the concept into the thirty-question Bartle Test that helps players determine which category they are associated with. With over 650,000 test responses as of 2011, this is perhaps the largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players. Based on Bartle and Yee's research, Jon Radoff has published an updated model of player motivation that focuses on immersion, competition, cooperation and achievement. These elements may be found not only in MMORPGs, but many other types of games and within the emerging field of gamification.\nThere have been numerous discussions and evaluations by various scholarly institutions regarding the long-term effects of video game overuse. Many news agencies have criticized video games as promoting violent tendencies in its player base and encouraging anti-social behaviors. Ultimately this  culminated in the World Health Organization classifying the overuse of video games as \"Technological Addiction\" in May 2019.\n\nDisease research\nIn World of Warcraft, a temporary design glitch attracted the attention of psychologists and epidemiologists across North America, when the \"Corrupted Blood\" disease of a monster began to spread unintentionally—and uncontrollably—into the wider game world. The Centers for Disease Control intended to use the incident as a research model to chart both the progression of a disease, and the potential human response to large-scale epidemic infection. However, due to Blizzard Entertainment's failure to keep statistical records of the event, the 2005 Corrupted Blood Outbreak ultimately failed to produce any results. Nevertheless, the CDC has continued to express interest in the use of MMORPGs for disease research.\n\nEducation\nIt has been suggested by Springer University in Germany that MMORPGs encourage and provide opportunities to study and improve in economic theory by providing a controlled environment for the natural development of economic practices between players of including professions, trade, and services.\nResearch has shown that for the positive learner, game-based interaction could reduce inhibition as well as enhance the enjoyment and motivation of second language learning, but appears to be more suitable for learners of intermediate and higher levels of proficiency than language beginners.\n\nTherapeutic applications\nThe Division of Autism and developmental disabilities published a significant report detailing the value of MMORPGs for the treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The report suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder could benefit from MMORPGs by being provided a space to freely develop social skills and communication skills without the stress of face-to-face contact. This in turn opens new pathways for social therapy for individuals with developmental disabilities.\n\nEconomics\nMany MMORPGs feature living economies. Virtual items and currency have to be gained through play and have definite value for players. Such a virtual economy can be analyzed (using data logged by the game) and has value in economic research. More significantly, these \"virtual\" economies can affect the economies of the real world.\nOne of the early researchers of MMORPGs was Edward Castronova, who demonstrated that a supply-and-demand market exists for virtual items and that it crosses over with the real world. This crossover has some requirements of the game:\n\nThe ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game (virtual) currency.\nBartering for items between players for items of similar value.\nThe purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.\nExchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.\nThe invention of user-created meta-currencies such as Dragon kill points to distribute in-game rewards.\nThe idea of attaching real-world value to \"virtual\" items has had a profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the courts. The virtual currency selling pioneer IGE received a lawsuit from a World of Warcraft player for interfering in the economics and intended use of the game by selling WoW gold. Castronova's first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if illegal) currency market existed, with the value of Everquest's in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen. Some people even make a living by working these virtual economies; these people are often referred to as gold farmers, and may be employed in game sweatshops.\nGame publishers usually prohibit the exchange of real-world money for virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange. In Second Life and Entropia Universe, the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked. This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in Entropia, and some players of Second Life have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.\n\nSome of the issues confronting online economies include:\n\nThe use of \"bots\" or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.\nThe use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.\nThe emergence of virtual crime, which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online game, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.\nLinking real-world and virtual economies was rare in MMORPGs as of 2008, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If real-world wealth can be used to obtain greater, more immediate rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay and real game involvement is diminished. It could also easily lead to a skewed hierarchy where richer players gain better items, allowing them to take on stronger opponents and level up more quickly than less wealthy but more committed players.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nJøn, A.

        "content": "Brandon Larned, better known as Seagull, is an American video game streamer and retired professional Overwatch player. Early in the game's history, Larned established himself as one of the most popular Overwatch streamers on Twitch. As an esports competitor, Larned represented Luminosity Gaming and then NRG Esports, before leaving the active roster of the latter to resume streaming full-time. He returned to competitive play with Team EnVyUs shortly before its roster became the Dallas Fuel, one of the teams in the newly launched Overwatch League. At the end of the League's inaugural season, Larned once again announced that he would be stepping away from competitive play in favor of being a full-time streamer.\n\nCareer\nEarly career\nPrior to his transition to Overwatch, Larned was a competitive Half-Life 2 Deathmatch and Team Fortress 2 player. In Team Fortress 2, Seagull was a respected player, specializing in the Soldier character class, and was a member of the tournament competition team Classic Mixup.\nLarned was invited to Overwatch's public beta, and during the beta he began streaming the game – playing the game for, and while interacting with, a live online audience – on Twitch. While his initial expectation was that he would not attract a significant number of viewers, by mid-2016 his streams were regularly attracting 30,000 concurrent viewers, making him one of the game's most popular figures.\nIn addition to streaming, Larned was a member of the team Not Enigma during the game's beta. He then went on to co-found the team Mixup, alongside fellow former-Team Fortress 2 players Yomar \"Milo\" Toledo, Carl \"Enigma\" Yangsheng, Anthony \"Harbleu\" Ballo, Brian \"Pierow\" Alesandr, and James \"Esper\" Southall. A month prior to Overwatch's official release, the Mixup roster was signed to Luminosity Gaming, an organization that fields teams across several esports, using their players' popularity to attract sponsors, and paying their players salaries in return. Larned became Luminosity's star player, and by May 2016 the team had amassed a 60% win-rate over 56 tournament games, good enough to be considered the second-best North American team behind Cloud9, and the fourth-best team in the world.\n\nNRG\nOn July 24, 2016, Shaquille O'Neal, a co-owner of NRG Esports, sent a tweet directed at Larned, inviting him and his team to join O'Neal's organization. A week later, Luminosity announced that Larned and his teammates had declined to renew their contracts, and on August 4, 2016, NRG announced that they had signed Larned. Larned was joined on NRG by four other former ex-Luminosity players; Milo and Enigma from the original Mixer roster, as well as Daniel \"Gods\" Graeser and Mark \"Pookz\" Rendon, who joined the team later on. The sixth player, Tim \"Dummy\" Olson, played for another multi-esport organization, Team Liquid, before joining NRG. Throughout 2016 NRG remained a popular team, despite lacking top results in tournament play. In October of that year they were one of four non-Korean teams to receive invitations to Season 1 of the Korean OGN APEX tournament.\nIn the 2016 Overwatch World Cup, fans from each participating nation selected four of their team's six players through a vote, with the player receiving the most votes becoming the captain. The captain then selected the remaining two players on their team. Larned received 57% of the vote, 24% higher than the next most-voted American player, and was named captain of the United States team. The United States team were knocked out by eventual tournament winners South Korea, who named the United States team as their toughest challenge.\nIn April 2017, Larned stepped down from the active roster of NRG, remaining on the team as a substitute and as a streamer under their brand. Larned tweeted that he was struggling to juggle his roles as a competitive tournament player and as a streamer, and mentioned that, with the Overwatch League set to launch in a few months, the number of tournaments available for him to compete in had decreased significantly.\n\nEnVyUs and Dallas Fuel\nLarned went on to join Team EnVyUs in September of that year. EnVyUs was already one of the most successful teams in the world, with several major tournament wins, including the season of OGN APEX that Larned competed in. Larned claimed that several teams were vying for his signature, and picking EnVyUs was an incredibly difficult decision, but that he accepted their offer because of the team's culture, history of winning, and strong organization. He joined as a rotation player, with the team owner explaining that players would be rotated in and out on a per-map basis. The team immediately went on to win the inaugural season of the Contenders North America tournament, going undefeated over the six-week event.\nThe same month that Larned signed with EnVyUs, Overwatch publisher Blizzard Entertainment announced that EnVyUs had purchased a franchise slot in the Overwatch League, and would compete as the Dallas Fuel. Larned was announced as a member of the Fuel roster the following month.\nThe Dallas Fuel entered the inaugural season with high expectations. ESPN placed them as fourth out of the 12 teams in their preseason rankings, PC Gamer placed them third, and several other rankings also had them in the top four. However, the team struggled extensively, ending the season with 12 wins and 28 losses. Several suspensions and the eventual release of starting tank player Félix \"xQc\" Lengyel and internal conflict among players hampered the team, especially early in the season; half of the team's 12 wins were in the final ten games.\nOn August 7, 2018, Larned announced that he would once again be retiring from competitive play to focus on streaming, stating that during his time on the Fuel, he gained 40 pounds and developed sleep apnea.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri",
        "content": "Onigiri (お握り or 御握り), also known as omusubi (お結び) or nigirimeshi (握り飯), is a Japanese rice ball made from white rice. It is usually formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes, and wrapped in nori (seaweed). Onigiri traditionally have sour or salty fillings such as umeboshi (pickled Chinese plum), salted salmon, katsuobushi (smoked and fermented bonito), kombu, tarako or mentaiko (pollock roe), or takanazuke (pickled Japanese giant red mustard greens). Because it is easily portable and eaten by hand, onigiri has been used as portable food or bento from ancient times to the present day. Originally, it was used as a way to use and store left-over rice, but it later became a regular meal. Many Japanese convenience stores and supermarkets stock onigiri with various fillings and flavors. It has become so mainstream that it is even served in izakayas and sit-down restaurants. There are even specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide.\nOnigiri is not a form of sushi and should not be confused with the type of sushi called nigirizushi or simply nigiri. Onigiri is made with plain rice (sometimes lightly salted), while sushi is made of rice with vinegar, sugar and salt. Onigiri makes rice portable and easy to eat as well as preserving it, while sushi originated as a way of preserving fish.\n\nHistory\nPrehistoric\nOn November 12, 1987, lumps of carbonized grains of rice, thought to be riceballs, were excavated from a building belonging to the Yayoi period (2000 years ago) in the Sugitani Chanobatake Ruins in Ishikawa Prefecture. The carbonized rice had traces which revealed that it was formed by human hands, thus it was initially documented as \"the oldest onigiri.\" In subsequent research, it was thought to be steamed and grilled, rather than boiled like today's rice, similar to another dish called chimaki. Since then, it has been academically called the \"chimaki-shaped carbonized rice lumps (チマキ状炭化米塊)\".\nIn Nakanoto, there is a replica of the relic on display at the roadside station Orihime-no-sato Nakanoto.\n\nPre-modern\nBefore the use of chopsticks became widespread, in the Nara period, rice was often rolled into a small ball so that it could be easily picked up. In the Heian period, rice was made into small rectangular shapes known as tonjiki so that they could be piled onto a plate and easily eaten. At that time, onigiri were called tonjiki and often consumed at outdoor picnic lunches.\nThe first incarnation of the word onigiri is attested in the Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki (Hitachi Province Gazette), dated to 721 AD. In it, the word used is nigiri-ihi (握飯) or \"crumpled rice\":\n\nIn Murasaki Shikibu's 11th-century diary Murasaki Shikibu Nikki, she writes of people eating tonjiki rice balls. Other writings, dating back as far as the seventeenth century, state that many samurai stored rice balls wrapped in bamboo sheath as a quick lunchtime meal during war.\nFrom the Kamakura period to the early Edo period, onigiri was used as a quick meal. This made sense as cooks simply had to think about making enough onigiri and did not have to concern themselves with serving. These onigiri were simply balls of rice flavored with salt. Nori did not become widely available until the Genroku era (1688–1704) of the mid-Edo period, when the farming of nori and fashioning it into sheets became widespread.\n\nModern\nIn the 1980s, a machine to make triangular onigiri was invented. Rather than rolling the filling inside, the flavoring was put into a hole in the onigiri and the hole was hidden by nori. Since the onigiri made by this machine came with nori already applied to the rice ball, over time the nori became moist and sticky, clinging to the rice.\nA packaging improvement allowed the nori to be stored separately from the rice. Before eating, the diner could open the packet of nori and wrap the onigiri. The use of a hole for filling the onigiri made new flavors of onigiri easier to produce as this cooking process did not require changes from ingredient to ingredient. Modern mechanically wrapped onigiri are specially folded so that the plastic wrapping is between the nori and rice to act as a moisture barrier. When the packaging is pulled open at both ends, the nori and rice come into contact and are eaten together. This packaging is commonly found for both triangular onigiri and rolls (細巻き).\n\nRice and shapes\nUsually, onigiri is made with boiled white rice, though it is sometimes made with different varieties of cooked rice, such as:\n\nOkowa or kowa-meshi: glutinous rice cooked or steamed with vegetables\nSekihan: rice cooked with red azuki beans\nMaze-gohan: rice cooked with various preferred ingredients\nFried rice\nBrown rice\nThe rice may be seasoned with salt, sesame, furikake, dried shiso flakes, and so on. Onigiri are typically triangular, but can come in many shapes, including round, cylindrical, rectangular, etc.\n\nFillings\nUmeboshi, okaka, or tsukudani have long been frequently used as fillings for onigiri. Generally, onigiri made with pre-seasoned rice is not filled with ingredients. Plain (salt only) onigiri is called shio-musubi.\nTypical fillings are listed below:\n\nDressed dishes: tuna with mayonnaise (シーチキン), shrimp with mayonnaise, negitoro (ネギトロ), etc.\nDried fish: roasted and crumbled mackerel (鯖), Japanese horse mackerel (鰺), etc.\nDried food: katsuobushi, etc.\nFish roe: mentaiko (明太子), tarako (たらこ), tobiko (とびこ), etc.\nShiokara: squid, shuto, etc.\nMeats: kakuni, dongpo pork, char siu\nTsukudani: nori, Hypoptychus dybowskii (小女子), Venerupis philippinarum (浅蜊), etc.\nPickled fruits and vegetables: umeboshi, takana, nozawana, etc.\nTenkasu: deep fried bits of batter\n\nVariants\nYaki-onigiri\nYaki-onigiri (焼きおにぎり \"grilled onigiri\") are first shaped by compacting white rice, then grilling it until brown, then coating with soy sauce or miso, and finally broiling it. Yaki-onigiri is also sold commercially as frozen food.\nMiso-onigiri (味噌おにぎり) is mainly in eastern Japan. Miso is used as fillings, sometimes mixed with green onion, or spread over and roasted as a variant of yaki-onigiri.\n\nAge-onigiri\nAge-onigiri (揚げおにぎり \"fried onigiri\") are first shaped by compacting white rice, then frying it in a frying pan or wok using cooking oil until it is golden brown. Because of the oil, the flavor is richer than yaki-onigiri. If eating it as is, it can be seasoned with soy sauce, miso, or salt.\nTo eat it in a soup, first place it in a bowl. Add condiments such as chives, miyakogusa, wasabi, grated ginger, nori, umeboshi plum, and pour hot Japanese-style soup stock. Eat while breaking up the onigiri that have absorbed the soup stock.\nThere are several variations of the age-onigiri. For example, there is a version where the rice being fried has Japanese flavoring, such as takikomi gohan. There is also a Western style variation where melted cheese is used as the filling, the rice is deep-fried with western ingredients such as ketchup and curry, and the onigiri is topped with a western-style soup.\n\nBakudan-onigiri\nBakudan-onigiri (爆弾おにぎり \"bomb-shaped onigiri\") are large, spherical rice balls wrapped entirely in nori, so that no rice is exposed. Like other onigiri, they are usually filled with dried fish and umeboshi plums. Bakudan-onigiri are known to be simple to make and easy to hold without getting the hands sticky.\n\nPork tamago-onigiri\nPork tamago-onigiri (ポーク玉子おにぎり \"pork egg onigiri\") or onipō (おにポー) for short, is a variation from Okinawa Prefecture which combines rice, seaweed, pork, and eggs. It is similar to onigirazu (rice and lunch meat in sandwich form).\n\nOther\nTenmusu (天むす): rice balls containing fried tempura. Originally from Tsu, Mie, and is well known in Nagoya cuisine.\nSamgak-gimbap (삼각김밥) — Literally \"triangle gimbap\". It originates from Japanese onigiri and is sold in convenience stores in South Korea. Fillings vary greatly; the expiration date is one day; it typically provides between 600 and 850 kilojoules (140 and 200 kcal) of food energy.\n\nTrivia\nOnigiri has its own Unicode emoji: 🍙 (U+1F359)\n\nSee also\nArancini – an Italian dish of fried, breadcrumb-coated rice balls, with various fillings\nCifantuan – Shanghainese rice balls, commonly eaten for breakfast\nJumeokbap – a Korean dish of Japanese onigiri-styled rice balls, with various fillings\nLemper – an Indonesian glutinous rice dish served with abon fillings wrapped in banana leaves\nZongzi – a Chinese glutinous rice dish served with various fillings wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Onigiri at Wikimedia Commons",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOL",
        "content": "LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laughing out loud, and a popular element of Internet slang, which can be used to indicate amusement, irony, or double meanings. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO (\"laughing my ass off\") and ROFL or ROTFL (\"rolling on the floor laughing\").\nIn 2003, the list of acronyms was said to \"grow by the month\", and they were collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication. These initialisms are controversial, and several authors recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications. The Oxford English Dictionary first listed LOL in March 2011.\n\nHistory\nIn the early to mid-1980s, Wayne Pearson was reportedly the first person to have used LOL while responding to a friend's joke in a pre-Internet digital chat room called Viewline. Instead of writing \"hahaha,\" as he had done before when he found something humorous, Pearson stated that he instead typed \"LOL\" to symbolize extreme laughter. Although the account is commonly accepted as true, no written record of the conversation has been found, and the exact date of origin is unknown.: 82–83  The earliest recorded mention of LOL in the contemporary meaning of \"Laughing Out Loud\" was made in a list of common online acronyms on the May 8, 1989 issue of the electronic newsletter FidoNews, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and linguist Ben Zimmer.: 83 \n\nA 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students \"used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons\". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of LOL.On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary. In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for \"little old lady\" in the 1960s.\nGabriella Coleman references \"lulz\" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.\nLOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal – likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century – states that this is \"a brand new variety of language evolving\", invented by young people within five years, that \"extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language\". However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their \"total effect on language\" would be \"utterly trivial\".\nWhile LOL originally meant \"laughing out loud,\" modern usage is different, and it is commonly used for irony, as an indicator of second meanings, and as a way to soften statements.\n\nAnalysis\nSilvio Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Scott Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, \"Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms.\" Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that smileys and abbreviations are \"no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication\".\nLinguist John McWhorter stated, \"Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles...\" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as oh in \"Oh, I don't know\" and uh when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that lol is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.\nFrank Yunker and Stephen Barry, in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting, have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are \"often misunderstood\" by students and are \"difficult to decipher\" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of \"ROFL\" as not obviously being the abbreviation of \"rolling on the floor laughing\" (emphasis added). Matt Haig describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that \"as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing\". Hossein Bidgoli advises that such initialisms should be used \"only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning\" as they \"might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver\", and differences in meaning may lead to misunderstandings in international contexts.\nTim Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of \"annotating text with stage directions\". Peter Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: \"The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.\"\nDavid Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question \"How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?\". Louis Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.\nVictoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that \"a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol\", and opines that \"these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse\". Michael Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, \"or you won't be LOL\".\n\nVariations on the theme\nVariants\nlul: phonetic spelling of LOL. \"LUL\" is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote on Twitch, which depicts game critic TotalBiscuit laughing.\nlolz: Occasionally used in place of LOL.\nlulz: Often used to denote laughter at someone who is the victim of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a New York Times article about Internet trolling, \"lulz means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium.\" Can be used as a noun – e.g. \"do it for the lulz.\", shortened into \"ftlulz\" (to distinguish it from \"ftl\" – \"for the loss\"). See also LulzSec.\nLOLOLOL...: For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of \"OL\". In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., \"Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud\"), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row.\nOMEGALUL and LULW: variants of \"LUL\" used as a Twitch emote.\ntrolololol or trollololol: A blend of troll and LOL iterated, likely meant to mimick Eduard Khil's 1976 song Mr. Trololo song, which became an internet meme in 2010. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as internet trolling.\n\nDerivations\n(to) LOL: Used as a verb (\"to laugh out loud\") and is meant to be conjugated in the appropriate tense. When the past tense is meant, it is written as \"LOL(e)d\" or \"LOL'd\".\nlolwut (sometimes \"lulwut\"): lol + wut, used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion.\nlawl, lawlz, or lal: Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying \"lawl\" is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL and is not meant to express laughter.\nLel or LEL is a \"playful or ironic\" variation of LOL. It is sometimes thought to be an initialism, standing for \"laughing extremely loud\" or \"laughing extra loud\", but this has been disputed.\nlolcat, an image macro of a cat\n\nRelated\n*G* or *g*: For \"grins\". Like \"lulz\" it is used in the initialism \"J4G\" (\"just for grins\").\nkek: A term for laughter that originated in online games, possibly either World of Warcraft or StarCraft, the latter in which Korean players would type \"kekeke\" as onomatopoeia for laughter. It later became associated with alt-right politics, in the form of a parody religion surrounding the character Pepe the Frog by analogy with the frog-headed ancient Egyptian god Kek.\nLMAO: For \"laughing my arse/ass off\". Variants: LMBO (\"Laughing my butt off\"), LMFAO (\"Laughing my fucking ass off\").\nlqtm: For \"Laughing quietly to myself\".\nROFL: For \"rolling on the floor laughing\". It is often combined with LMAO for added emphasis as ROFLMAO (\"Rolling on the floor laughing my ass off\") or ROFLMFAO (Rolling on the floor laughing my fucking ass off).\nroflcopter: A portmanteau of ROFL and helicopter. A popular glitch in the Microsoft Sam text-to-speech engine enables the voice to make a sound akin to the rotation of rotor blades when 'SOI' or 'SOY' is entered, and the phrase 'My ROFLcopter goes soi soi soi...\" is often associated with the term as a result.\nPMSL: For \"pissing myself laughing\".\nIJBOL: For \"I just burst out laughing\". Gaining popularity among Gen Z, initially popularized within the K-pop fandom. Not derived from Korean.\nXD, sometimes stylized as xD, xd, or Xd, is an emoticon commonly used to symbolize extreme laughter or happiness.\n\nCommonly used equivalents in other languages\nPre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is \"hi hi\". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.\n\n555: the Thai variation of LOL. \"5\" in Thai is pronounced \"ha\", three of them being \"hahaha\" (ห้า ห้า ห้า).\nasg: Swedish abbreviation of the term asgarv, meaning intense laughter.\ng: Danish abbreviation of the word griner, which means \"laughing\" in Danish.\njajajá: in Spanish, the letter \"j\" is pronounced /x/.\njejeje: in the Philippines is used to represent \"hehehe\". \"j\" in Filipino languages is pronounced as /h/, derived from the Spanish /x/. Its origins can be traced to SMS language. It is widely used in a Filipino youth subculture known as Jejemons.\nmdr: Esperanto version, from the initials of multe da ridoj, which translates to \"lot of laughs\" in English.\nmdr: French version, from the initials of \"mort de rire\" which roughly translated means \"died of laughter\", although many French people also use LOL instead as it is the most widely used on the internet.\nmkm: in Afghanistan \"mkm\" (being an abbreviation of the phrase \"ma khanda mikonom\"). This is a Dari phrase that means \"I am laughing\".\nptdr: French variant from pété de rire – literally meaning \"broken with laughter\"\nrs: in Brazil \"rs\" (being an abbreviation of \"risos\", the plural of \"laugh\") is often used in text based communications in situations where in English LOL would be used, repeating it (\"rsrsrsrsrs\") is often done to express longer laughter or laughing harder. Also popular is \"kkk\" (which can also be repeated indefinitely), due to the pronunciation of the letter k in Brazilian Portuguese sounding similar to the ca in card, and therefore representing the laugh \"cacacacaca\" (also similar to the Hebrew version below).\nחחח/ההה: Hebrew version of LOL. The letter ח is pronounced [/x/ /x/] and ה is pronounced [/h/ /h/]. Putting them together (usually three or more in a row) makes the word khakhakha or hahaha (since vowels in Hebrew are generally not written), which is in many languages regarded as the sound of laughter.\nㅋㅋㅋ (\"kkk\" or \"kekeke\") and ㅎㅎㅎ (\"hhh\") are usually used to indicate laughter in Korean. 'ㅋ', is a Korean Jamo consonant representing a \"k\" sound, and 'ㅎ' represents an \"h\" sound. Both \"ㅋㅋㅋ\" and \"ㅎㅎㅎ\" represent laughter which is not very loud. However, if a vowel symbol is written, louder laughter is implied: 하하 \"haha\" 호호, \"hoho.\"\n(笑): in Japanese, the kanji for laugh, is used in the same way as lol. It can be read as kakko warai (literally \"parentheses laugh\") or just wara. w is also used as an abbreviation, and it is common for multiple w to be chained together. The resulting shape formed from multiple wwwww leads to the usage of 草 ( 草 meaning grass, read as kusa), due to its resemblance to the shape of grass.\n\nSee also\nFace with Tears of Joy emoji (😂)\nInternet meme\nLeet\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nConnery, Brian A.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiffTrax",
        "content": "RiffTrax is an American company that produces scripted humorous commentary tracks which are synced to feature films, education shorts (mostly public domain), and television episodes. With the talents of former Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) cast members and writers, RiffTrax also produces several live shows each year which are broadcast to movie theaters. The style of commentating originated from MST3K, their earlier television series, in which they would similarly mock (or \"riff\") films aloud while watching them. As of September 2024, RiffTrax has riffed 554 feature films, 488 short films, and 16 TV episodes.\nThe first releases originally featured Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett, through audio-only tracks intended to be played in unison with unaltered VHS and DVD copies of these programs. After the introduction of already-synced VHS and DVD material, added to the riffers were Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Jones Nelson, who also wrote and performed for the MST3K series. Guest riffers have also added commentaries, including parodist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Cole Stratton and Janet Varney, and actors Joel McHale, Fred Willard, and Neil Patrick Harris, among others.\nRiffTrax products are sold in downloadable media online and delivered by app, streaming video, and DRM-free download. It is also featured on Pluto TV, Twitch, Xumo, Tubi and a channel on Samsung TV.\n\nHistory\nFollowing the cancellation of MST3K, Nelson, Murphy and Corbett attempted to bring the riffing concept to a podcast series known as The Film Crew. During this time, Rhino Entertainment collaborated to produce four riffed films on DVD: Hollywood After Dark, Killers from Space, The Wild Women of Wongo, and The Giant of Marathon.\nAfter the association with Rhino Entertainment and Shout Factory (who distributed The Film Crew DVDs) ended, Nelson and Legend Films started RiffTrax in 2007 based in San Diego. In 2012, RiffTrax was purchased from Legend by Nelson, Murphy, Corbett, and RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin.\nThe movies chosen for Mystery Science Theater 3000 were predominantly low-budget B-movies because the show itself was low budget and producers could only afford films in the public domain or otherwise cheap licenses. Nelson had researched bringing about directly releasing DVDs of films with the commentaries included, then realized this initial idea was not feasible since he would be \"sued out of existence.\" The best way to distribute the commentaries would be to sell them independently of the films, avoiding rights issues.  There would be no legal or monetary restrictions to prevent RiffTrax from producing them, though viewers would have to play their own physical copies of the films at the same time.\n\nThe company originally produced audio-only tracks which were intended to be played in unison with unaltered VHS and DVD copies of these programs. The early RiffTrax were almost all solo efforts on Nelson's part, but it soon became apparent that there was a strong demand for them. Nelson was quickly able to recruit more riffers for the project. Most official RiffTrax (not counting fan-made iRiffs and the spin-off RiffTrax Presents series) have a stable cast of Nelson, Murphy and Corbett, identical to The Film Crew and the three Sci-Fi Channel seasons of MST3K. Guest riffers vary often; other MST3K alumni have been featured, such as Pehl and Jones Nelson, in addition to Internet personalities Richard Kyanka (of Something Awful fame), Josh Fruhlinger (writer of The Comics Curmudgeon) and Chad Vader, as well as actors Harris, Willard, and McHale, and parodist Yankovic. Nelson has said that he would like to bring in other guests.\nThe enthusiasm of guest riffers for the project led to the establishment of RiffTrax Presents, a series of tracks exclusively hosted by guest riffers. The success of the guest format is such that \"Three Riffer Editions\" of some films previously solo riffed by Nelson have been re-produced for VOD services. These feature new riffs by the present lineup, with Nelson having ceased producing solo riffs in 2007.\nMost recent works created by RiffTrax are crafted by a small team of writers; longer works are divided into 20- to 30-minute sections for each writer to rewatch and develop riffs for before assembling the entire work.\nRiffTrax continues to release audio track riffs that can be used to play over the owner's own copy of a film as well as making versions friendly for films offered on online streaming services like Netflix. They have also since expanded to produce full-length video-on-demand riffs for films that have entered the public domain or otherwise have been licensed cheaply, such as Night of the Living Dead and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\nAlong with the feature-length tracks, Corbett, Murphy and Nelson have created riffs for a number of short films, typically educational and safety films, similar to the shorts presented before features on MST3K. These include films by the Jam Handy Organization, Alfred P. Higgins Productions, Coronet Films and ACI Films, amongst others. Because these shorts are in the public domain, they can be downloaded with the commentary already recorded onto them. Shorts are usually released at least once, and often twice, a week.\nIn 2008, RiffTrax launched iRiffs, which allows fans to upload commentaries to be sold on the website. iRiffs users are paid 50% of the net revenue generated by their products. iRiffs differentiates from normal RiffTrax in that both serious and humorous commentaries can be uploaded. In February 2009, a contest was held by RiffTrax, in which a winning iRiffs user would be given $1,000 and a chance to develop a RiffTrax Presents title, receiving instruction and critique from Nelson, Murphy and Corbett. The winners of the contest were Doug Walker, Rob Walker and Brian Heinz of That Guy with the Glasses, who contributed an iRiff of The Lion King. The RiffTrax commentary they produced was for Batman Forever.\nIn October 2015, RiffTrax negotiated the rights to release available MST3K episodes through Vimeo via an all-access subscription plan, with a new re-release uploaded each Monday; individual episodes could also be rented through the site, and in November 2015, RiffTrax also started to sell MST3K episodes on their website. The RiffTrax.com releases contain a newly recorded introduction on each episode by Nelson, Corbett, Murphy, or Jones Nelson and Pehl. A substantial percentage from the episode sales on the RiffTrax website goes to the cast members of MST3K.\nOn July 20, 2021, RiffTrax celebrated its fifteenth anniversary.\nIn October 2024, RiffTrax signed a distribution agreement with streaming service Nebula.\n\nLive shows\nAs part of SF Sketchfest in San Francisco, California, Nelson, Murphy, and Corbett have appeared several times performing live riffs alongside a screening of a film. Early on the team riffed Daredevil and Over the Top (1987) in 2007 and Plan 9 from Outer Space. \"Plan 9\" was shown in the historic Castro Theater. The RiffTrax crew have done live internet broadcasts on Ustream.tv, riffing public domain films and taking viewer questions.\nRiffTrax has teamed with NCM Fathom Events to host special one-night live RiffTrax events. Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy, along with special guests, perform their riffing to a live audience in one theater, which is simultaneously broadcast live to select theaters around the country, except in the Pacific Time zone, where a replay of the broadcast is shown. The first show was performed live at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee on August 20, 2009, where Mike, Kevin, and Bill riffed Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with the short film Flying Stewardess and guest appearances by Veronica Belmont, Jonathan Coulton, and Rich Kyanka of Something Awful. An encore showing was shown on October 8 of that year. The second RiffTrax Live! show in theaters took place on December 16, 2009, where they riffed several Christmas short films, one featuring special guest Weird Al Yankovic. An encore showing was shown in theaters the next day. The third RiffTrax Live! show took place on August 19, 2010, with the trio riffing the cult classic Reefer Madness (its encore showing took place on August 24). A fourth live show riffing House on Haunted Hill, also filmed at the Belcourt, occurred on October 28, 2010, with special guest Paul F. Tompkins. A fifth took place on August 17, 2011, featuring the film Jack the Giant Killer. A sixth took place on August 16, 2012, featuring the film, Manos, The Hands of Fate. A seventh live event took place on October 25, 2012, featuring Birdemic: Shock and Terror. The live event featuring Starship Troopers took place on August 15, 2013. The ninth live event featuring Night of the Living Dead was performed on October 24, 2013 .\nOn February 25, 2013, RiffTrax announced a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to secure the rights to riff Twilight, the first film of The Twilight Saga, for their live show in August 2013. Although the Kickstarter was successful, RiffTrax could not work a deal to secure the rights to Twilight and they, instead, used the funding to secure Starship Troopers.\nOn May 12, 2014, RiffTrax announced another Kickstarter campaign to raise money to secure the rights to the 1998 version of Godzilla. The Kickstarter raised the goal of $100,000 within a day. On May 29, they announced a stretch goal of $250,000 to secure the rights to Anaconda for their Halloween show; the goal was reached on June 10, the day before the Kickstarter's end.\nFor 2015, RiffTrax repeated the Kickstarter approach, successfully funding its four-movie event for the year, dubbed \"The Crappening\". The successful Kickstarter allowed them to riff on The Room, Sharknado 2: The Second One, Miami Connection, and Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny at different live events throughout the year. The Rifftrax riff of The Room was performed live during the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival's series of midnight special events.\nFor 2016, RiffTrax used a Kickstarter campaign to successfully fund their events for the year, meeting their initial goal of $225,000 within four days after the start of the campaign, with $620,999 as the total amount raised. The first event was a riffing of the film Time Chasers on May 5, 2016, and used a high definition remaster of the film provided by its director, David Giancola.\nThe second event was a Mystery Science Theater 3000 cast member reunion on June 28, 2016, and took place in Minneapolis. The format of the reunion was similar to RiffTrax's SF Sketchfest \"Night of the Shorts\" shows, using various educational shorts as riffing material. Alongside Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy, the guests were fellow MST3K cast members Joel Hodgson, Bridget Jones Nelson, Mary Jo Pehl, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, and Jonah Ray.\nThe third event for 2016 was Toho's 1961 Kaiju classic Mothra on August 18, 2016, and featured a brand-new widescreen print.\nThe fourth RiffTrax event was the horror classic Carnival of Souls and took place on October 27, 2016. The print used was the 78-minute colorized version of the film previously released on DVD by Legend Films.\nFor 2017, RiffTrax again used a Kickstarter campaign to successfully fund their events for the year, meeting their initial goal of $250,000 on March 8, 2017, sixteen days into the Kickstarter campaign. The first event was a new riff of Samurai Cop, on April 13, 2017. The second event was the \"Summer Shorts Beach Party\" on June 15, 2017. The format of the show was similar to the shorts shows from the SF Sketchfest \"Night of the Shorts\" and the MST3K Reunion Show. Alongside Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy, the guest riffers were Bridget Jones Nelson, Mary Jo Pehl, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, and Paul F. Tompkins. The third event was the Doctor Who special \"The Five Doctors\", held on August 17, 2017; which, for legal reasons, RiffTrax could not reveal this until the RiffTrax Kickstarter campaign had officially ended.\nRiffTrax had been wanting to do a Doctor Who episode for some time as a way to bridge into its fandom, but had to get permission from the BBC. The BBC had been hesitant, fearing that the nature of RiffTrax may have been mean-spirited, but after seeing some of RiffTrax's work, agreed to the use, feeling it would help promote Doctor Who in America.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the year's live shows were postponed to 2021, and therefore no new campaign was held in the latter year, but RiffTrax experimented with live virtual shows, using films available on Netflix and the Scener app was used by viewers to pay to watch the event. These shows included riffs on the first episode of Stranger Things in July 2020, and the film Starship Troopers in September 2020.\nThe list of live Rifftrax shows is:\n\nTotal Riff Off\nIn conjunction with the National Geographic Channel, Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy created a 3-part television series, \"Total Riff Off\" that aired on the channel on April 1, 2014, and became available to buy as video-on-demand later on the RiffTrax site. Each episode is one hour long featuring the three riffing on older National Geographic footage. According to Nelson, the idea for the series came from a National Geographic producer who was also a fan of RiffTrax. RiffTrax and National Geographic worked together to find the best footage to use.  In 2015, three additional episodes of \"Total Riff Off\" were created (two as 2015 RiffTrax Live Kickstarter rewards), which were also later available for purchase as video-on-demand on the RiffTrax website.\n\nThe Rifftones\nIn August 2008, Nelson, Corbett and Murphy formed a musical trio named The Rifftones, initially to compete in Quick Stop Entertainment's second Masters of Song Fu competition. They won the competition, beating fellow musicians Jonathan Coulton, Paul and Storm and, in the final round, Jason Morris. After the competition, they decided to continue creating songs as The Rifftones, making songs based on the movies they've riffed and releasing two albums of music, which are available on the RiffTrax site.\n\nUse\nRiffTrax commentaries are synchronized at the start of the movie using a cue. To reassure consumers that the MP3 file is synchronized with the film, fictional character and riffer \"DisembAudio\" (voiced by writer Conor Lastowka) speaks occasional lines in exact synchronization with the movie. \"RiffTrax Presents\" commentaries feature a female synchronization voice, Debbie. Though RiffTrax are suggested to be played on an MP3 player or with computer software, they are sold as unrestricted MP3s, allowing users to choose the viewing method that suits them the best. A RiffTrax Player is also offered as a free download for Windows computers.\nThe movies chosen for RiffTrax are based on two criteria: whether the movie lends itself towards a funny riffing, and whether the film is widely available on DVD.  These criteria have resulted in a wide variety of genre and era of movies chosen to be riffed.  The first audio commentary made available through the web site in July 2006 was for the 1989 film Road House, long cited by Nelson as the cheesiest movie ever made.\n\nRiffTrax Player\nThe RiffTrax Player (RiffPlayer) is a program which automatically synchronizes the commentary playback to the DVD playback.  The RiffTrax Player makes use of a commentary MP3 as well as a text file (.sync) containing the synchronization information of the DVD and the commentary. As of February 2015, the RiffTrax Player currently supports Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X Snow Leopard and up.\n\nRiffTrax On Demand\nRiffTrax On Demand features downloadable DRM-free video files of films with RiffTrax commentaries embedded.  RiffTrax On Demand has released many short, public domain, and educational films similar to the ones that MST3K would sometimes mock before a full-length movie began.\n\nFeatured catalog\nVideo game\nIn March 2022, Rifftrax: The Game was announced. Developed with Wide Right Interactive, and was released on May 5, 2022 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S, as well as Steam.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial animated intro by Harry Partridge on YouTube\nHow A Movie Riffing Website Earned So Much Online Popularity",

        "content": "Warcraft is a franchise of video games, novels, and other media created by Blizzard Entertainment. The series is made up of six core games: Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft Rumble. The first three of these core games are in the real-time strategy genre, where opposing players command virtual armies in battle against each other or a computer-controlled enemy. The fourth and best-selling title of the franchise is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), where players control their character and interact with each other in a virtual world.\nExpansion sets were released for Warcraft II (Beyond the Dark Portal), Warcraft III  (The Frozen Throne) and multiple expansions were released for World of Warcraft (The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, Mists of Pandaria, Warlords of Draenor, Legion, Battle for Azeroth, Shadowlands, Dragonflight, and The War Within). World of Warcraft's eleventh and twelfth expansions, Midnight, and The Last Titan, were announced in late 2023.\nAt BlizzCon 2018 on November 2, 2018, Blizzard announced a remaster of Warcraft III entitled Warcraft III: Reforged featuring remodeled characters and graphics with a prospective release in 2019. The game was officially released on January 28, 2020.\nAll games in the series have been set in and around the high fantasy world of Azeroth. Initially, the start of the series focused on the human nations that make up the Eastern Kingdoms, and the Orcish Horde, which arrived in Azeroth via a dark portal, beginning the great wars. The Orcs came from another world, referred to as Draenor, the world that will be shattered into pieces by demonic magics during the events of Warcraft II, thereafter being known as Outland. Later on in the series the world of Azeroth was expanded, revealing the new continents of Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, Kul Tiras, Zandalar, and the Dragon Isles, allowing the introduction of the Night Elves, Tauren, Pandaren, and other major races into the universe. The world of Azeroth also contains the traditional fantasy setting races of elves, dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and trolls.  Unusually for the genre, all of these races are available to be played, whereas trolls and full-blooded orcs are usually presented in fantasy fiction as being solely antagonists for protagonists of the more \"human-friendly\" races.\nThe series spawned several books and other media, covering a broad range of characters and timelines in the Warcraft universe. A collectible card game was published, which offered those who bought booster packs a chance to gain access codes to limited in-game content in World of Warcraft. Comics have been released alongside the books, further covering parts of the universe's storyline. A short-lived, online subscription only magazine was available but later ceased publication after five issues. A film adaptation, Warcraft, was released in 2016.\n\nVideo games\nThe first three games in the Warcraft series, including their expansion packs, were all released on both the PC and Macintosh. All of these games were of the real-time strategy genre. Each game proceeded to carry on the storyline of the previous games, and each introduced new features and content to improve gameplay. The name \"Warcraft\" was proposed by Blizzard developer Sam Didier. It was chosen because \"it sounded super cool\", according to Blizzard co-founder Allen Adham, without any particular meaning attached to it.\nWarcraft II: Tides of Darkness was the first game in the series to feature play over the internet using Battle.net, although this was not included until a later release of the game. Warcraft II was also the first in the series to be re-released as a \"Battle Chest\", a bundled copy of the game containing both the original and expansion. Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos was the first game in the series to feature a Collector's Edition, which all subsequent games have released as well. Warcraft III and World of Warcraft also have both had \"Battle Chests\" released for them subsequent to their initial release. The \"Battle.net\" edition of Warcraft II was also the first to introduce the use of CD keys to the series, requiring each user online to have their own copy of the game in order to be able to connect.\nIn 1998, an adventure game in the series, Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans, was announced as being canceled, having been previously delayed from a 1997 release.\nIn 2004, Blizzard Entertainment moved the series away from the real-time strategy genre and released World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Requiring a subscription fee to be paid to play, it also introduced regular additional content to the series in the form of patches. World of Warcraft gained popularity worldwide, becoming the world's largest subscription-based MMORPG in 2008. The game reached a peak 12 million subscribers worldwide in October 2010. World of Warcraft has had ten expansions as of 2024, with two more announced. During the production of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, Blizzard co-founder Frank Pearce stated that \"If there's a team that's passionate about doing another Warcraft [real-time strategy], then that's definitely something we would consider. It's nothing that we're working on right now, we have development teams working on Cataclysm, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, Diablo III, and when those teams are all off the projects they're working on, they'll be intimately involved in the discussions about what's next\".\nIn 2013, Blizzard announced a new free-to-play online digital collectible card game, originally titled Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, with the beta being available in summer of 2013. In March 2014, Hearthstone was released. In addition to free-to-play basic gameplay Hearthstone contains fee-based features such as additional card packs.\nOn May 3, 2022, Blizzard announced a new Warcraft free-to-play mobile game called Warcraft Arclight Rumble.\nIn 2022, Blizzard and NetEase cancelled an unannounced World of Warcraft mobile spin-off game.\nOn November 3, 2023, Blizzard released the free-to-play mobile tower defense and action strategy game Warcraft Rumble. At BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard Entertainment unveiled three forthcoming expansions to World of Warcraft: The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan. These expansions collectively constitute the Worldsoul saga, a narrative continuum led by Chris Metzen. Blizzard also announced World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Classic and confirming their commitment to a more accelerated timeline for future content drops.\n\nOther media\nTabletop games\nWarcraft: The Board Game – strategic board game from Fantasy Flight Games, based on Warcraft III\nWarcraft: The Roleplaying Game – role-playing game from Sword & Sorcery Studios\nWorld of Warcraft: The Board Game – board game based on World of Warcraft, also by Fantasy Flight Games\nWorld of Warcraft: The Adventure Game – board game based on World of Warcraft, also by Fantasy Flight Games\nWorld of Warcraft Miniatures Game – a miniature war game based on World of Warcraft, by Upper Deck Entertainment.\n\nCollectible card games\nWorld of Warcraft Trading Card Game – 2006–2013\n\nNovels\nWarcraft: Of Blood and Honor (2000)\nWarcraft: Day of the Dragon (2001)\nWarcraft: Lord of the Clans (2001)\nWarcraft: The Last Guardian (2002)\nWarcraft: War of the Ancients (2007)\nThe Well of Eternity (2004)\nThe Demon Soul (2004)\nThe Sundering (2005)\nWorld of Warcraft: Cycle of Hatred (2006)\nWarcraft Archive (2006)\nWorld of Warcraft: The Chronicles of War (2010)\nWorld of Warcraft: Rise of the Horde (2006)\nWorld of Warcraft: Tides of Darkness (2007)\nWorld of Warcraft: Beyond the Dark Portal (2008)\nWorld of Warcraft: Night of the Dragon (2008)\nWorld of Warcraft: Arthas: Rise of the Lich King (2009)\nWorld of Warcraft: Stormrage (2010)\nWorld of Warcraft: The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm (2010)\nWorld of Warcraft: Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects (2011)\nWorld of Warcraft: Wolfheart (2012)\nWorld of Warcraft: Jaina Proudmoore: Tides of War (2012)\nWorld of Warcraft: Vol'jin: Shadows of the Horde (2013)\nWorld of Warcraft: Dawn of the Aspects Parts I-V (2013)\nWorld of Warcraft: Paragons (2014)\nWorld of Warcraft: War Crimes (2014)\nWorld of Warcraft: Destination: Pandaria (2014)\nWorld of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 1 (2016)\nWorld of Warcraft: Illidan (2016)\nWarcraft: Durotan - The Official Film Prequel (2016)\nWarcraft: The Official Novelization (2016)\nWorld of Warcraft: Traveler (2016)\nWorld of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2 (2017)\nWorld of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 3 (2018)\nWorld of Warcraft: Traveller: The Spiral Path (2018)\nWorld of Warcraft: Before the Storm (2018)\nWorld of Warcraft: Traveller: The Shining Blade (2019)\nWorld of Warcraft: Shadows Rising (2020)\nWorld of Warcraft: Sylvanas (2022)\nWorld of Warcraft: Beyond the Dark Portal (2023)\n\nComics\nWorld of Warcraft (2007 – 2009), a series published by DC Comics imprint WildStorm.\nWorld of Warcraft: Ashbringer (2008 – 2009), a four-issue mini-series published by WildStorm.\nWorld of Warcraft: Curse of the Worgen (October 9, 2012)\nWorld of Warcraft: Pearl of Pandaria (September 25, 2012)\nWarcraft Saga Issue 1\nWorld of Warcraft: Dark Riders (May 7, 2013)\nWorld of Warcraft: Bloodsworn (August 13, 2013)\nWorld of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor (2014) a three-issue series published by Blizzard\nWarcraft: Bonds of Brotherhood (2016)\nWorld of Warcraft: Legion (2016) a four-issue series published by Blizzard\n\nManga\nWarcraft: The Sunwell Trilogy, a manhwa series published by Tokyopop.\nDragon Hunt (March 2005)\nShadows of Ice (March 2006)\nGhostlands (March 2007)\nWarcraft: Legends (2008 – 2009), a five-part graphic novel series, which is a continuation from The Sunwell Trilogy.\nWorld of Warcraft: Death Knight (December 1, 2009)\nWorld of Warcraft: Mage (June 1, 2010)\nWorld of Warcraft: Shaman (September 28, 2010)\nWorld of Warcraft: Shadow Wing\nThe Dragons of Outland (June 2010)\nNexus Point (March 2011)\n\nMagazine\nIn 2009, Blizzard announced that it would be releasing a magazine with Future US Ltd. This magazine would be purchasable by online subscription, and not for sale in newsagents or stores, making them collector's items. The magazine released quarterly, and each contained 148 pages. No advertisements were included in the magazine. In September 2011, Blizzard announced that the magazine was ceasing publication. Refunds, plush toys or in-game pets were given to subscribers depending on the outstanding length of subscription.\n\nFilm adaptation\nIn a May 9, 2006 press release, Blizzard Entertainment and Legendary Pictures announced that they would develop a live-action film set in the Warcraft universe. At BlizzCon 2008, according to Mike Morhaime, a script was being written.\nIn January 2013, Duncan Jones was announced to direct the adaptation, from a script by Charles Leavitt. The film was set to begin principal photography in early 2014 with a plot based on the novel Warcraft: The Last Guardian. On July 20, 2013, Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment unveiled a sizzle reel during their San Diego Comic-Con 2013 panel, with Duncan Jones hopping on stage briefly to discuss the project. Production on the film started shooting on January 13, 2014. The first full-length trailer for the film was released on November 6, 2015. Warcraft premiered in Los Angeles on June 6, 2016, and was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on June 10, 2016. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and grossed $439 million worldwide.\n\nHeroes of the Storm\nIn 2015, Blizzard released Heroes of the Storm, a crossover multiplayer online battle arena video game in which players can control various characters from Blizzard's franchises as playable heroes, the majority of which come from the Warcraft universe. The game also features numerous mounts based on mounts or other creatures from World of Warcraft, as well as a battleground based on the PvP zone Alterac Pass. A number of Warcraft-themed skins have been introduced for Heroes of the Storm in the “Echoes of Alterac” event in June 2018. Various soundtracks from World of Warcraft, such as Obsidian Sanctum from Wrath of the Lich King, The Wandering Isle from Mists of Pandaria, and Stormwind theme, are present as background music in the game. Heroes of the Storm is inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a community-created mod based on Warcraft III.\n\nSetting\nLocation\nMost of the Warcraft series takes place on the planet of Azeroth. Other planets in the Warcraft universe include: Draenor (and its sundered remnants, known as Outland), Argus, K'aresh, Mardum (also known as the Shattered Abyss), Xoroth, Rancora, and Nathreza. There are also several metaphysical areas mentioned, including the Emerald Dream, the Elemental Planes, the Twisting Nether, the Great Dark Beyond, and the Shadowlands. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, the first game in the series, takes place in Azeroth.\n\nAzeroth\nAzeroth has four known continents, named the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, and recently rediscovered Pandaria. All continents are separated by the Great Sea. Three major archipelagos also reside in the Great Sea: the Broken Isles; Zandalar, the birthplace of the troll civilization; Kul Tiras, a maritime human nation; and the Dragon Isles, the birthplace of the dragons. In the center of the Great Sea is an enormous, everlasting vortex called the \"Maelstrom\" beneath which lies the aquatic city of Nazjatar, home of the amphibious Naga. Near the Maelstrom lies the volcanic Isle of Kezan, home of the goblins.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms are the primary setting of the first two games (and their expansions) and the first half of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. It is made up of 22 areas or zones. The kingdom of Stormwind lies at the south of the Eastern Kingdoms, south of the dwarven kingdom of Khaz Modan and north of the jungle known as Stranglethorn Vale. The capital city of Stormwind, Stormwind City, is nestled into the northwest of Elwynn Forest, a large forest at the center of the kingdom. The Dwarven capital in Khaz Modan, called Ironforge, is located in Dun Morogh.\nThe former human kingdom of Lordaeron, which successfully headed the human Alliance in Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness but later fell to the Scourge in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, is located north of the southern kingdoms. Underneath the ruined city of Lordaeron now lies the Undercity, capital of the Forsaken, a rebel band of the undead Scourge. The area is now known as Tirisfal Glades and is threatened by the Western Plaguelands held back at The Bulwark. Northeast of Lordaeron is the elven nation of Quel'Thalas and its capital city, Silvermoon, both of which were conquered by the Scourge in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.\nThe continent of Kalimdor was introduced in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and is made up of 18 zones. Whereas the Eastern Kingdoms can be described as the equivalent of medieval Europe, with traditional kingdoms and advanced cities, Kalimdor can be compared to the Americas at the time of the first arrivals of Europeans, full of wild lands. The geography and topography of Kalimdor are similar to North America and Africa, with massive, ancient forests and mountains covering the North and vast deserts and savannahs in the South. The Night Elven kingdom is located in the northwest region of Kalimdor, also including the island Teldrassil (actually a giant tree, similar in lore and spelling to Yggdrasil) off the northwest coast, which contains the city of Darnassus.\nTo the south, past the Ashenvale Forest, is a stretch of land known as The Barrens, situated between the grasslands of Mulgore to the west, and Durotar, the land settled by the Orcs, to the east.  Mulgore is home to the Tauren capital of Thunder Bluff, a large city of tepees and lodges built on top of a conglomerate of high plateaus which are only accessible by air travel and a great series of lifts built down to the ground. In the north of Durotar is the fortress-city of Orgrimmar, the capital of the Orcs.\nThe third continent, Northrend, is located in the northern polar region of Azeroth and is the primary stronghold of the malevolent Undead Scourge. Northrend is featured in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion set Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, and is the main location featured in  World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, the second expansion pack to World of Warcraft.\nIn the expansion World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, Azeroth has been changed permanently in-game, even for players without the expansion set installed. The corrupted Black Dragon Aspect, Deathwing the Destroyer (formerly Neltharion, the Earth-Warder) has broken free from imprisonment in Deepholm, part of the Elemental Plane, and caused major changes and destruction in the land. In addition, many new parts of the continents of Azeroth that have previously been inaccessible have become key parts in the new world.\nLorewise, this is the second major change to the face of Azeroth, the first being the Sundering. The Sundering was caused as a result of the War of the Ancients where demons of the Burning Legion invaded the ancient Kalimdor. It caused a massive explosion that split the one continent into the four seen in-game and created the Maelstrom.\nWorld of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria was the fourth expansion released and it focuses on the mythical and long-forgotten lands of Pandaria, a continent far to the south that has until now been shrouded in magical mists. It has been inhabited by the Pandarens (a race of humanoid giant pandas). With both factions landing on Pandaria, adventurers rediscover the ancient Pandaren people, whose wisdom will help guide them to new destinies; the Pandaren Empire's ancient enemy, the Mantid; and their legendary oppressors, the enigmatic Mogu. The storyline for Mists of Pandaria is split into multiple chapters. The story arc that introduces Pandaria—where players discover the continent and level up, helping to solve problems and figure out what happened for the past 10,000 years and why—was included entirely within the initial expansion release. Later chapters in the storyline brought the war between the Horde and the Alliance back into focus, including changing parts of Pandaria (via phasing) to show additional settlements, and eventually returning the players back to Kalimdor for a final showdown, dethroning Warchief Garrosh Hellscream.\nWorld of Warcraft: Legion was the sixth expansion released and it focuses on the Broken Isles, a continent and group of islands located northeast of the Maelstrom in the middle of the Great Sea; one of the islands contains the Tomb of the Dark Titan, Sargeras. The Burning Legion has started an invasion of Azeroth and the player characters must find powerful artifacts to stop the invasion. Having thwarted the Burning Legion's attempts to invade Azeroth, the players and other significant lore characters traveled to Argus, the homeworld of the Burning Legion, in order to end its threat. While successful, they couldn't stop Sargeras entirely. Before being banished and imprisoned, he thrust a magical sword into the surface of Azeroth, leaving the planet wounded and bleeding a magical substance called \"Azerite\".\nWorld of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth was the seventh expansion released and it focuses on the islands of Kul Tiras and Zandalar, two islands which are home to their respective kingdoms. This is the first expansion that introduces two new continents on initial release. During this expansion, the Horde and Alliance seek the aid of the kingdoms of Zandalar and Kul Tiras, respectively, for the reignited war between the factions. Throughout campaigns on both continents, adventurers learn the history of both kingdoms and uncover plots involving the Old Gods. Events influenced by N'Zoth and his followers lead to the discovery of the continents of Nazjatar, the underwater kingdom of Azshara, and Mechagon, an island inhabited by the Mechagnomes. The final patch of Battle for Azeroth takes players back to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and Uldum to cure them of the corruption of N'Zoth, and ultimately face the Old God himself in his empire of Ny'alotha. The story of Battle for Azeroth is also the first time players are given choices that can have a significant impact on their own adventures. One significant choice is whether to join the orc Varrok Saurfang in his rebellion against the Horde Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner. Another choice that players are given is whether to become a servant of N'Zoth. Both choices lead to unique dialogue, cinematics, and quests, depending on the choices made.\nThe ninth expansion, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, centers around the reappearance of the Dragon Isles, home of the Dragons and their many aspects, including the humanoid Dracthyr. The various Dragon groups and subspecies are referred to as \"Dragonflights\", and are all descendants of the original proto-dragons who chose to become empowered by the magic of a race of god-like beings called the Titans. The plot of Dragonflight deals with the awakening of the Dracthyr after 20,000 years in response to the threat of Raszageth the Storm-Eater, a \"Primalist\" proto-dragon who seeks to separate the rest of her kind from the Dragonflights and retake Azeroth for themselves. The Dracthyr are divided into two groups, one that allies with the Alliance and one the Horde, to deal with this threat. Raszageth eventually falls to both groups, but not before she releases her three siblings: Fyrakk the Blazing, Vyranoth the Frozenheart, and Iridikron the Stoneheart.\n\nDraenor (Outland)\nDraenor, which is featured in Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, is the original homeland of the Orcs and past home of the Draenei.\nDraenor was torn apart when the Orcish leader, Ner'Zhul (later the first Lich King) opened dozens of portals to other worlds in an attempt to escape the invading Alliance Armies from Azeroth.  The sheer number and combined power of the portals ripped Draenor into fragments and cast the remainder into the mysterious parallel dimension called the Twisting Nether, Home of the Demons. The remnants of the world are now known as Outland, and feature in the last mission of the human campaign of Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal (though, without any actual terrain changes), Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne and more prominently in World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.\nAn intact Draenor is the main feature of the fifth World of Warcraft expansion, Warlords of Draenor, which takes place 35 years earlier in an alternate timeline.\n\nMajor races and factions\nThe following races have been sorted into their respective factions:\n\nThe Alliance\nThe Alliance has been present in some form in all Warcraft games. In all three real-time strategy games, the Alliance are the protagonists of their campaign, and are one of the two main protagonist factions in World of Warcraft. They are also the primary antagonists of Warcraft and the orc campaigns in Warcraft II. The Alliance began in Warcraft II when the human kingdoms and demihumans strategically united to fend off the conquering Horde. Thus they are enemies to the Horde. The Alliance has evolved over the course of the franchise, losing allies and gaining new members, but the Alliance has endured over the years. They are united to uphold their common noble ideals and are bound together by a sense of brotherhood forged by all the battles they've endured together.\nThe major races of the Alliance are the humans of Stormwind, the High Elves, the Night Elves of Teldrassil, and the Dwarves of Ironforge. Other races who have joined or allied with the Alliance include the Gnomes of Gnomeregan, the Draenei of Outland, the Dracthyr Obsidian Warders group (a race of dragonoids), the Worgens of Gilneas (creatures that resemble hunched over werewolves), and the Tushui Pandaren.\nThe Alliance is led by a military commander who coordinates the military actions of all the races in the Alliance. The title for this position depends on the rank of the individual (e.g., Anduin Lothar was a knight and his title was Supreme Allied Commander. Varian Wrynn is a king and his title is High King). This title may require an aspect of diplomacy or has strong political clout as the other leaders can choose not to commit their forces to the commander if they dislike the commander's leadership. Though how much forces and resources are contributed to the war effort is left to each individual leader's discretion, when the military commander issues a call to arms, all races of the Alliance are expected to contribute.\n\nThe Horde\nIn the first two Warcraft games, the Horde is made of the orcs under the command of the Burning Legion and are enemies of the human led Alliance. The orcs attempt in both games to conquer the human kingdoms. Eventually the Horde was defeated, most of its leaders killed, and the orcs placed in internment camps.\nThe third Warcraft game, Reign of Chaos, details the orcs shaking off both the chains of the Alliance, and the corruption of the Burning Legion. The Horde expanded their ranks by forging alliances with the Blood Elves, the Dracthyr Dark Talons group, the Forsaken, the Goblins, the Huojin Pandaren, the Tauren (which resemble Minotaurs), and the Trolls. The Horde later made alliances with the Highmountain Taurens (a subspecies of the Tauren who possess moose-like antlers after one of their own was earlier blessed by the druid patron Cenarius), the Hozen (a race of monkey-like creatures), the Nightborne elves, the Taunka (a subspecies of Tauren that resemble bison-like Minotaurs), and the Vulpera (a nomadic race of fox-like creatures).\n\nBurning Legion\nReception\nIn 1999, Next Generation listed Warcraft and StarCraft as number 32 on their \"Top 50 Games of All Time\", commenting that, \"While Warcraft did not create the realtime strategy genre, it made it appealing to a broad audience. Warcraft II went on to refine the genre. Easy to play, nuanced in design, a pleasure to look at, and often a laugh riot, Warcraft II was nearly perfect.\"\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nOfficial World of Warcraft community site (US)\nOfficial World of Warcraft community site (EU)\nWarcraft on the Warcraft Wiki",

        "streamer": "SCRAPIE",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapie",
        "content": "Scrapie () is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the nervous systems of sheep and goats. It is one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and as such it is thought to be caused by a prion. Scrapie has been known since at least 1732 and does not appear to be transmissible to humans. However, it has been found to be experimentally transmissible to humanised transgenic mice and non-human primates.\nThe name scrapie is derived from one of the clinical signs of the condition, wherein affected animals will compulsively scrape off their fleeces against rocks, trees or fences. The disease apparently causes an itching sensation in the animals. Other clinical signs include excessive lip smacking, altered gaits and convulsive collapse.\nScrapie is infectious and transmissible among conspecifics, so one of the most common ways to contain it (since it is incurable) is to quarantine and kill those affected. However, scrapie tends to persist in flocks and can also arise spontaneously in flocks that have not previously had cases of the disease. The mechanism of transmission between animals and other aspects of the biology of the disease are only poorly understood, and are active areas of research. Recent studies suggest prions may be spread through urine and persist in the environment for decades.\n\nScrapie usually affects sheep around three to five years of age. The potential for transmission at birth and from contact with placental tissues is apparent.\n\nRegulation\nThe disease has been notifiable in the EU since 1993, but unlike bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease), there was no evidence as of 1999 to suggest that scrapie is a risk to human health. In July 2003, a Canadian Food Inspection Agency officer said that while scrapie shows up every year on Canadian farms, \"We've had a lot of experience with scrapie and there's never been a link between scrapie and human illness.\" As of 2004, the USDA made no mention of scrapie in its Sheep and Goats Death Loss circular.\nHistorically, scrapie was considered to be an animal health issue. However, between 1996 and 1999, the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee considered the control and eradication of scrapie in the UK also with public health in mind because of concern over five issues:\n\nMeat and bone meal (MBM), which was suspected to be the source of the BSE in cattle outbreak in the late 1990s, had also been fed to sheep and goats.\nBSE had been transmitted to sheep following experimental oral exposure.\nTransmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) infection was widespread through the carcasses of the sheep, unlike cattle infection which is limited to neural tissues.\nScrapie in sheep was underreported and it might be masking BSE, were it present in sheep.\nSpecified risk material (SRM) measures may not be adequate to control human exposure.\n\nCause\nScrapie and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by prions. Prions were determined to be the infectious agent because transmission is difficult to prevent with heat, radiation and disinfectants, the agent does not evoke any detectable immune response, and it has a long incubation period of between 18 months and 5 years. The agent is thought to be much smaller than the smallest known virus. Prions multiply by causing normally folded proteins of the same type to take on their abnormal shape, which then go on to do the same, in a kind of chain reaction. These abnormal proteins are gradually accumulated in the body, especially in nerve cells, which subsequently die.\n\nTransmission and pathogenesis\nThe primary mode of transmission is from mother to lamb through ingestion of placental or allantoic fluids.\nThe agent can also enter through cuts in the skin. An experiment has shown lambs risk being infected through milk from infected ewes, but the lambs in the experiment also infected each other, making the risk of infection difficult to assess. The experiment did not continue long enough to show if the lambs developed symptoms, but merely that the abnormal prion was present in their bodies.\nThe pathogenesis of scrapie involves the lymphatic system. Once the agent is absorbed through the intestines, misfolded prions first appear and accumulate in the lymph nodes, especially in Peyer's patches at the small intestine. Eventually, the infection invades the brain, often through the spinal cord or the medulla oblongata by creeping up the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, respectively.\n\nClinical signs and diagnosis\nChanges are mild at first; slight behavioral changes and an increase in chewing movements may occur. Ataxia and neurological signs then develop, and affected sheep struggle to keep up with the flock.\nThe signs and effects of scrapie typically appear 2-5 years after infection  but may appear later.  Once the onset of clinical signs has occurred, sheep typically live for 1–6 months. In some cases, they may live longer, but death is an inevitable consequence of the condition. Signs of scrapie vary between infected individual animals and develop slowly. Due to the nerve cell damage caused by the condition, affected animals may exhibit behavioral changes, tremor, pruritus, and locomotor incoordination.\nSome sheep scratch excessively and show patches of wool loss and lesions on the skin. Scratching sheep over the rump area may lead to a nibbling reflex, which is characteristic for the condition.\nSigns of a chronic systemic disease appear later, with weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and death.\nPost mortem examination is important for the diagnosis of scrapie. Histology of tissues shows accumulation of prions in the central nervous system, and immunohistochemical staining and ELISA can also be used to demonstrate the protein.\n\nTreatment and preventive action\nNo treatment is available for affected sheep.\nA test performed by sampling a small amount of lymphatic tissue from the third eyelid is now available.\nIn the UK in 2001, the Blair ministry implemented a National Scrapie Plan, which encouraged breeding from sheep that are genetically more resistant to scrapie. This is intended to eventually reduce the incidence of the disease in the UK sheep population. Scrapie occurs in Europe and North America, but to date, Australia and New Zealand (both major sheep-producing countries) are scrapie-free. In 2003, there was pressure from affected Canadian husbandry practitioners on the Chretien government and their CFIA to implement their own national scrapie plan.\nBreeds such as Cheviot and Suffolk are more susceptible to scrapie than other breeds. Specifically, this is determined by the genes coding for the naturally occurring prion proteins. The most resistant sheep have a double set of ARR alleles, while sheep with the VRQ allele are the most susceptible. A simple blood test reveals the allele of the sheep, and many countries are actively breeding away the VRQ allele.\nOut of fear of BSE-like transmission, many European countries banned some traditional sheep or goat products made without removing the spinal cord, such as smalahove and smokie.\nIn 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called surround optical fiber immunoassay and some specific antibodies against PrPSc.  The technique allowed detection of PrPSc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals' brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. They could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals' lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrPSc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood- or urine-based screening test for scrapie.\nIn the United Kingdom, if a sheep is suspected or found to have scrapie in laboratory tests, it will be euthanised to prevent further suffering and to reduce the possibility of transmission. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will compensate farmers £30 for a cull animal and £90 for any others confirmed to have scrapie, and if scrapie is not confirmed, farmers can claim the \"market value\" of the sheep, up to £400 in compensation.\n\nTransmission/exposure pathways\nVarious studies have indicated prions (PrPSC) which infect sheep and goats with the fatal transmissible encephalopathy known as scrapie are able to persist in soil for years without losing their pathogenic activity. Dissemination of prions into the environment can occur from several sources: mainly, infectious placenta or amniotic fluid of sheep and possibly environmental contamination by saliva or excrement.\nConfirmatory testing for scrapie can only be achieved by applying immunohistochemistry of disease-associated prion protein (PrPSC) to tissues collected post mortem, including obex (a brainstem structure), retropharyngeal lymph node and palatine tonsil. A live animal diagnostic, not confirmatory, test was approved in 2008 for immunochemistry testing on rectal biopsy-derived lymphoid tissue by USDA.\n\nNatural transmission of scrapie in the field seems to occur via the alimentary tract in the majority of cases, and scrapie-free sheep flocks can become infected on pastures where outbreaks of scrapie had been observed before. These findings point to a sustained contagion in the environment, notably in the soil.\nPrion concentration in birth fluids does not alter the infectivity of the prions. Naturally or experimentally infected does and ewes transmit the infection to the lambs, even when placentas have little PrPSC. PrPSC is shed at a higher percentage in sheep placentas (52–72%) than in goat placenta (5–10%) in study trials at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.\nDetectable PrPSC has been reported in the feces of sheep both in the terminal and the early preclinical stages of the disease, suggesting the prions are likely to be shed into the environment throughout the course of the disease. Several sources of prions in feces could be postulated, including environmental ingestion and swallowing infected saliva; however, the most likely source is shedding from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Ruminant animals have specialized Peyer's patches that, throughout the length of the ileum, amount to about 100,000 follicles, and all of these could be infected and shedding prions into the lumen.\nScrapie prions have been found in the Peyer's patches of naturally infected asymptomatic lambs as young as four months of age.\n\nExposure through contaminated vaccines\nContaminated Louping-ill vaccine, known as the 1935 Moredun Louping-ill Vaccine Disaster. More than 1,500 sheep developed scrapie following vaccination. The vaccine was made using formalin-treated sheep brain tissue unknowingly contaminated with scrapie agent. Subsequent investigations showed that intracerebral inoculation of brain and spinal cord tissue from scrapie-infected sheep led to scrapie development in 60% of inoculated sheep, suggesting the presence of a filtrable virus as the probable infective agent.\nContaminated Mycoplasma agalactiae vaccine. Sudden outbreaks in Italy in 1997 and 1998 were attributed to the administration of a contaminated vaccine, as the brain lesions and polymorphism in the affected animals were similar to those exposed to the same vaccine but different from those in unvaccinated sheep with scrapie. Molecular typing revealed the presence of two prion strains in vaccinated animals, suggesting accidental intra- and interspecies transmission due to the vaccine.\n\nExposure through contaminated soil\nIngestion of soil by grazing sheep has been measured in two soil types, at two stocking rates, and over two grazing seasons. Animals ingested up to 400 g soil per kg of body weight between May and November. Rainfall and stocking rate emerged as factors influencing ingestion. The effect of soil type and vegetation type was less evident.\nThe average weight of an adult sheep is around 250 pounds. If an adult sheep ate 400 g/kg of soil as predicted by D. McGrath et al., then the average sheep would ingest about 45,000 g over six months, or 251 g per day. Assuming the soil was contaminated with prions (PrPSC) from feces or birth fluids, then potentially the sheep would become infected. The concentration of the prions in the soil is uncertain, and concentration is not directly proportional to infectivity. Factors affecting prion infectivity in the soil have been shown to include the length of time in the soil and the binding abilities of the soil.\nFor a detailed risk assessment of scrapie-contaminated soil, it was of major importance to analyze whether the detectable PrPSc in the soil extracts still exhibited oral infectivity after incubation times up to 29 months. A bioassay with Syrian hamsters was performed by feeding the animals with contaminated soil or aqueous soil extracts that had been collected after soil incubation for 26 and 29 months, respectively. Hamsters fed with contaminated soil exhibited their first scrapie-associated symptoms at two weeks to six months (95% CI) after the first feeding. The hamsters reached the terminal stage of scrapie at five to 21 months (95% CI) after the first feeding. This indicated substantial amounts of persistent infectivity in soil that had been incubated for 26 and 29 months. In Iceland in 1978, a program was implemented to eradicate scrapie, and affected flocks were culled, premises were disinfected, and sheep houses were burnt; after two to three years, the premises were restocked with lambs from scrapie-free areas. Between 1978 and 2004, scrapie recurred on 33 farms. Nine recurrences occurred 14–21 years after culling as a result of persistent environmental contamination with PrPSc.\nThe binding abilities of different soil types have been shown to enhance disease penetrance into a population. Soil containing the common clay mineral montmorillonite (Mte) and kaolinite (Kte) binds more effectively with the prions than soil containing quartz. Enhanced transmissibility of soil-bound prions may explain the environmental spread of scrapie despite low levels shed into the environment. The mechanism by which Mte or other soil components enhances the transmissibility of particle-bound prions remains to be clarified. Prion binding to Mte or other soil components may partially protect PrPSC from denaturation or proteolysis in the digestive tract, allowing more disease agents to be taken up from the gut. Adsorption of PrPSc soil may alter the aggregation state of the protein, shifting the size distribution toward more infectious prion protein particles, thereby increasing the infectious units. For prion disease to be transmitted via ingestion of prion-contaminated soil, prions must also remain infectious by the oral route of exposure. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin investigated the oral infectivity of Mte-bound and soil-bound prions. The effects of prion source (via infected brain homogenate and purified PrPSc) and dose on penetrance (proportion of animals eventually exhibiting clinical signs of scrapie) and incubation period (time to onset of clinical symptoms) were evaluated. About 38% of animals receiving orally 200 ng of unbound, clarified PrPSc derived from soil exhibited clinical symptoms, with an incubation period for infected animals of 203 to 633 days. All animals orally dosed with an equivalent amount of Mte-bound PrPSc manifested disease symptoms in 195 to 637 days. By contrast, animals orally receiving Mte soil alone or one-tenth as much unbound clarified PrPSc (20 ng) remained asymptomatic throughout the course of the experiment. These data established that Mte-bound prions remain infectious via the oral route of exposure, and that the binding agent Mte increases disease penetrance, enhancing the efficiency of oral transmission.\nExposure through contaminated hay mites\n\"With scrapie, the archetypical TSE, which is a natural disease in sheep and goats, the disease can appear suddenly in a flock in the absence of any known exposure to infected flocks (Palsson, 1979). Finally, fields in Iceland, that were left empty for up to 3 years after the destruction of scrapie-infected flocks, were repopulated with known scrapie-free sheep, and some of the sheep in this latter group subsequently developed scrapie (Palsson, 1979). This last 'experiment in nature' has yielded similar results a number of times in Iceland and the United Kingdom. In one Icelandic farm, flocks have been eradicated three times; each time, the farm was left without sheep for 2 years, and after restocking with sheep from scrapie-free areas, the disease reappeared. Several years ago, a suggestion was made (S Sigurdarson, personal communication) that hay mites would be a good candidate as a vector for scrapie; this led to the infection of mice with mite samples prepared from hay obtained from five Icelandic farms. Ten of these 71 mice became sick after injection with mite preparations from three of the five farms (Wisniewski et al, 1996; Rubenstein et al, 1998). The incubation periods ranged from 340 days to 626 days, and these mice had the protease-resistant form PrpSc, of a host-coded glycoprotein, PrPc . The protease-resistant form is a marker of TSE disease (Prusiner, 1991; Parchi et al, 1996). For some of these clinically positive mice, the banding pattern on WB analysis was unique (Wisniewski et al, 1996; Rubenstein et al, 1998).\"\n\nTransmission summary\nPrions (PrPSc) are shed from sheep and goats in birth fluids, feces, and other excrement. The concentration of the prions is uncertain, but is not directly proportional to infectivity. Sheep ingest a considerable amount of soil, so soil represents a plausible environmental reservoir of scrapie prions, which can persist in the environment for years. Longevity of the prions and the attachment of soil particles likely influences the persistence and infectivity of prions in the environment.\nEffective methods of inactivating prions in the soil are currently lacking, and the effects of natural degradation mechanisms on prion infectivity are largely unknown. An improved understanding of the processes affecting the mobility, persistence and bioavailability of prions in soil is needed for the management of prion-contaminated environments. A system for estimating the prion-binding capacity of soil on farms using simple soil analysis may allow an estimate of the prion risk in the environment, and whether altering prion binding by the use of soil amendments may help to mitigate the infectious prions. Lichens, specifically, Parmelia sulcata, Cladonia rangiferina and Lobaria pulmonaria, may have potential for reducing the number of prions because some lichen species contain proteases that show promise in breaking down the prion. Further work to clone and characterize the proteases, assess their effects on prion infectivity, and determine which component organism or organisms present in lichens produce or influence the protease activity is warranted and is currently under investigation.\n\nGenetics\nThe prion gene that codes for the prion protein is highly conserved in most mammals, meaning the gene is similar and present in most species of mammals. Three locations on the prion protein gene have been identified as highly polymorphic and may have an effect on scrapie: codons 136, 154, and 171. Codon 154 has not shown any evidence of having a high effect on scrapie susceptibility, but is most likely having an effect on incubation time of the disease. Codons 136 and 171 are thought to control the incubation time as well as the susceptibility of the disease, and are the ones the USDA uses in its breeding standard. Codon 171 has been determined to be the major genetic factor in scrapie susceptibility.\n\nSee also\nCreutzfeldt–Jakob disease\nKuru\nTransmissible mink encephalopathy\nVirino\nRams (film), a 2015 Icelandic drama\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nArticle about scrapie and the aforementioned diagnostic test\nUK government scrapie information\nUK government National Scrapie Plan\nScrapie research at the Institute for Animal Health (UK)\nSheep genetics research at the Institute for Animal Health (includes photo of a sheep with scrapie)\nScrapie in the United States\nUS Department of Agriculture video of infected sheep demonstrating Hopping Gait\nStriking a Nerve: Prions Not the Last Word in TSEs – opinion article by Frank Bastian that proposes a different causation for scrapie and other prion diseases",

The term was adopted by gaming communities in many countries because of a large South Korean presence in online gaming communities.\n\nOrigin\nThe term is Sino-Korean vocabulary, and cognates in other East Asian languages that feature the same hanja (高手, literally \"high hand\") include gāoshǒu (Mandarin, \"expert; ace; master\"), and cao thủ (Vietnamese, \"skilled person; master\"). In the dialect of the Gyeongnam province, gosu also has the meaning of \"leader\". Figuratively meaning pro or highly skilled at something, gosu's pre-computing usage usually referred to martial arts or the game of go.\n\nRelated terms\nThough not as popular, there are also several other commonly used Korean words for describing gamers with various skill levels. Jungsu (중수; 中手; lit. middle hand) stands for \"a moderately good player\", hasu (하수; 下手; lit. low hand) for \"a poor player\" or \"a person with no skill\" and chobo (초보; 初步; lit. first step) for \"a novice player\". Hasu and chobo are the same skill level, but hasu is disrespectful or derogatory (whereas chobo is not).

Raised in San Francisco, California, he picked up  Counter-Strike 1.6 from his older brother, Jason. Yip grew up with his brother and sister. His parents were often on business trips in China. Yip described his parents as \"stereotypical Asian parents\" who disapproved of video games, wanting him to take up a \"common\" career such as a lawyer or a doctor. His draw towards video games ultimately created a rift between him and his parents, with Yip recalling his mother believing he was going to be a failure. Her disdain for gaming made Yip feel that his mother had failed him and ultimately drove him out of his own home. At the age of 17, Stewie flew to LA to pursue his own interests in gaming.\nYip stopped playing Counter-Strike 1.6 for a time in favor of other games such as RuneScape, MapleStory, League of Legends and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. He eventually picked up Counter-Strike 1.6 again, but would only play surf maps and mods. Yip began playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in the summer of 2014 after a friend gifted him a copy. He was inspired by videos of Cloud9 and would play many hours of the day. He played matchmaking for 5 months before making the switch to ESEA. During this time, Yip was falsely accused of cheating by several players, further motivating him to pursue a professional CS:GO career.\n\nCareer\nSpontaneously flying to Los Angeles at the age of 17 kicked off the competitive career of a young \"Stewie2K.\" Yip had garnered attention for his competitive PUG performances and heard rumors of a certain player's professional career soon coming to an end opening the door for Yip. He bided his time and waited for said player to relinquish his spot on the team. After Sean Gares announced he was leaving Cloud9, the team decided to pick up Yip with Gares' personal recommendation. Yip joined Cloud9 on January 11, 2016, as an In-Game Leader. He signed the Cloud9 contract a few hours after his 18th birthday. His addition was met with criticism from some veteran players.\nYip played for 2 years with Cloud9 and won several tournaments with the team including ESL Pro League Season 4, DreamHack Open Denver 2017 and iBUYPOWER Masters 2017. Yip won the ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018 with Cloud9 after defeating FaZe clan in double overtime on map 3 of the grand final, the first and only major win for a North American roster. At the end of March, Yip left Cloud9 for SK Gaming. He tried out to replace Epitacio \"TACO\" de Melo's spot on SK Gaming's active lineup. After a three-month period, Made in Brazil (MIBR) signed the SK Gaming roster to play under MIBR's name.\nMIBR traded Yip to Team Liquid for Epitácio \"TACO\" de Melo and head coach Wilton \"zews\" Prado in December 2018.\nIn December 2019, Yip became the first North American CS:GO player to earn over $1,000,000 in tournament prize money after finishing runner up to Astralis in the ECS Season 8 Finals. Yip would go on to win 7 total tournaments with Liquid in 2019. Team Liquid's CS:GO team earned $2.31 million in 2019. After being removed from Team Liquid's active roster in late 2021, Yip signed with Evil Geniuses in January 2022.\nIn July 2022, Yip announced he would be stepping away from competitive Counter-Strike to focus on streaming CS:GO and Valorant for the Evil Geniuses Creator Collective.\nIn May 2024, G2 Esports in-game leader, Rasmus \"HooXi\" Nielsen, was unavailable for IEM Dallas for personal reasons. To replace him, G2 recruited Yip as a stand-in. The event marked Yip's first LAN event in two years. G2 advanced to the final of IEM Dallas, achieving victories over MOUZ, Team Liquid, and FaZe Clan. In the final, G2 defeated Vitality 2-1, securing the championship.\n\nNotable achievements\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHLTV profile",

        "content": "Jacob Rabon IV (born December 19, 1995), better known by his online name Alpharad, is an American YouTuber, Twitch streamer, Esports personality, and musician. He is known for his gaming videos, especially on the Super Smash Bros. series along with his participation in the fighting game community as an announcer/commentator. He is also known for his \"Nuzlocke\" content, a variation on the game Pokémon to make it more difficult. Currently, he focuses on creating variety content, commonly with his friends.\n\nEarly life\nRabon was born on December 19, 1995, in Norman, Oklahoma. He gained an interest in filmmaking around the fifth grade, uploading comedic videos for his friends, one of his first videos being Major O's. Later, he would take video editing and cinematography classes in high school. His original goal was to be an editor of some kind, but pursued being a creator once his channel had begun to take off, dropping out of his community college to do so. Rabon has also admitted that his not becoming an editor was not because of lack of creative freedom, which is a reason he often uses.\n\nCareer\nYouTube\nAlpharad\nRabon created his main YouTube channel on January 13, 2014. Since its creation, he has made various gaming videos on his channel, Alpharad, including the Super Smash Bros. series, Pokémon, Splatoon, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Among Us, as well as other Nintendo titles. He has also dabbled in speedrunning, specifically in a video of him playing through a Super Mario 64 first-person shooter fan game, as well as being a Super Mario Odyssey speedrunner.\nOther videos of his include video game related challenges and streams. In 2021, Rabon collaborated with YouTuber Jaiden Animations on a charity stream for Red Nose Day which involved removing Pokémon from their team after reaching various donation incentives. In 2022, he played Pokémon Go in the Warner Grand theater located in Los Angeles during a Halloween event. Following a series of Nuzlocke challenges as provoked by his friend, fellow YouTuber, and self-proclaimed rival Pokémon Challenges, on April 10, 2023, YouTube Gaming officially dubbed him the \"Nuzlocke King\".\nWhile a majority of his channel has gaming content, Rabon's channel also includes recounts or videos of fun challenges or experiences he has had, such as him talking about his experiences at Universal Studios, Japan, or an edited video of an Awards Show he hosted for his friends.\nIn 2020, Rabon signed with the Creative Artists Agency. Rabon's main YouTube channel has reached over 3 million subscribers as of April 2023.\n\nAlpharad Platinum\nIn 2015, Rabon created his secondary YouTube channel, Alpharad Plus, in which he created generally unedited gaming videos with JoSniffy, which on September 23, 2020, was rebranded to Alpharad Deluxe. At the beginning of 2023, this was once again rebranded to Alpharad Gold, which had the goal of having a video posted everyday of 2023, each featuring a different video game, which he accomplished. After a nine month hiatus from January 1, 2024, the channel has since been rebranded Alpharad Platinum, and posting has resumed as of October 2, 2024.\n\nAlpharad Replay\nOn February 6, 2016, Rabon created a tertiary YouTube channel called \"Alpharad Replay,\" which posts archives of his past YouTube and current Twitch streams.\n\nFriends Without Benefits\nOn June 24, 2016, Rabon co-founded the collaborative YouTube channel Friends Without Benefits. On December 23, 2018, Rabon announced he was leaving the group to focus on his solo projects.\n\nAlpharad Live\nOn September 21, 2020, Rabon created a fourth YouTube channel, Not Alpharad, which posted extremely short videos as well as clips of him or his experiences. Due to clips being replaced by YouTube Shorts which would just be posted onto his main channel, he rebranded it to Alpharad Live, which currently posts highlights of his Twitch streams.\n\nWILD/CARD\nIn 2023, Rabon, alongside Jaiden Animations, created a fourth channel, WILD/CARD, with the purpose of introducing their large collective audience to several of the smaller content creators the two of them considered friends. This collaboration began with Sunflowersmith, Weegee Plays, gsmVoiD, Giwi, Fyrus, Captain Kidd, and has since additionally included Vulpixie since October 2024.\n\nTwitch\nOn the 19th of November, 2014, Rabon created his current Twitch channel, which was originally named \"AlpharadTV\", but has since been renamed to just, \"Alpharad\". Many of Rabon's current YouTube videos were first streamed on Twitch, and edited and scripted into a video.\n\nEsports\nRabon has been involved in esports as a tournament organizer and affiliate with other prominent esports personalities. In January 2020, he participated in a Pokémon VGC tournament hosted by Wolfe Glick with fellow competitive Super Smash Bros. players Ludwig Ahgren, ESAM, and Mew2King amongst other content creators.\nTwo months later, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rabon co-hosted five online tournaments for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate called the \"Quarantine Series\" with fellow YouTuber Cr1TiKaL, which consisted of two events, Minors and Majors, offering $5,000 and $10,000 in prizes, respectively. The major invitationals featured top Super Smash Bros. players such as MkLeo, Samsora, Nairo and Marss, and was streamed on both Cr1TiKaL's Twitch channel and Rabon's YouTube channel.\nIn 2018, Rabon purchased a monthly stake for the esports organization, Panda Global, becoming their content director and a minority shareholder. He had previously expressed his desire to hold more weight in the organization.\nIn 2021, Rabon hosted another tournament in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, dubbed a \"Portal Smash\" tournament, that involved competitive players fighting on recreated stages with added obstacles and hazards. Later in October, Rabon hosted a Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl charity tournament with Panda Global member Coney for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The tournament featured content creators such as Cr1TiKaL, Ludwig Ahgren, Jaiden Animations and Trihex, and ultimately raised over $100,000.\n\nOther ventures\nMusic\nRabon is also a musician, and he formed a band called Ace of Hearts. Their first single was \"Fool for You\", which was released on April 1, 2020. The band's first EP, Monophobia, was released on June 5, 2020. This was then followed by another single, \"Silver Lining\", which was released nearly a month later on July 1, 2020. The band's second EP, Scorpion Queen, was released on December 13, 2020. The band's single \"Lights Off\" was released on March 31, 2021. Ace of Hearts' most recent single, \"Deadbeat Boulevard\", released on November 11, 2021. Their newest album, \"Frozen in Time\", was released on December 10, 2021.\n\nTheatre\nCopypasta Theatre\nOn June 27, 2021, Rabon announced a one-time pop-up show to be held the very same day, named the Copypasta Theatre. He and thirteen other creators dramatically read copypastas to a live audience at the Black Box theatre in Los Angeles. Stage guests included Daniel Thrasher, Adriana Figueroa, Drumsy, Mari Norwood, Jules Conroy, Phil Visu, Cristina Vee Valenzuela, Ross O'Donovan, Dan Fulling, cjya, Johnny Rico (who impersonated Bruno Mars), and Rabon's project manager Deanna Gowland. The viral video of the performance involved a segment where several of gaming streamer Ninja's Twitter posts were read aloud; Ninja later shared the video on his Twitter page.\n\nRomeo and Juliet\nOn September 12, 2021, Rabon announced a rendition of the play Romeo and Juliet, which was held on the same day. He performed with thirteen other creators, including Jaiden Animations, cjya, Adrisaurus, and many more. In this performance, the actors had no rehearsals and instead performed on cue-cards which outlined the general actions of the characters in each scene.\n\nCup-Pong\nOn April 13, 2022, Rabon announced a Cup-Pong tournament in order to raise money for Extra Life, to be held on July 1 of that year. This involved thirty-two others which were split into sixteen teams, with thirty-one being creators (including Ovilee May, Altrive, Ted Nivison), plus Rabon's father, under the nickname \"Alphadad\". This event ended up raising $30,253.19 USD for the charity, with Ted Nivison and Ethan Nestor being the winners.\n\nPersonal life\nDuring an episode of Rabon and Coney's podcast, How Did We Get Here?, Rabon opened up about his experience being diagnosed with ADHD. In the same podcast, he also revealed that he is somewhere in the asexual and aromantic spectrum. Rabon has also confirmed he is bisexual.\nRabon and fellow YouTuber Jaiden Dittfach purchased a house together in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles in 2022. At the end of February 2024, Rabon and Dittfach moved to a different home together.\n\nSee also\nSuper Smash Bros. in esports\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nAlpharad's channel on YouTube\nAlpharad on Twitch\nAlpharad at IMDb\nAce Of Hearts (Spotify)\nWILD/CARD on YouTube",

        "content": "The volcanic explosivity index (VEI) is a scale used to measure the size of explosive volcanic eruptions. It was devised by Christopher G. Newhall of the United States Geological Survey and Stephen Self in 1982.\nVolume of products, eruption cloud height, and qualitative observations (using terms ranging from \"gentle\" to \"mega-colossal\") are used to determine the explosivity value. The scale is open-ended with the largest eruptions in history given a magnitude of 8. A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions, defined as less than 10,000 m3 (350,000 cu ft) of tephra ejected; and 8 representing a supervolcanic eruption that can eject 1.0×1012 m3 (240 cubic miles) of tephra and have a cloud column height of over 20 km (66,000 ft). The scale is logarithmic, with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold increase in observed ejecta criteria, with the exception of between VEI-0, VEI-1 and VEI-2.\n\nClassification\nWith indices running from 0 to 8, the VEI associated with an eruption is dependent on how much volcanic material is thrown out, to what height, and how long the eruption lasts. The scale is logarithmic from VEI-2 and up; an increase of 1 index indicates an eruption that is 10 times as powerful. As such, there is a discontinuity in the definition of the VEI between indices 1 and 2. The lower border of the volume of ejecta jumps by a factor of one hundred, from 10,000 to 1,000,000 m3 (350,000 to 35,310,000 cu ft), while the factor is ten between all higher indices. In the following table, the frequency of each VEI indicates the approximate frequency of new eruptions of that VEI or higher.\n\nAbout 40 eruptions of VEI-8 magnitude within the last 132 million years (Mya) have been identified, of which 30 occurred in the past 36 million years. Considering the estimated frequency is on the order of once in 50,000 years, there are likely many such eruptions in the last 132 Mya that are not yet known. Based on incomplete statistics, other authors assume that at least 60 VEI-8 eruptions have been identified. The most recent is Lake Taupō's Oruanui eruption, more than 27,000 years ago, which means that there have not been any Holocene eruptions with a VEI of 8.\nThere have been at least 10 eruptions of VEI-7 in the last 11,700 years. There are also 58 Plinian eruptions, and 13 caldera-forming eruptions, of large, but unknown magnitudes. By 2010, the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution had cataloged the assignment of a VEI for 7,742 volcanic eruptions that occurred during the Holocene (the last 11,700 years) which account for about 75% of the total known eruptions during the Holocene. Of these 7,742 eruptions, about 49% have a VEI of 2 or lower, and 90% have a VEI of 3 or lower.\n\nLimitations\nUnder the VEI, ash, lava, lava bombs, and ignimbrite are all treated alike. Density and vesicularity (gas bubbling) of the volcanic products in question is not taken into account. In contrast, the DRE (dense-rock equivalent) is sometimes calculated to give the actual amount of magma erupted. Another weakness of the VEI is that it does not take into account the power output of an eruption, which makes the VEI extremely difficult to determine with prehistoric or unobserved eruptions.\nAlthough VEI is quite suitable for classifying the explosive magnitude of eruptions, the index is not as significant as sulfur dioxide emissions in quantifying their atmospheric and climatic impact.\n\nLists of notable eruptions\nTimeline of volcanism on Earth (mostly VEI-6, within 2 kya)\nList of volcanic eruptions 1500–2000\nList of volcanic eruptions in the 21st century\nList of volcanic eruptions by death toll\nList of large Holocene volcanic eruptions (VEI-5–7)\nList of large volcanic eruptions (VEI-5–8, within 450+ Mya)\nList of largest volcanic eruptions (VEI-7–8, mostly within 500 Mya)\n\nSee also\nSupervolcano – Volcano that has had an eruption with a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 8\nDecade Volcanoes – Set of sixteen volcanoes noted for their eruptive history and proximity to densely populated areas\nDispersal index – Indicator of spread of volcanic ejecta\nLists of volcanoes\nList of natural disasters by death toll\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nVEI glossary entry from a USGS website\nHow to measure the size of a volcanic eruption, from The Guardian\nThe size and frequency of the largest explosive eruptions on Earth, a 2004 article from the Bulletin of Volcanology\nList of Large Holocene Eruptions (VEI > 4) from the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program Archived 2012-01-17 at the Wayback Machine",

        "content": "Brian Limond (born 20 October 1974), known as Limmy, is a Scottish comedian, author, and Twitch streamer.\nWhile working as a website designer and Flash developer, Limmy began releasing comedy on his website and blog, Limmy.com, which contained various Flash-based projects. In late 2006, he released a daily podcast called Limmy's World of Glasgow, which received interest from the mainstream British media.\nAfter continuing his comedy work for several years, Limmy was commissioned by BBC Scotland to create a sketch show, Limmy's Show. It ran for three series and a Christmas special between 2010 and 2013, and won two BAFTA Scotland awards. Limmy returned to BBC Scotland with another sketch comedy show, Limmy's Homemade Show, with a one-off episode in 2018 and a full series in 2020. Limmy has also engaged in various other pursuits, such as writing several books and performing live shows. He is a prolific user of online media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Twitch and formerly Vine.\n\nEarly life\nBrian Limond was born on 20 October 1974 to Jessie and Billy Limond in Glasgow, and grew up in the Carnwadric area of the city. He studied multimedia technology at Glasgow Caledonian University, graduating in 1996. He found success as a website designer and Flash developer after starting work at Glasgow-based new media company Black ID. In the summer of 2000, employees of Black ID created a rival company called Flammable Jam, where Limmy was a director. During his time there, he was asked to contribute to the book New Masters of Flash: The 2002 Annual, a resource for Macromedia Flash developers. In 2001, he co-founded the company Chunk Ideas, selling his stake in the company to co-founder Donnie Kerrigan in 2006, so he could concentrate on his comedy career.\n\nCareer\nScottish culture magazine The List listed Limmy at No. 14 on their \"Hot 100\" list in 2006, which celebrated the people who made the biggest impact on cultural life in Scotland over that year. In March 2007, Limmy took to the stage for two sold-out appearances at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival. In 2007, he played a character called Zack Eastwood in Consolevania and VideoGaiden. In June 2009, the BBC commissioned a six-episode series of Limmy's Show, a sketch show which premiered on BBC Scotland in January 2010. The BBC commissioned a second series of Limmy's Show, which premiered on BBC Scotland in February 2011. Limmy wrote a pilot for a sitcom based around Falconhoof, a recurring Limmy's Show character, but the show was turned down by BBC Scotland. He made a cameo appearance in The IT Crowd, playing a window cleaner with an unintelligible Glaswegian accent in the episode \"The Final Countdown\", which aired in July 2010.\nIn 2014, Limmy had a regular segment in the second series of the Charlie Brooker news satire show Weekly Wipe. He is also known for his live webcam chats, in which he interacts with fans and makes music. In 2015, Limmy wrote his first book titled Daft Wee Stories, published by Random House. To promote the book, Limmy embarked on a UK book reading tour. Three of the stories were also published in The Scotsman newspaper.\nIn January 2016, Limmy performed four nights at the Clyde Auditorium and one night at the Hammersmith Apollo, adapting material from this TV shows to become Limmy Live! On 1 May 2017, he released his second book of short stories, That's Your Lot, embarking on a similar UK book reading tour to his first.\nLimmy appeared on Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast in 2015, 2017, and 2020. He also appeared on The Blindboy Podcast in 2020.\nLimmy has been noted for the parody tributes he often tweets on the announcement of a celebrity's death; he invariably posts that he \"had the pleasure of meeting [them] at a charity do once. [They were] surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny\". Following the death of nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, his tweet was mistakenly reported as a genuine tribute by Sky News.\nIn 2017, the BBC commissioned what was then a one-off special of Limmy's Homemade Show, which was broadcast in April 2018. Originally intended to be a web series before being picked up by the BBC, the show is produced, performed, directed, filmed, and edited by Limmy alone, and takes place in or around his home. A follow-up series was commissioned by the BBC and began airing in April 2020. After the airing of his one-off commentary Limmy's Other Stuff in October 2020, Limmy announced his retirement from television, citing his mental health, as doing TV work made him \"fucking suicidal\". Since 2018, Limmy has been livestreaming almost daily on the website Twitch, where he plays video games, chats to fans and tells improvised comedy stories.\n\nPersonal life\nLimmy has struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts and alcoholism, and has discussed this on social media and in interviews. He gave up drinking alcohol in 2004. Limmy was in a relationship with Lynn McGowan from 2000; in January 2022, she announced they had separated. They have one son. Limmy is an atheist and supports Scottish independence.\n\nFilmography\nBibliography\nDaft Wee Stories (2015) ISBN 978-1780893754\nThat's Your Lot (2017) ISBN 978-0008172602\nSurprisingly Down to Earth, and Very Funny (2019) ISBN 978-0008294663\n\nAwards\n2011 British Academy Scotland Award (Limmy's Show)\n2013 British Academy Scotland Award for Best Comedy/Entertainment Programme (Limmy's Show)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLimmy on Twitch\nLimmy on Twitter \nLimmy at British Comedy Guide\nLimmy author page at Penguin Books",

The game includes various modes, such as single-player and multiplayer competitions.\nLaunched in 2013 by Anton Wallén, the game maintained a relatively small but active player base until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic and social media led to a significant influx of new players. In 2024, the game moved to a subscription model.\nThe game has been described as an educational tool for geography, allowing players to learn and identify various global geographical and cultural characteristics. These include writing systems, architecture, left- and right-hand traffic, flags, vehicle registration plates, landscapes, and flora. This educational aspect enhances players' understanding of different cultures and regions around the world.\n\nGameplay\nModes\nThe \"classic\" GeoGuessr game mode consists of five rounds, each displaying a different street view location for the player to guess on a map. The player then receives a score of up to 5,000 points depending on how accurate their guess was, up to 25,000 points for a perfect game. Games may be user-generated or randomly generated from a pool of locations.\nAlternative game modes include:\n\nBattle Royale, a multiplayer last man standing game.\nDuels, a two-player head-to-head competition.\nStreaks, where players identify countries or U.S. states until they guess incorrectly.\nExplorer Mode, a single-player game where medals are awarded for accuracy in individual countries\nTeam Duels, a variation of Duels played between two teams.\nMaprunner, single-player game mode featuring a board game style interface.\nSingleplayer, where players travel the world and its various cities while collecting tips to help them determine where they are.\nIn 2022, GeoGuessr acquired the geography quiz site Seterra, and implemented a quiz mode combining standard street view gameplay with trivia questions.\n\nInterface\nThe game's HUD primarily features the Google Street View imagery, as well as a compass. Users can control the movement, panning, and zooming of the image, although GeoGuessr allows any of these features to be disabled for harder gameplay. An inset map, using Google Maps's standard overlay, allows players to place a pin to make their guess.\n\nStrategy\nUsers may interpret their location from the photographs by reading road signage, memorizing utility poles, finding the relative position of the Sun, identifying flora and soil types, and learning diacritics specific to particular writing systems. Players can also make use of Street View metadata to ascertain their location – for example, the Street View vehicle that captured imagery in Kruger National Park was unique in that it was green and had white roof racks.\n\nDistribution\nGeoGuessr requires a paid subscription to play. A free mode, which restricted users to 5 minutes of game play every 15 minutes, was discontinued on 1 February 2024, although challenges and quizzes are still free to play. Free-to-play users are still able to join and play in private parties hosted by a user with a subscription.\n\nDevelopment\nThe game was designed by Swedish IT consultant Anton Wallén in 2013. Wallen loved to visit faraway locations on Google Street View, and initially designed a program to generate a random location in Street View before deciding to add a competitive element.\nThe game's development took approximately two weeks' work, and uses the Backbone.js JavaScript library and the Google Maps API for games using Google Street View. Wallén posted the completed game to Google Chrome Experiments on 10 May 2013.\nAs well as English, the game is available in ten other languages: Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Polish and Japanese. Mobile apps for GeoGuessr are available on the Android and iOS platforms.\n\nReception\nThe launch of the game in May 2013 was described as successful, with the game instantly going viral. Upon its release, the game was described as \"insanely addictive.\" The start of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a renewed interest in the game and it also had a second peak in March 2021. By July 2022, the game had 40 million player accounts. Interest in the game has been propagated on platforms such as Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch, where notable users such as Ludwig, GeoWizard, and Rainbolt have recorded or streamed themselves playing the game.\nThe game has been cited as an educational tool by helping users to \"develop critical skills to analyze geographical and cultural landscapes\", and it has been suggested that the game could enhance geographical education within the classroom.\nGeoGuessr users have criticized some of the photographic coverage used in the game. Locations such as Zanzibar used third-party and unofficial imagery, and GeoGuessr players have described some of this media as grainy, blurry, and over- or under-exposed. World Travel in 360, the organization that led the program to supply coverage of Zanzibar, stated that \"[their] mapping is better than nothing\".\nThe game has been the inspiration for several fan-made versions which use video game environments, such as the worlds of Grand Theft Auto V, Fortnite, World of Warcraft, Genshin Impact, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nAI research\nIn July 2023, researchers at Stanford University developed a machine learning tool that was able to locate 40 percent of GeoGuessr locations with an accuracy of 25 kilometres (16 mi) or better. After three attempts, the model was able to beat Trevor Rainbolt, a top-ranked player. In a preprint, the authors noted that such models could positively impact climate research, as successful geolocation of an image often requires a correct climate classification of the locale: if artificial intelligence can detect that two images come from the same region, feeding the tool with pictures could provide inexpensive data on how climate change affects regions. The study stated that quick recognition of outdoor locations could have privacy and security implications.\n\nEvents\nOn 2 October 2022 GeoGuessr co-sponsored Ligue Intercommu's \"GeoGuessr Team World Cup\", a LAN party streamed on Twitch. It was commentated by streamers including Antoine Daniel and Etoiles. The competition was won by the team \"Speed Plonkers\", which featured the players Blinky (France), Kodiak (Germany), and Maccem (Sweden).\nTwo GeoGuessr World Cup tournaments have been held. In October 2023, Dutch player Consus beat French player Blinky in the final. The second World Cup was held in September 2024, with Blinky winning 3–2 over American player MK.\n\nSee also\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the video game industry\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Kitbuqa Noyan (died 1260), also spelled Kitbogha, Kitboga, or Ketbugha, was an Eastern Christian of the Naimans, a group that was subservient to the Mongol Empire. He was a lieutenant and confidant of the Mongol Ilkhan Hulagu, assisting him in his conquests in the Middle East including the sack of Baghdad in 1258. When Hulagu took the bulk of his forces back with him to attend a ceremony in Mongolia, Kitbuqa was left in control of Syria, and was responsible for further Mongol raids southwards towards the Mamluk Sultanate based in Cairo. He was killed in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut, which was the first major loss of the Mongolian advances and halted their expansion into Arabia and Europe.\n\nBiography\nIn 1252, Möngke Khan ordered Kitbuqa to lead the advance guard of Hulagu Khan's army against the fortresses of the Nizari Ismailis. He advanced with Hulagu into western Persia, mounting a series of sieges, and commanded one of the flanks that sacked Baghdad in 1258 before assisting in the conquest of Damascus in 1260.\nHistorical accounts, quoting from the writings of the medieval historian Templar of Tyre, would often describe the three Christian rulers (Hethum I of Armenia, Bohemond VI of Antioch, and Kitbuqa) entering the city of Damascus together in triumph, though modern historians have characterized this story as apocryphal.\nWhen Hulagu Khan withdrew his forces, responding to internal events in the Mongol Empire (the death of Hulagu's brother, the Great Möngke Khan), Kitbuqa was left in charge of the Mongol army remaining in the Middle East:\n\nKitbuqa, who had been left by Hulagu in Syria and Palestine, held the Land in peace and in state of rest. And he greatly loved and honoured the Christians because he was of the lineage of the Three Kings of Orient who came to Bethlehem to adore the nativity of Our Lord. Kitbuqa worked at recovering the Holy Land.\n\nBattle of Ain Jalut\nIn command of a force estimated to be between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, Kitbuqa attempted to continue the Mongol advance towards Egypt. However, the Mamluks had negotiated a passive truce with the Crusaders, allowing the Mamluks to advance northwards through Crusader territory, and camp for resupply near the Crusader stronghold of Acre. In this way, the Mamluks were able to engage the depleted Mongol army near Galilee, at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut (spring of Goliath). The Mongols were defeated, and Kitbuqa was captured. When he was brought, bound, before the Mamluk sultan he was defiant, describing the Mongol vengeance that would befall the victors. He taunted the Mamluk emirs, saying how he had always been loyal to his master, whilst they had betrayed theirs. Kitbuqa was executed by veteran Mamluk Jamal al-Din Akoush al-Shamsy.\nMamluk histories speak of Kitbuqa with respect, painting him as a great warrior who refused to retreat when the Mongols were clearly being overpowered at Ain Jalut, and who favored death in battle over retreat and shame. It was expected that Kitbuqa's death would be avenged by Hulagu, but an internal conflict between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Mongol Golden Horde prevented this from happening. Kitbuqa's death and the defeat of the Mongols at Ain Jalut marked the beginning of the end for the Westward expansion of the Mongol Empire.  It was the first occasion they had been decisively defeated and failed to avenge such a loss, though the Mongols continued to invade Syria, Japan, Hungary, Poland and Southeast Asia for the next several decades.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nRunciman, Steven (1987).

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwashing_liquid",
        "content": "Dishwashing liquid (washing-up liquid in British English), also known as dishwashing soap, dish detergent, or dish soap, is a detergent used in dishwashing. Dishwashing detergent for dishwashers comes in various forms such as cartridges, gels, liquids, packs, powder, and tablets. It is usually a highly-foamy mixture of surfactants with low skin irritation that consumers primarily use for washing glasses, plates, cutlery, and cooking utensils. In addition to its primary use, dishwashing liquid is also used for various informal applications, like creating bubbles, clothes washing, and cleaning off wildlife affected by oil spills.\nDishwashing liquid has existed for a long time with different compositions and conditions for use. Currently, most dishwashing liquid functions best with hot water. However, there are some special dishwashing liquids designed to work well with cold water or seawater.\n\nHistory\nBefore the invention of detergents in Germany during World War I, consumers used washing soda (sodium carbonate) for dishwashing. The manufacture of liquid detergent for dishwashing began in the middle of the 20th century. Dishwashing detergent production started in the United States in the 1930s–1940s. Teepol, the first dishwashing detergent in Europe, commenced production in 1942.\nIn 2005, dishwashing detergent retail sales totaled nearly US$10 billion worldwide.\n\nComposition and Safety\nDishwashing liquid may contain bleach, enzymes, and rinsing aids. The main ingredient is water; the main active ingredients are detergents. Dishwashing liquid has detergent rather than soap because the soaps would react with any minerals in the water to form soap scum. There are other thickening and stabilizing agents in the dishwashing liquid as well.\nHand dishwashing detergents utilize surfactants to play the primary role in cleaning. The reduced surface tension of water and increased solubility of modern surfactant mixtures allow water to run off dishes very quickly. Additionally, surfactants remove grease and food particles to aid in cleaning dishes. They may also provide foam.\nOther ingredients may include hydrotropes, salts, preservatives, fragrances, antibacterial ingredients, and dyes. Preservatives prevent microorganisms' proliferation within the liquid. Antibacterial ingredients make it difficult for bacteria to survive on surfaces.\nSome alternatives for dishwashing detergents may be homemade, using ingredients such as borax, essential oil, eucalyptus oil, leftover cooking oil, and bar soap, among others.\nItems that can be damaged by certain dishwashing liquids (especially with the use of hot water or when put into a dishwasher) include household silver, fine glassware, gold-leafed objects, disposable plastics, as well as objects made of brass, bronze, cast iron, pewter, tin, or wood. Dishwashing liquid components are also harder to rinse off from rough surfaces than smooth surfaces, increasing the chance of accidental ingestion.\nIn 2010, the United States FDA raised health concerns over triclosan, an antibacterial substance used in some dish liquids. Elsewhere, triclosan has been found to create problems at wastewater treatment plants, whereby it can \"sabotage some sludge-processing microbes and promote drug resistance in others.\" As of 2014, at least one US state has banned triclosan in dishwashing liquids.\nSome dishwashing products contain phosphates. Phosphates make dishes cleaner but can also cause harmful algal bloom as the wastewater goes back to the natural environment. Because of this, many places have banned this component. Phosphates can also cause harmful health effects upon skin contact.\nMany dishwashing liquids contain perfume which can cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. It can also cause hand eczema. Those with sensitive skin could use hypoallergenic gloves to avoid direct contact with the liquids. Recent research has found that Blackcurrant seeds are helpful for lessening the effects of allergies, due to its hydrophobicity. Surfactants that are anionic also showed promising results in preventing skin irritation.\nAccidental ingestion of rinse aids (components within dishwashing tablets) can lead to vomiting.\n\nSurfactant design\nThere has been comparisons of different surfactants that reduce the surface tension of water to determine the most efficient dishwashing liquid. Lowering of surface tension helps with the cleaning processes. A study showed that anionic surfactant combined with non-ionic surfactant worked better than anionic and amphoteric surfactants combined. Another study found that cationic and anionic surfactants combined worked better than non-ionic and anionic surfactants combined. Anionic and amphoteric surfactants combined are the least effective out of the three.\n\nPrimary uses\nDishwashing liquid is primarily for removing food from dirty dishes and tableware. Consumers usually scrape heavy soil (large food particles) from the dishes before using dishwashing liquid.\n\nHand dishwashing\nConsumers handwash dishes in the absence of a dishwashing machine and when large \"hard-to-clean\" items are present, or through preference.\n\nAutomatic dishwashing\nAutomatic dishwashing is when consumers use a dishwashing machine or other apparatus. It is generally for convenience, sanitation, or personal preference. The cleaning is less reliant on the detergent's surfactants and more so on the machine's hot water as well as the detergent's builders, bleach, and enzymes. Automatic dishwashing detergents' surfactants generally have less foam to avoid disrupting the machine.\n\nInformal uses\nReader's Digest notes it may be used to kill ants and weeds, help spread water-borne fertilizer, and wash human hair.Good Housekeeping says it can be mixed with vinegar to attract and drown fruit flies. Dishwashing detergent can clean mirrors as well as windows.\nTwibright Labs published Pling, an open-source general-purpose cleaner for glazed, plastic, chrome, and stainless steel bathroom and kitchen surfaces. It uses dishwashing liquid as one of the active ingredients.\nDishwashing liquid with water and additional ingredients such as glycerin and sugar produces a bubble-blowing solution.\nDishwashing liquid can clean delicate clothing fabrics such as hosiery and lingerie.\nDishwashing liquid in a dilute solution can make decals and vinyl graphics easier to position when applying.\nIn industry, some use dishwashing liquid for inspecting equipment under pressure for leaks, such as propane fittings. They can also use dishwashing liquid for inspecting pneumatic tires for flats, as well as for quality assurance during the installation process, and as a mounting bead lubricant.\nDishwashing liquid can act as an ingredient in making homemade garden pest deterrents. Oregon State University's Cooperative Extension Service notes the use of dishwashing liquid to get rid of spider mites. Dish soap can also deter aphids. In some instances, the dish soap may be toxic to plant leaves and cause them to \"burn\". The University of Georgia noted the use of soap or dish detergent to help spread pesticide on plants, however, the institution did not recommend this method.\nA solution of dishwashing liquid and water can remove coffee, tea, olive oil, soda and fruit juice stains from fabrics. One dishwashing liquid brand can remove stains from white or lightly colored cloth napkins.\nDishwashing liquid can treat birds in oil spills.\n\nMarket share\nCurrently, market research companies like Euromonitor and Grand View Research collect data on different brands' market share.\nGrand View Research gives the general global market trend. For example, for 2021, the company reported dishwashing detergent market share to be at 17.98 billion US dollars worldwide.\nEuromonitor International collects market trends of many big brands like Procter and Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever, Ajax.\nFor example, according to Euromonitor International in 2013, Reckitt Benckiser held the highest retail value share percentages in nine countries: Italy (31%), Spain (29%); with Finish brand: Australia (38%), New Zealand (38%), Austria (32%), Ireland (29%), and Israel (27%); Denmark (30%) with Neophos brand; and Portugal (22%) with Calgonit brand.\n\nSee also\nDishwasher detergent\nCleaning agent\nList of cleaning agents\nList of cleaning products\nSoap\nGreen cleaning\nWashing\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\"Liquid Dish Soap\".

        "content": "Eric Hansen (born May 24, 1992) is a Canadian chess grandmaster and Twitch streamer. FIDE awarded him the grandmaster title in 2013. He competed in the FIDE World Cup in 2011 and 2013. Hansen has represented Canada in the Chess Olympiad.\n\nBiography\nHansen holds a dual citizenship as a Canadian and American. Hansen was born in Irvine, California but grew up in Calgary, Alberta. He first attended elementary school at Webber Academy where his chess roots formed a solid foundation during school chess club.\nIn a March 2016 interview with La Presse, Hansen said he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when he was 8 or 9 years old. In a 2015 article by sportsnet, Hansen said he was prescribed Ritalin temporarily and enrolled in a school for children with learning disabilities.\nHansen attended the University of Texas at Dallas for one year, beginning in September 2011, on a chess scholarship, representing the school in intercollegiate tournaments. He took a break from his studies to focus on chess full-time, and made his European base in Valencia, Spain, in autumn 2013.\n\nChess career\nEric began playing chess in grade school at age nine. By 15, he became the youngest ever Alberta champion and earned the title FIDE Master (FM). He became Alberta champion again in 2009, 2011, and 2013.\nIn 2011, Hansen tied for first place in the Canadian Closed Championship with a score of 7½/9 points, but lost a two-game playoff to Bator Sambuev, who was declared champion. Nevertheless, Hansen was nominated to play in the FIDE World Cup 2011. In that event, Hansen played Vugar Gashimov, losing both games. In a 4 September 2012 video interview at the Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, Hansen reflected on his 2011 World Cup experience: \"I got paired against Gashimov and he killed me. It was a good experience because I realized I wasn't serious enough to be competing with these guys. I'm more serious now ... it was good for motivating me.\"\nHansen won the Canadian Open Chess Championship in Victoria, British Columbia, in July 2012. The next month, he tied for fifth place in the World Junior Chess Championship in Athens, Greece, scoring 9/13 points, the best-ever finish by a Canadian in this event; the previous best had been Vinny Puri's tie for 8th place in 1988. At the Isthmia Open tournament at Vrachati a few days later, Hansen scored his first Grandmaster norm with a tie for 1st–3rd place.\nHansen achieved his final Grandmaster norm in the 40th Chess Olympiad, in Istanbul, Turkey, in August–September 2012, where he made his debut on the Canadian national team. He played on board four and scored 7½/10 points, boosting his FIDE rating by 25 points, reaching 2500 (the minimum for the GM title). Hansen is the second-youngest Canadian to attain the title of Grandmaster, after Mark Bluvshtein, who did so at age 16 in 2004, and the youngest homegrown Canadian (because Bluvshtein received Israeli youth chess training systems before immigrating to Canada in 1999 at age 11). FIDE awarded him the title in January 2013.\nHansen tied for first place at the October 2012 American Continental Championship in Mar del Plata, Argentina, with Julio Granda Zuñiga, Alexander Shabalov, Diego Flores, and Gregory Kaidanov. Since there were four qualifying places for the 2013 World Cup, Hansen played a rapidplay playoff with the other four, finishing fourth. In December, he won the 2nd Panama Open, scoring 8½/9.\nIn early 2013, Hansen tied for first place at the Cappelle-la-Grande Open in France. In July he shared first place in the Canadian Open in Ottawa with Nigel Short, with both scoring 7½/9.\nIn the 2015 Canadian Zonal Championship, Hansen shared first place with Leonid Gerzhoy and Tomas Krnan, who was declared the winner on tiebreak.\nIn the online tournament Airthings Masters in February 2022, Hansen defeated both Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi in the preliminary rounds and qualified for the knockout phase.\n\nOnline chess and streaming\nHansen is predominantly a blitz and bullet player, both over-the-board and online. He has played at Internet Chess Club (ICC), Chess.com, ChessCube, PlayChess.com, and lichess.org. For most of 2011, Hansen was recognized as the highest-rated player on ChessCube.com, with a 3000+ rating. By April 2012, he was recognized as the highest-rated bullet player on Chess.com. He subsequently qualified for and accepted Chess.com's Death-Match 4 against then-IM Conrad Holt, who had the highest blitz rating. The two were living in the same dorm on the University of Texas at Dallas campus at the time. Holt won the match 15-11.\nHansen is the main host of the \"Chessbrah\" chess channel on Twitch along with GM Aman Hambleton. The channel occasionally features other \"brahs\", most of whom are titled players, such as GM Magnus Carlsen, GM Yasser Seirawan, GM Robin van Kampen, GM Aryan Tari, FM Lefong Hua, Elias Oussedik, Omid Malek, and Eric Kurtz. Stream highlights are often later posted on a YouTube account with the same name as the Twitch channel. As of September 2024, each channel has about 330,000 followers/subscribers.\nIn April 2021, the Chessbrah YouTube channel received copyright strikes from a multi-channel network acting on behalf of fellow Grandmaster and streamer Hikaru Nakamura, leading Hansen to criticise Nakamura for the strikes and for his past behaviour in the broader chess community. Nakamura publicly apologized and retracted the copyright strikes, indicating he would take a more active role in the management of his content and business.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nEric Hansen rating card at FIDE \nEric Hansen rating and tournament record at Chess Federation of Canada\nEric Hansen Chess Olympiad record at OlimpBase.org \nEric Hansen chess games at 365Chess.com \nEric Hansen player profile at Chess.com\nEric Hansen on Twitter",

        "content": "Morgpie (born June 1999 or 2000) is a Twitch streamer, OnlyFans model, and pornographic film actress. A content creator, she is best known for her popularization of sexually suggestive niche genres on Twitch, referred to as metas by the platform's community.\nIn 2023 and 2024, her \"topless\" and green-screen metas featured implied nudity and the use of body parts as a green-screen, respectively. These genres caught on as trends, sparking similar suggestive content to gain popularity on the platform. Her streams proved to be provocative, polarizing users with some arguing her content was skirting the line regarding Twitch's content policies, while others pointed out a perceived double standard between male and female streamers. The community furor raised on the platform around the metas she spawned led to her temporary ban and multiple modifications to Twitch's guidelines.\n\nCareer\nA content creator from Texas, Morgpie is a model and streamer on OnlyFans and Twitch, respectively. Additionally, she is a cosplayer. She is also a pornographic film actress, entering the industry as an amateur in 2019, and having won two Pornhub Awards: one for \"Top Squirting Performer\" in 2023, and another for \"Favorite Fitness Model\" in 2024.\n\nTwitch content metas\nIn late 2023 and early 2024, Morgpie garnered attention after pushing the boundaries of the Twitch platform's guidelines. She fledged risqué and niche content genres on the service, colloquially referred to as a meta. On December 8, 2023, Morgpie went viral for her \"topless\" meta, in which she streamed gameplay while appearing to be nude. Though wearing a tube top and jeans, her streams carried an implied nudity due to the framing of her camera, showing her bare shoulders, upper chest, and cleavage but cut off just above her nipples. Not explicitly violating platform rules, her content was technically within Twitch's guidelines on adult female nudity at the time, which prohibited streamers from showing \"female-presenting breasts with exposed nipples\", with an exception for breastfeeding. She credited fellow streamer AsianBunny for the meta, citing her as an influence to incorporate it into her own streams.\n\nSome users felt Morgpie was pushing the platform's boundaries too far, toeing the line of the Twitch's guidelines. On December 11, her account was banned. Her ban came after hosting a topless charity stream which raised funds for Doctors without Borders. Morgpie stated she was banned for \"engaging in lap dances, describing a sexual experience in graphic detail for a prolonged time, and making explicit gestures toward breasts, buttocks, or genitals on stream\"; she disputes that she did not engage in the former two on stream, though conceded she \"can kind of see\" the platform's reasoning for the latter. Nevertheless, she maintained that she previously read Twitch's terms of service (TOS), attempting to work within its confines, and stated that her streams \"are always labeled 18 plus\", in response to concerns about children potentially viewing sexually suggestive streams such as hers. Morgpie felt that community uproar around her content played a large role in her ban, reiterating that her topless meta was \"within TOS\". Her ban was shortlived, as she was unbanned days later. In the interim, Twitch made changes to their policies allowing for \"artistic depictions of nudity\", as well as \"deliberately highlighted breasts, buttocks or pelvic region\" as long as the content was properly labeled. However, the platform expeditiously rolled back their policy update the following day. In January 2024, Twitch again updated their policies, directly nixing the meta as streamers became prohibited to \"imply or suggest that they are fully or partially nude\".\nIn March 2024, Morgpie experimented with another meta, wearing a monochrome outfit and using her body as a green-screen. She made particular use of her buttocks as the green-screen projection area, such as in one stream where she reacted to a video by fellow streamer Cr1TiKaL. Debuting the style on March 12, she propelled the meta to gained traction a couple of days later, when she streamed her Fortnite gameplay overlaid on her buttocks. In another stream, she used a green-screen cut-out shirt, causing her head and breasts to be the only visible parts of her body. Like with the topless meta, this style of content proved to be controversial and led to a ban on \"content that focuses on intimate body parts for a prolonged period of time\" going into effect on March 29.\n\nReception and influence\nMorgpie polarized users with her topless meta. Male users in particular were noted by Morgan Sung of TechCrunch to be critical of implied nude content. Previously banned user Gross Gore \"derided topless meta creators [...] as a danger to children\". Conversely, Cr1TiKaL called Morgpie the \"most influential\" streamer on the platform at the time, opining that \"she defines the meta on Twitch\" and adding that the \"Twitch policy team has to constantly be monitoring her at her mercy\". Other male users parodied the meta. Passionfruit noted that Twitch received criticism regarding the multiple updates of their policies to prohibit implied nudity. Some users felt that the guideline updates would only negatively affect streamers with a smaller following. Meanwhile, other users, including Twitch affiliate Ren_Nyx, raised concerns over the perceived double standard between male and female-presenting streamers. They argued the policy change in January 2024 was unfairly gendered, applying only to female-presenting streamers.\nAs the topless meta became a popular trend in late 2023, it attracted copycats and spurred the onset of the \"black bar\" meta, in which streamers censored their breasts and genitals with black bars or other filters. The topless meta also drew comparisons to the previous \"hot tub\" meta, popularized by Amouranth in 2021, which featured streamers suggestively lounging in jacuzzis. Morgpie herself commented on this, stating that while she takes precaution to stay within TOS, streamers \"see the success that can be made from doing things like what Amouranth did with the hot tub streams\". Her buttocks green-screen meta also led to copycat streamers, who experimented with chroma keying various other body parts or using \"NSFW anime images\". VTubers were also influenced by the trend, PC Gamer citing one using a virtual avatar of \"an anime fox girl playing through a literal boob window\".  Writing for the Daily Dot, Grace Stanley opined positively on Morgpie's metas, stating \"She deserves awards, accolades, flowers even. Even if Twitch implemented a Catholic-school-level dress code, Morgpie would no doubt find a way to go viral for doing something funny\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMorgpie on Instagram\nMorgpie on Twitch\nMorgpie on Twitter",

        "content": "Faheem Rashad Najm (born September 30, 1984), known professionally as T-Pain, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, and record producer. He is known for popularizing creative use of Auto-Tune pitch correction, often used with extreme parameter settings to create electronic-styled vocal performances. Blending its use with R&B and hip-hop sensibilities, T-Pain became a prominent figure in both genres throughout the 2000s. Other music industry artists, such as Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Future, and Travis Scott, have since utilized Auto-Tune to a similar effect. \nT-Pain began his recording career as part of the hip-hop group Nappy Headz. He released his debut solo mixtape, Back @ It independently in 2004, and signed with Akon's Konvict Muzik, in a joint venture with Jive Records, the following year. His 2005 debut single, \"I'm Sprung\", was quickly met with commercial success, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and receiving platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its follow-up, \"I'm 'n Luv (wit a Stripper)\" (featuring Mike Jones), peaked at number five on the chart; both served as lead singles for his debut studio album, Rappa Ternt Sanga (2005). Despite moderate critical and commercial reception, his second album, Epiphany (2007), peaked atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-number one single \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\" (featuring Yung Joc), as well as the top-40 single, \"Bartender\" (featuring Akon). His third album, Three Ringz (2008), was preceded by the single \"Can't Believe It\" (featuring Lil Wayne), and his fourth album, Revolver (2011), was preceded by \"5 O'Clock\" (featuring Wiz Khalifa and Lily Allen). His fifth album, Oblivion (2017) sustained long-term delays and was met with critical and commercial failure, serving as his final release on a major label. \nMeanwhile, T-Pain saw continued success as a guest performer on nine Hot 100-top ten singles—\"Shawty\" by Plies, \"Cyclone\" by Baby Bash, \"Good Life\" by Kanye West, \"Shawty Get Loose\" by Lil Mama, \"Got Money\" by Lil Wayne, \"Blame It\" by Jamie Foxx, and \"Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)\" by Pitbull—which includes two singles that peaked the chart: \"Kiss Kiss\" by Chris Brown and \"Low\" by Flo Rida. The latter was named third in the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade and received diamond (10× platinum) certification by the RIAA. \"Good Life\" and \"Blame It\" both won Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance, respectively, from T-Pain's total of 12 nominations for the award. Outside of music, he founded the record label Nappy Boy Entertainment in 2005, and has signed Travie McCoy to brief commercial success. Furthermore, he has produced and written material for other artists, and voice acted in film and television including Tom & Jerry, Freaknik: The Musical, The Cleveland Show, Squidbillies, and We Bare Bears.\n\nEarly life\nNajm was born and raised in Tallahassee, Florida, to parents Aliyah, a Bahamian chef, and Shasheem, who founded the Homeboyz to Men program. Najm was brought up in a Muslim household, but he has expressed his lack of interest in the concept of religion. At three years old, he got his first taste of the music business when a friend of the family, gospel jazz artist and producer Ben Tankard, allowed him to spend time and \"twist the knobs\" at his recording studio. At age ten, Najm turned his bedroom into a music studio, using a keyboard, a beat machine, and a four-track recorder.\n\nCareer\n1999–2006: Early career and Rappa Ternt Sanga\nT-Pain joined the rap group Nappy Headz in 1999. Through a mutual connection with music promoter TJ Chapman, he was discovered by Rocco Did It Again! and Mike Blumstein—co-founders of the independent record label Chase Entertainment—to whom he signed. His stage name is short for \"Tallahassee Pain\", and was chosen because of the hardships he experienced while living there. He released his debut mixtape, Back @ It in 2004, and later released the song \"I'm Fucked Up\", a slightly altered cover version of Akon's then-popular 2004 single, \"Locked Up\". Akon himself came across the song and immediately offered T-Pain a deal with his label, Konvict Muzik. While T-Pain was offered other record deals, with the highest-bidding being US$900,000, Akon promised the young artist a personal mentorship in the industry. Meanwhile, Blumstein and Rocco remained involved in T-Pain's careers as joint co-managers. Afterward, T-Pain began singing instead of rapping, and used this inspiration to begin recording for his debut studio album, Rappa Ternt Sanga. Released on December 6, 2005, through a joint venture with Jive Records, the album reached number 33 on the Billboard 200, and has since received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nThe album was supported by T-Pain's debut commercial single, \"I'm Sprung\", which was released in August 2005 and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Its follow-up, \"I'm 'n Luv (wit a Stripper)\" (featuring Mike Jones), served as the album's second single; it was released in December of that year and peaked at number five on the former chart, and number ten on the latter. The third and final single from the album, \"Studio Luv\", was released in October 2006 and failed to chart.\n\n2007–2008: Epiphany\nIn mid-2006, T-Pain began work on his second album, now with the Zomba Label Group as well as his previous labels. The album, titled Epiphany, was released on June 5, 2007. The album sold 171,000 records in its first week, reaching number one on the Billboard 200. The record has since sold 819,000 records in the United States.\nThe album was preceded by the lead single \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\" (featuring Yung Joc), released in February 2007. The song reached number one on both the Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming his first to peak atop both charts. The album's second single, \"Bartender\" (featuring Akon), was released in June 2007 and reached number five on the Hot 100 and number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The third and final single from the album, \"Church\", was released in October 2007 and failed to chart in the United States.\nSpeaking in May 2007 to Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul about his reason for naming his second album 'Epiphany', T-Pain stated: \"One of the two dictionary meanings of epiphany is 'a sudden moment of insight or revelation'. And to me the title 'Epiphany' signifies the moment I realized that, to make the best music I can, I needed to just go in the studio and be myself, and not concentrate so hard on following other people's formulas.\" While promoting his second album, T-Pain made guest appearances on multiple songs by other artists. T-Pain was featured on \"I'm a Flirt\" (remix) by R. Kelly, \"Outta My System\" by Bow Wow, \"Baby Don't Go\" by Fabolous, \"I'm So Hood\" by DJ Khaled, \"Shawty\" by Plies, \"Kiss Kiss\" by Chris Brown, \"Low\" by Flo Rida, and \"Good Life\" by Kanye West. For two weeks in late 2007, T-Pain was featured on four top ten singles simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart.\nHis performance on West's \"Good Life\" won the BET Award for Best Collaboration and was nominated in several other categories. In 2008, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song.\n\n2007–2009: Three Ringz\nIn 2007, T-Pain began work on his third album, Three Ringz with Rocco Valdes, Akon, and Lil Wayne. The album was also his first under his newly launched label, Nappy Boy Entertainment. Released on November 11, 2008, the album sold 168,000 records in its first week and reached number four on the Billboard 200. A mixtape, Pr33 Ringz, was released in early 2008 for the album's promotion.\n\nThree Ringz was preceded by three singles; its lead single, \"Can't Believe It\" (featuring Lil Wayne), was released in July 2008 and reached number seven on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album's second single, \"Chopped 'n' Skrewed\" (featuring Ludacris), was released in September 2008; it reached number 27 on the Hot 100 and number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The third and final single from the album, \"Freeze\" (featuring Chris Brown), was released in October 2008; it reached number 38 on the Hot 100 and number 39 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Guest appearances on Three Ringz include T.I., Lil Wayne, Ludacris, DJ Khaled, Ciara, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others. \nIn 2008, T-Pain continued to guest perform on numerous singles, such as \"She Got It\" by 2 Pistols, \"Go Girl\" by Ciara, \"The Boss\" by Rick Ross, \"Cash Flow\" by Ace Hood, \"Shawty Get Loose\" by Lil Mama, \"One More Drink\" by Ludacris, and \"Go Hard\" by DJ Khaled.

T-Pain appeared again on SNL in February 2009 (season 34, episode 15, hosted by Bradley Cooper with musical guest TV on the Radio) as a feature in the Digital Short premiere of The Lonely Island's single, \"I'm on a Boat,\" off their album Incredibad. T-Pain also supported the album in 2009 with his Thr33 Ringz Tour, which included sold-out shows across North America. T-Pain and Lil Wayne formed the duo T-Wayne in 2008. The duo released a self-titled mixtape in late 2008; it charted on the Billboard 200 in January 2009.

In March 2010, T-Pain developed and starred in Adult Swim's animated musical special, Freaknik: The Musical.\nT-Pain released a mixtape on his Nappy Boy label in February 2010, T-Pain Presents: Nappy Boy All Stars Vol.1, which contained remixes of songs including \"Forever\" by Drake.

It premiered on March 7, 2010, and features many guest celebrities such as Lil Wayne, Young Cash, Snoop Dogg, Sophia Fresh, Rick Ross, Andy Samberg, and Charlie Murphy.\nT-Pain made his cinema acting debut in the 2010 comedy film Lottery Ticket as a liquor store clerk.\nIn November 2016, T-Pain also appeared in an episode of the YouTube series Epic Rap Battles of History as Stevie Wonder.\nT-Pain was the champion of the first season of the Fox reality music competition The Masked Singer as \"Monster\". He returned as a guest panelist in the sixth episode of season 3.\nSince 2018, T-Pain has been the host of T-Pain's School of Business, a documentary series airing on Fuse in which T-Pain travels around the United States meeting with different entrepreneurs. The series has aired for two seasons so far: the first in 2018, which had six episodes, and the second in 2019, which had eight episodes.\n\nVideo games\nT-Pain has confirmed his involvement in the development of the upcoming video game Grand Theft Auto VI, although his role has not been specified.\n\nMusical style\nT-Pain defined in 2005 his own music style as \"Hard & B\", a play on R&B. In 2024, T-Pain said that country and gospel music were major influences on his music.\nHe mentioned GarageBand and Logic Pro as the software he uses to produce his own beats.\n\nUse of Auto-Tune\nMusically, T-Pain is best known for popularizing the use of Auto-Tune, a pitch-correcting audio processor, for vocals, with the effect turned up to give the voice a robotic quality. He has used this effect throughout his singing career, starting in 2003. This use of Auto-Tune had been pioneered by Cher in her successful 1998 single \"Believe\". T-Pain, who had been looking for a way to make his voice sound unique, was inspired to use Auto-Tune after hearing the Darkchild remix of the 1999 song \"If You Had My Love\" by Jennifer Lopez, which makes occasional use of the effect. He was also inspired in part by a similar sound achieved by Roger Troutman in the 1980s (using a talk box) and Teddy Riley in the 1990s (using both talk boxes and vocoders).\nAfter the success of T-Pain's first two albums, his use of Auto-Tune was replicated by a number of hip-hop artists, including Snoop Dogg on the 2007 single \"Sensual Seduction\", Lil Wayne on the 2008 single \"Lollipop\", Kanye West on the 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak (on which T-Pain served as a consultant), the Black Eyed Peas on the 2009 single \"Boom Boom Pow\", and Diddy – Dirty Money on the 2010 album Last Train to Paris. In a November 2008 interview, T-Pain revealed that Diddy had paid him for the right to use Auto-Tune in T-Pain's style on the then-upcoming Last Train to Paris, and he felt that other artists should do the same.\nIn 2009, Jay-Z released the single \"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\", which criticized the practice. The song directly mentioned T-Pain, with the lyrics \"You niggas singing too much/ Get back to rap, you T-Paining too much.\" Jay-Z has insisted that the song was not a personal attack on T-Pain, and that he was simply criticizing a trend that he felt had run its course. T-Pain has said that he loved the song. However, he felt personally hurt by a general backlash against the use of Auto-Tune that began at around the same time. Nevertheless, he has continued to use Auto-Tune, feeling that it is simply part of his musical style, as opposed to jumping on a trend as was the case for other artists.\n\nPersonal life\nT-Pain has been married to Amber since 2003. They have three children: one daughter, Lyriq, and two sons Muziq and Kaydnz Kodah (born May 2009).\nOn March 27, 2009, T-Pain was involved in a golf cart accident, the same day he was due for a music video shoot for Lil' Kim's song \"Download\". He suffered cuts, bruises, and four missing teeth and had emergency dental work done. He returned to performing two days later.\nOn April 1, 2013, T-Pain revealed that he had cut off his iconic dreadlocks, stating \"We must all learn to adjust with our surroundings. Those who get stuck doing the same things for too long are bound to get left behind the strong who press on & reinvent themselves. Also good news hair grows back.\"\nOn August 30, 2016, T-Pain's niece, Javona Glover, was stabbed to death in a local Walgreens store in his hometown of Tallahassee. In 2017, a suspect in the case was found dead in an apparent suicide.\nT-Pain's brother died in early 2019.\nT-Pain is an avid gamer who regularly streams on Twitch. He joined the platform in 2015 and as of 2025 has 1 million followers on the service, while holding numerous events in collaboration with the platform. He is friends with Cr1TiKaL, having appeared in his streams occasionally and stood in for him in a single video (while Cr1TiKal humorously feigned retirement) in 2025. He has many tattoos, some of which are internet memes or otherwise Internet-related.\n\nLegal issues\nOn April 28, 2007, T-Pain refused to shorten his performance at Radio One's Spring Fest Concert in Miami, which caused police presence to increase backstage. After concert officials aborted his performance of \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\", police chased him and his entourage off-stage and out of the premises and detained them.\nIn June 2007, a warrant was issued for T-Pain's arrest for driving with a suspended license. He subsequently turned himself in to the Leon County Jail on November 2, 2007. He was held without bail, but was released three hours later.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\nRappa Ternt Sanga (2005)\nEpiphany (2007)\nThree Ringz (2008)\nRevolver (2011)\nOblivion (2017)\n1UP (2019)\nOn Top of the Covers (2023)\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nAwards and nominations\nAmerican Music Awards\n2007, Favorite Male Artist (Nominated)\nBET Awards\n2009, Best Male R&B Artist (Nominated)\n2009, Best Collaboration (\"Blame It\") with Jamie Foxx (Won)\n2009, Viewer's Choice (\"Can't Believe It\") with Lil Wayne (Nominated)\n2008, Best Collaboration (\"Kiss Kiss\") with Chris Brown (Nominated)\n2008, Best Collaboration (\"Low\") with Flo Rida (Nominated)\n2008, Viewer's Choice (\"Kiss Kiss\") with Chris Brown (Nominated)\n2008, Best Collaboration (\"Good Life\") with Kanye West (Won)\n2008, Video of the Year (\"Good Life\") with Kanye West (Nominated)\nBET Hip Hop Awards\n2009.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstone",
        "content": "Johnstone (Scots: Johnstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Iain) is a town in the administrative area of Renfrewshire and larger historic county of the same name, in the west central Lowlands of Scotland.\nThe town lies 3 miles (5 km) west of neighbouring Paisley, 12 miles (19 km) west of the centre of the city of Glasgow and 12 miles (19 km) north east of Kilwinning. Part of the biggest conurbation in Scotland, Johnstone is at the western edge of the Greater Glasgow Urban Area.\n\nHistory\nJohnstone was largely a planned community which grew up around the house of Easter Cochrane, later known as Johnstone Castle, seat of the Houston or Houstoun family who gained their name from the nearby village of Houston. In 1782, the Laird, George Houstoun, commissioned designs for a series of regular residential streets, which now form the town centre. At this early stage of development, the town's population including the local estate and rural hinterland was around 1,500. Two mirroring civic squares were also constructed in the town: Houstoun Square and Ludovic Square, the latter named for the Laird's son, and by 1794 the town had gained its current parish church. Johnstone was raised to the status of a police burgh with significant local powers, a status which is now defunct. The former court building continues to stand in Collier Street.\nIndustrial development brought both prosperity and poverty to the community. Coal mining occurred in Johnstone, although its main industry was related to the thread and cotton industries, with mills powered by the Black Cart Water which runs to the north of Johnstone. A six-storey cotton mill, one of the largest in Scotland, was built in 1782, and was rescued from failure by Robert Burns of Paisley sometime before 1812. Burns introduced Richard Arkwright's methods for spinning cotton. As the community expanded, slum conditions formed in part of the town: the population by 1831 had increased to a sizeable 5,600. Unfortunately, the owners of Johnstone mill did not make much philanthropic progress among their worker population, and the situation was not addressed until the 1930s by a significant expansion of the size of Johnstone to include a number of purpose-built residential estates.\nMuch of Johnstone's feudal heritage has disappeared. With the death of the last Laird in 1931, Johnstone Castle fell into disrepair before being largely demolished in 1950. The remaining tower was purchased in 2001 and is now a private residence. On the site of the former grounds now lies two housing estates, Johnstone Castle and Cochrane Castle. Embedded within Cochrane Castle is the Cochrane Castle Golf Club, which once held the world record for the longest hole.\nMore recently, Johnstone History Museum opened in 2008 – notably becoming the world's first museum located inside a supermarket.\nIn 2015, the new Town Hall was completed at a cost of £14.5m.\nThe town is home to Johnstone Pipe Band who compete in the highest level of pipe band competitions, Grade 1. The band was founded in 1943 and wears the Blue Mackay tartan.\n\nEducation\nThorn Public School, as it was originally called, opened in 1904. A new Thorn primary school opened in 1988, the same year that the former building was demolished. The old site is now occupied by a housing estate, although parts of the original walls are still standing. In 1950 St. David's Primary School was built along with its sister school Cochrane Castle Primary School. In 2007 the two schools were housed in a new shared building nearby, 'West Johnstone Shared Campus', just outside Thomas Shanks Public Park, the locations of the original schools (between Dundonald Avenue and Craigview Avenue) remain overgrown 'gap sites' awaiting redevelopment.\nJohnstone High School opened on its current site off Beith Road in March 1965, the previous building in Ludovic Square having burnt down in 1960 (there is now a modern health centre on its site). Its redeveloped campus opened in late 2009.\nThe original St Cuthberts High School was built adjacent to Johnstone High School and shared the same driveway and car parks. The school closed in 1972 and moved to a new site in Hallhill Road, Spateston that year. The original school was demolished and replaced by a housing development to the left of the driveway of Johnstone High School. The school at Spateston closed at the end of the summer term of 2006 along with St Brendan's High School in Linwood due to falling rolls and the buildings' poor state of repair. These were replaced by a new build St Benedict's High School at Linwood (named in honour of St Benedict of Nursia, the patron saint of Europe and of students). The old St Cuthbert's building was used to house several schools while their own premises were being refurbished (including Johnstone High School from 2008 to 2009). It was also subsequently demolished in 2010 and has since been replaced by new housing.\n\nReligion\nThe town contains churches of several Christian denominations: three Church of Scotland, two Roman Catholic, one Scottish Episcopal Church, one Evangelical and one Baptist.\n\nSports\nThe town is home to the Johnstone Burgh and Thorn Athletic football teams, which currently play in the Premier and Third Divisions of the West of Scotland Football League respectively.\n\nPolitics\nThe town is split between the Johnstone South and Elderslie and Johnstone North, Kilbarchan, Howwood and Lochwinnoch wards for elections to Renfrewshire Council, which elect four councillors each using the Single Transferable Vote. The 2022 Renfrewshire Council election saw councillors elected across the two wards being four Labour Party, three Scottish National Party (SNP) and one Independent.\nFor elections to the Scottish Parliament, Johnstone is included in the constituency of Renfrewshire South, currently held by SNP politician Tom Arthur since 2016. Johnstone is also included in the West Scotland region which elects seven additional members. In the UK Parliament the town is contained within the seat of Paisley and Renfrewshire South, represented by the Labour Party's Johanna Baxter since the 2024 general election.\n\nTransport\nAir\nJohnstone is served by Glasgow International Airport, which is located 3+1⁄2 miles (5.6 km) northeast of the town. Moreover, Prestwick International Airport is a 30-to-40-minute train journey from Johnstone railway station.\n\nRoad\nA dual carriageway, the A737, connects Johnstone to the M8 motorway to provide car transport links to central Scotland.\n\nBus services\nMcGill's Bus Service Limited operate the majority of local services from their depot in the west end of Johnstone, running the following routes serving the town\n\n1/1A: Johnstone – Kilmacolm\n2/2A: Johnstone – Bridge of Weir\n20:   Johnstone – Paisley (via Cochrane Castle, Johnstone Castle, Elderslie and the Royal Alexandria Hospital)\n30: Johnstone - Spateston\n32: Johnstone - Kilbarchan\n38: Glasgow – Paisley – Johnstone - Spateston/Kilbarchan\n307: Johnstone - Lochwinnoch\n904: Largs – Kilbirnie – Beith – Howwood – Johnstone – Paisley\nShuttle Buses, based in Kilwinning, Ayrshire runs the following services:\n\n1: Johnstone – Johnstone Castle\n4: Johnstone – Lochwinnoch\n5: Johnstone – Spateston\n\nRail\nJohnstone is linked to Glasgow Central, Paisley and the Ayrshire coast by the Johnstone railway station which is located at the east of the town on Thorn Brae. A second unmanned station Milliken Park railway station lies at the west end of the town, just off the Cochranemill road.\nThe railway line runs through the cutting of the old Glasgow–Ardrossan Canal, although the route of the canal runs under the original bridge, Dick's Bridge, at the bottom of the Thorn Brae, where the canal basin was situated and in winter, the rim of the canal basin sometimes becomes visible.\nIt may be noted that a second railway line ran through the town serving the villages of Kilbarchan, Bridge of Weir, and Kilmacolm; the line now forms part of the Clyde to Forth cycle route (National Cycle Route 75). It had a station serving the Northern, more industrial areas of town, Johnstone North railway station.\n\nNotable inhabitants\nSir William Arrol – Worked as a boy at the Johnstone mills before becoming the architect of Forth Rail Bridge and Tower Bridge in London\nAdam Brown – professional ice hockey player; born in Johnstone in 1920, active in the NHL 1941–1952\nTommy Bryce – professional footballer\nWilliam Clunas – Scotland and Sunderland footballer; played in the first England v Scotland match at Wembley Stadium in 1924\nHunter Davies – journalist, author and broadcaster\nJohn Deans – professional footballer\nRobert Pollock Gillespie  – mathematician\nRenee Houston – music hall and comedy actress; born in Johnstone in 1902, attended St Margaret's Primary School\nJim Leighton – professional footballer, attended St. Cuthbert's Secondary School\nPhyllis Logan – actress; attended Johnstone High School in the 1970s\nAnnie McGuire – BBC Journalist, born in Elderslie, attended St.Cuthbert's Secondary School\nAlexander McLachlan – poet, born at the Brig in 1818\nJohn Pitcairn, Jr. – Scottish-American industrialist; born in Johnstone, emigrated to the United States aged five\nGordon Ramsay – celebrity chef and TV host, born in Johnstone\nSir George Reid – 4th Prime Minister of Australia (18 August 1904 – 5 July 1905); was Prime Minister for ten months and 17 days, Australia's first federal Leader of the Opposition, federal government's first High Commissioner to the UK\nPeter Tobin – serial killer, born in Johnstone in 1946\nTommy Turner – professional footballer\nAlba Fyre - professional wrestler\n\nSee also\nJohnstone Burgh F.C.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nJohnstone Community Council",

        "content": "In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos (Ancient Greek: δῆμος, plural: demoi, δήμοι) was a suburb or a subdivision of Athens and other city-states. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC.  In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the main city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Athens was divided into 139 demes. Three other demes were created subsequently: Berenikidai (224/223 BC), Apollonieis (201/200 BC), and Antinoeis (AD 126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.\nA deme functioned to some degree as a polis in miniature, and indeed some demes, such as Eleusis and Acharnae, were in fact significant towns. Each deme had a demarchos who supervised its affairs; various other civil, religious, and military functionaries existed in various demes. Demes held their own religious festivals and collected and spent revenue.\nDemes were combined within the same area to make trittyes, larger population groups, which in turn were combined to form the ten tribes, or phylai, of Athens. Each tribe contained one trittys from each of three regions: the city, the coast, and the inland area.\n\nCleisthenes' reforms and modifications\nFirst period: 508 – 307/306 BC\nCleisthenes divided the landscape in three zones—urban (asty), coastal (paralia) and inland (mesogeia)—and the 139 demes were organized into 30 groups called trittyes (\"thirds\"), ten for each of the zones and into ten tribes, or phylai, each composed of three trittyes, one from the coast, one from the city, and one from the inland area.\nCleisthenes also reorganized the Boule, created with 400 members under Solon, so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe, each deme having a fixed quota.\nThe ten tribes were named after legendary heroes and came to have an official order:\n\nSecond period: 307/306 – 224/223 BC\nIn 307/306 – 224/223 BC the system was reorganized with the creation of two Macedonian Phylai (XI. Antigonis and XII. Demetrias), named after Demetrius I of Macedon and Antigonus I Monophthalmus, and an increase in the membership of the Boule to 600. Each of the ten tribes, except Aiantis, provided three demes (not necessarily one for trittyes); the missing contribution of Aiantis was covered by two demes of Leontis and one from Aigeis.\n\nThird period: 224/223 – 201/200 BC\nThe Egyptian Phyle XIII. Ptolemais, named after Ptolemy III Euergetes was created in 224/223 BC and the Boule was again increased, this time to 650 members, the twelve tribes giving each a demos. A new village was created and named Berenikidai after Ptolemy's wife Berenice II of Egypt.\n\nFourth period: 201/200 BC – 126/127 AD\nIn 201/200 BC the Macedonian Phylae were dissolved and the villages (except the two given to Ptolemais) went back to their original tribes. In the spring of 200 BC Tribe XIV. Attalis, named after Attalus I, was created following the same scheme used for the creation of the Egyptian Phyle: each tribe contributed a deme and a new deme, Apollonieis, was created in honour of Apollonis, wife of Attalus I of Pergamum. As a consequence there were again 12 tribes and 600 members of the Boule. From this period onward, quotas were no longer assigned to the demes for the 50 Boule members from each tribe.\n\nFifth period: 126/127 – third century\nThe last modification was the creation in 126/127 of XV. Hadrianis, named after the Emperor Hadrian, following the same scheme: each tribe contributed a deme and a new deme, Antinoeis, was created in honour of Hadrian's favourite, Antinous. Each tribe contributed 40 members to the Boule.\n\nRepresentation in the Boule\nIn the first three periods there it a more detailed system of fixed quotas which essentially remained unchanged. There is no evidence for a single general reapportionment of quotas within each of the first three periods, while there are evident small quota-variations between the first and the second periods.\nMore precisely in:\n\n307/306 BC, 24 demes increased of 1 bouleutes, 13 of 2, 5 or 3, 6 of 4 and 1 (Lower Paiania) of 11 and there is not a single example of a decreased quota.\n224/223 BC 4 demes increased of 1 bouletes\nAs regards the last two periods, the material illustrates the complete collapse of the quota-system from 201/200 BC.\n\nSpurious and Late Roman demes\nSome deme lists suggest extensions to the list of 139+3 Demes by adding 43 additional names, some of which have been considered by scholars as Attic demes. The criticism performed by John S. Traill shows that 24 are the result of error, ancient or modern, or of misinterpretation and 19 are well known chiefly from inscriptions of the second and third centuries AD, i.e. in the fifth period, and thus for political purposes they were originally dependent on legitimate Cleisthenic demes.\n\nHomonymous and divided demes\nThere were six pairs of homonymous demes:\n\nHalai Araphenides (VII.Kekropis) and Halai Aixonides (II.Aigeis)\nOion Dekeleikon (VIII.Hippothontis; later XIII.Ptolemais, XIV.Attalis) and Oion Kerameikon (IV.Leontis; affiliated with XII.Demetrias in the Macedonian period)\nEitea: there were two demes of that name, but no modifier is known. One is associated to V.Acamantis, later XI.Antigonis and XV.Hadrianis; the other is associated to X.Antiochis\nOinoe and Oinoe: again no modifier is known; one deme was associated to VIII.Hippothontis, later XII.Demetrias and XIII.Ptolemais; the other was associated to IX.Aiantis, later XIV.Attalis and XV.Hadrianis.\nKolonai: again no modifier is known; one deme was associated to IV.Leontis; the other to X.Antiochis, later XI.Antigonis and XIII.Ptolemais.\nEroiadai: again no modifier is known for these two demes associated to VIII.Hippothontis and X.Antiochis.\nThere were six divided demes, one composed of three parts:\n\nAgryle, Upper Agryle and Lower Agryle (I.Erechtheis); one of them, but there is no prosopographical information for identifying which, was transferred to XI.Antigonis and went back at the end of the Macedonian period; later one of them (again it is uncertain which) was transferred to XIV.Attalis.\nLamptrai, Upper Lamptrai and Coastal/Lower Lamptrai (I.Erechtheis); Upper Lamptrai was transferred to XI.Antigonis and went back at the end of the Macedonian period.\nPergase, Upper and Lower (I.Erechtheis); one of them (no prosopographical information allows to decide which) was transferred to XI.Antigonis and went back at the end of the Macedonian period.\nAnkyle: no special designations of either section are preserved, although they are presumed to have the regular Upper and Lower forms. One section, perhaps Upper Ankale, was transferred to XI.Antigonis and went back at the end of the Macedonian period.\nPaiania, Upper Paiania and Lower Paiania (III.Pandionis); Upper Paiania, was transferred to XI.Antigonis and went back at the end of the Macedonian period.\nPotamos has three sections, Upper Potamos, Lower Potamos and Potamos Deiradiotes (IV.Leontes); during the Macedonian period, Potamos Deiradiotes belonged to XI.Antigonis and Lower Potamos to XII.Demetrias.\n\nList of Athenian demes according to tribes/phylai (φυλαί)\nThe ten Cleisthenic tribes\nThe Macedonian tribes\nThe later tribes\nThe ten tribes of Thurii\nWhen the city was settled under the support of Pericles and the command of Lampon and Xenocritus the population was organized in ten tribes, following the Athenian organization: there were tribes for the population of  1. Arcadia, 2. Achaea, 3. Elis, 4. Boeotia, 5. Delphi, 6. Dorians, 7. Ionians, 8. population of Euboea, 9. the islands and 10. Athenians.\n\nLater usage\nThe term \"deme\" (dēmos) survived into the Hellenistic and Roman eras. By the time of the Byzantine Empire, the term was used to refer to one of the four chariot racing factions, the Reds, the Blues, the Greens and the Whites.\nIn modern Greece, the term dēmos is used to denote one of the municipalities.\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nTraill, John S.

        "content": "AREX (Airport Railroad Express; Korean: 인천국제공항철도) is a South Korean airport rail link and commuter rail line that links Incheon International Airport with Seoul Station via Gimpo International Airport.\nThe section between the two airports opened on March 23, 2007, and the line was extended to Seoul Station on December 29, 2010. \nLong-distance Korea Train Express high speed trains started to use the line from June 30, 2014, but discontinued the service in March 2018 due to low ridership.\n\nHistory\nPhase 1\nThe line was initially announced in July 1998 as the Incheon International Airport Railroad (인천국제공항철도), abbreviated IREX (Incheon Airport Railroad Express) which can be seen on the railings of overhead crossings by the line. The project was launched as South Korea's first build-operate-transfer (BOT) franchise. The concession was won by a consortium of 11 Korean companies, which incorporated as the Incheon International Airport Railroad Company (IIARCo) in March 2001. The original main shareholders were Hyundai (27%), POSCO (11.9%), Daelim (10%), Dongbu (10%) and the Korean National Railroad (9.9%).\nAfter significant delays, construction of the line started in 2001, after the opening of Incheon Airport. About 60% of the line is underground, and reaches Incheon International Airport on Yeongjong Island via the lower deck of Yeongjong Bridge, a combined road-rail bridge. IIARCo contracted project management and the supply of equipment and trains, altogether worth about €400 million, to Incheon Korean French Consortium (IKFC). This consortium includes French company Alstom, its South Korean subsidiary Eukorail, and the South Korean rolling stock manufacturing company Rotem, which also supplied the technology for the KTX high-speed rail system.\nThe line and the operating company was renamed AREX in June 2006. The first 37.6 km (23.4 mi) segment from Incheon International Airport Terminal 1 to Gimpo International Airport opened on March 23, 2007. This makes AREX the first dedicated airport rail link and the second railway line in the Korean Peninsula (after Seoul Subway Line 5) to directly serve an airport.\nIn March 2009, Korail acquired an 88.8% share of the company. Upon the acquisition, the operating company changed its name to Korail Airport Railroad as of November 30, 2009.\n\nPhase 2\nPhase 2 of the line runs from Gimpo International Airport to Seoul Station, which increased the length to 58 km (36 mi). At Gimpo the line is underground, rising to the surface to cross the Han River on the Magok Railway Bridge before descending underground for the final time. This section was built in a cut and cover tunnel running parallel to Susaek and Gajwa before connecting with Hongik University and Gongdeok, then diving to terminate deep underground on the west side of Seoul Station. The second phase opened for regular service on December 29, 2010, with the exception of Gongdeok station, which was planned to open around early 2011, but was delayed to November 29, 2011.\n\nPhase 3\nPhase 3 of the line was opened in September 2018. During phase 3 Magongnaru station was opened.\n\nFurther extensions and improvements\nThe city of Incheon requested that AREX add three new stations at Cheongna International City, Yeongjong, and Yongyu. The stations were originally planned to open with the second phase of the line, but were delayed due to delays in the real estate development projects the stations were to serve. Cheongna International City station, located west of Geomam was opened on June 21, 2014. Yeongjong station, located near the eastern part of the airport island, opened on March 26, 2016. The station was constructed as a station shell with two side platforms only, but underwent a conversion to fit in two outer tracks on each platform to allow for bypass moves.\nEarlier plans to link Yongsan station have been dropped. However, KTX service began to run from Yongsan Station to Incheon International Airport on June 30, 2014. These trains stop at two stations along the line: Geomam & Incheon International Airport. In March 2018, KTX service to Incheon Airport was suspended due to low ridership. The suspension became permanent in September 2018 as the line was officially abolished.\nOn September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the AREX line is to be further upgraded to handle 230 km/h (143 mph) speed limits.\nIncheon International Airport opened Terminal 2 on January 18, 2018, though the AREX line was extended to the terminal's station 5 days earlier. This brings the whole line to a length of 63.8 km (39.6 mi).\nThere is currently a proposal for Seoul Subway Line 9 to combine with the AREX line via a direct connection at the Gimpo International Airport Station starting in 2020, providing a through service from Incheon International Airport to the Gangnam area with a travel time of about one hour.\n\nRolling stock\nAREX operates two types of trains, one for commuter and one for express services, both supplied by Hyundai Rotem. Three 1000 series express trains and nine 2000 series commuter trains were delivered for phase 1 of the project, and original plans foresaw a doubling of their numbers for the second phase.\nBoth trains are six-car electric multiple units, which can be expanded to eight cars in the future. End cars and the fourth car are trailers, the second, third and fifth car are powered. The trains have a design speed of 120 km/h (75 mph), but are operated at a maximum 110 km/h (68 mph) on surface tracks and a maximum 100 km/h (62 mph) in tunnels. Each car has a length of 19.95 m (65 ft 5 in) and a width of 3.12 m (10 ft 3 in), with a carbody made of aluminium. The commuter version has four pairs of sliding doors on each side of each car, the express version has two pairs of sliding doors on each side of each car.\nExpress trains have 272 high-back forward and rear-facing seats with armrests in a 2+2 configuration, as well as overhead luggage shelves, additional luggage racks, an onboard restroom, and complimentary WiFi. The transition between cars are separated by transparent sliding doors.\nCommuter trains are similar to regular metro trains with seats along the walls but do not have overhead shelves. These are open gangway trains, with no separating doors between cars. Commuter trains offer seating for 282 passengers and standing room for 630 passengers.\nBoth train types offer disabled seats and are equipped with LCD screens for passenger information, including flight arrivals and departures.\n\nOperation\nServices\nBoth non-stop Express and all-stops commuter services are operated. With the opening of the first phase, journeys from Incheon International Airport to Gimpo International Airport took 28 minutes on express services and 33 minutes on commuter services. Following the opening of the second phase, Seoul–Incheon International Airport travel time on half-hourly Express services is 43 minutes to Terminal 1. The all-stops commuter service, which runs at a frequency of up to one train every 6 minutes, takes 53 minutes. This compares with an average travel time of 70 minutes on buses and 60 minutes in taxis or private cars.\nExpress train passengers boarding certain airlines can check in to their flights at the Seoul Station City Airport Terminal on the western side of Seoul Station, which include facilities to check in and x-ray baggage, receive exit stamps from an onsite Korean Immigration Service officer, and permit expedited security screening once at Incheon.\nThe AREX line is shown on Seoul subway maps as sky blue, often bisected with orange striping. AREX was originally not considered part of the subway network, but following the majority buyout by Korail, who operates many of Seoul's subway lines, the commuter line was fully integrated with the rest of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system. There are now free transfers for all Seoul and Incheon metro lines it crosses paths with.\n\nAREX Express trains\nAREX Express train stations and ticket windows are easily by their distinct orange color scheme. AREX Express trains offer 2+2 configured reclining seating, ample luggage storage, free WiFi, onboard service attendants and electronic entertainment screens. AREX Express passengers have access to connecting shuttle buses at Seoul Station to partner hotels, to a dedicated boarding lounge at Incheon Airport Terminal 1, and exclusive use of Seoul Station's City Airport Terminal when departing. All seats on the AREX Express trains are reserved, with receipts displaying the assigned car and seat numbers for passengers alongside their tickets.\n\nGimpo International Airport\nAREX-Express trains do not stop at Gimpo International Airport. To access Gimpo International Airport from both Seoul Station and Incheon International Airport, passengers need to travel on an all-stops train.\n\nKTX\nThe opening of the second phase in 2010 allowed passengers to connect directly from KTX to AREX services at Seoul Station, rather than requiring a subway connection at Gimpo. In November 2013, the AREX-Gyeongui Line direct connection was completed, and on June 30, 2014, KTX trains started full service on the AREX line to Incheon. The expected travel time at construction was 2 hours 41 minutes to Busan and 3 hours to Gwangju, but as of 2015, actual travel times were roughly 3 hours to Gwangju and slightly over 3.5 to Busan.\nIn late March 2018, KTX service to and from the airport was suspended because of low ridership and the suspension became permanent in September 2018 as the line was officially abolished. At the time of the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport reported at 15% demand on weekdays.\n\nFares\nAfter the opening of the first phase, in 2007, a ticket for a ride from Gimpo International Airport to Incheon International Airport cost ₩3,100, both on commuter and express services. This fare increased in steps to ₩3,500 by the end of 2010, then was reduced to ₩3,300 for commuter trains when the second phase opened. The fare for express services, which travel the full Seoul–Incheon International Airport distance non-stop from the opening of the second phase in December 2010, was set at ₩13,300; while the fare for commuter services on the full distance was set at ₩3,700. This competes against a price of around ₩10,000 on buses, ₩67,500 on taxis, and about ₩15,500 with private car.\nBy 2022, the fares for the full length of the AREX line settled on ₩4,750 for commuter trains, and ₩9,500 for Express service and both require an additional ₩500 deposit if traveling by a single use card.\nVending machines for local trains accept Korean Won only. Vending machines for Express train tickets take Korean Won and Korean credit cards. Passengers travelling with foreign credit cards must purchase their tickets from staffed ticket windows.\n\nRidership\nAfter the opening of the first phase, ridership has been far below expectations. Actual ridership in 2008 was around 16,000 passengers/day, or only around 7% of the forecast 230,000, necessitating subsidies of ₩166 billion. Hyundai had originally forecast ridership of up to 490,000/day when the link to Seoul Station is completed. However, ridership rose significantly after the start of service on the second phase of the line to Seoul Station. As early as the first week, average daily ridership more than doubled, from 27,210 to 58,000.\nAs of September 2013, the all-stops commuter service has approximately 150,000 passengers per day, while the non-stop express service sees only around 2,000 passengers.\n\nStations\nSee also\nSeoul Station City Airport Terminal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nThe Daily Kimchi: Pictures and Videos of the AREX line",

        "content": "Juan Manuel DeBiedma (; born June 21, 1993), better known by his alias Hungrybox, is an Argentine–American professional Super Smash Bros. player, streamer, tournament organizer and commentator. Recognized as one of the greatest and most successful Super Smash Bros. Melee players of all time, he is one of the \"Five Gods of Melee\" along with Adam \"Armada\" Lindgren, Jason \"Mew2King\" Zimmerman, Joseph \"Mang0\" Marquez, and Kevin \"PPMD\" Nanney, and is regarded as the greatest Jigglypuff player in history. He is also an active competitor in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and has been a member of Team Liquid since 2015, becoming its co-owner in December 2021.\nHungrybox has won 38 major Melee Singles tournaments between 2009 and 2025, including editions of Apex, The Big House, CEO, DreamHack, EVO, GENESIS, the MLG National Championship, and Smash Summit. He has been ranked one of the top ten Melee players in the world every year since formal rankings began in 2013, achieving the top rank a record three consecutive times from 2017 to 2019; retroactive rankings establish him as a top ten player in the world every year since 2009, and rank him number one for 2010.\nA 2021 list compiled by PGstats ranked DeBiedma as the third-greatest Melee player of all time. Despite his \"God\" status, he is considered one of the most polarizing figures in the Melee community, in part due to the unpopularity of his defensive, counterattack-centric playstyle among part of the community.\nBorn in Argentina, DeBiedma grew up in Orlando, Florida, and became a U.S. citizen in 2017. Hungrybox has also competed in Super Smash Bros. games subsequent to Melee, and won both Project M and Ultimate tournaments. Although primarily known as a Singles player, he also has an extensive career in Melee Doubles, and partnered up with a variety of other players, most notably Mew2King and Justin \"Plup\" McGrath, both of whom he won major Doubles tournaments with; he has been managed by his lifelong best friend Luis \"Crunch\" Rosias for the entirety of his career. He also regularly acts as commentator, and is the creator of the mostly-online The Box series of Super Smash Bros. tournaments created in 2020, which include Coinbox, the largest online Ultimate tournament series.\n\nEarly life\nJuan Manuel DeBiedma was born in Argentina on June 21, 1993, to Juan Daniel Debiedma, a diplomat for Argentina, and Lucia Violante, a flight attendant. He has two older brothers, Gaston, the oldest, and Fermin. In the mid-1990s, DeBiedma's family moved to Orlando, Florida, after which Violante became a real estate agent.\nDeBiedma played piano and sang a capella while growing up. He discovered video games at a young age, particularly enjoying the Super Mario Advance series, and started playing Melee when he was little after the stepson of one of his father's co-workers introduced him to the game. He would also often play Super Smash Bros. Brawl with Fermin. DeBiedma and his lifelong best friend and future manager, Luis \"Crunch\" Rosias, met in fifth grade in Orlando, and would often play Melee together. He originally used Ness as his main character, but switched to Jigglypuff after realizing the effectiveness of the \"Rest\" move.\nHis eventual nickname, \"Hungrybox\", came from middle school after he failed to forge his mother's signature, producing a drawing instead. He kept on recreating the drawing when bored in class, eventually resulting in a \"hungry box\" character resembling a box with eyes and a jagged mouth.\nDeBiedma was abandoned by his father Juan Daniel when he was 15 years old; they last saw each other July 20, 2008, when Juan Daniel dropped him off at the venue for the Brawl tournament Fast 1 before flying back to Argentina.\n\nEsports career\nEarly career (2007–2013)\nDeBiedma discovered the Super Smash Bros. competitive scene sometime between 2006–2007 and started to perform at small local tournaments in 2007. In July 2008, he volunteered to host several players at his parents' home for the upcoming 122-player Brawl tournament named Fast 1. He himself took part of the tournament, finishing in 25th place.\nIn 2009 at a local Tampa tournament, Twilight Showdown 6, he placed 3rd for the first time in any tournament, earning $27.50, his first prize money; he recognizes this as the first moment he considered becoming professional. After finishing in 7th place at Revival of Melee on March 7, Hungrybox placed 3rd at GENESIS for Melee on July 11, his first high placement at a major Melee tournament, while placing 97th on Brawl the following day. Hungrybox won his first-ever tournament at Revival of Melee 2 on November 21, 2009. He then went on to place in high positions repeatedly on tournaments, with Apex 2010 on August 8 marking his first win in a major tournament.\nFor the following years, Hungrybox remained one of the top Melee players, and established himself as the best Jigglypuff player in the world. Results in major tournaments included placing 2nd at both Apex 2012 and The Big House 3 in 2013. He won both the Singles and Doubles tournaments at CEO 2010 (with ChuDat in Doubles), and then again at CEO 2011 (with Linguini in Doubles). In parallel, he continued to compete on Brawl, to lesser success, and on the Brawl mod Project M, winning several minor tournaments.\n\nEarly \"Five Gods\" Era (2013–2017)\nIn 2013, Evo, the most prominent fighting game event worldwide, announced Melee as part of the Evo 2013 line-up, after the game had only previously been featured at Evo 2007. The event is considered the full beginning of the \"Era of the Five Gods\" (or \"Platinum\" Era), which marked a surge in prominence and popularity for the Melee competitive scene, and its near-total domination by five players: Hungrybox, Adam \"Armada\" Lindgren, Jason \"Mew2King\" Zimmerman, Joseph \"Mango\" Marquez, and Kevin \"PPMD\" Nanney, with every Melee tournament ranked Supermajor (the highest rating for a Smash tournament) or Major (the second-highest) for several consecutive years being won by one of the \"Gods\", and them rarely losing to anyone but another \"God\". At Evo 2013, Hungrybox finished in 3rd place, losing to Wobblez in the losers finals after a controversial finish; in parallel, he took part in a Melee Doubles Evo side-event, teaming up with Mew2King to win the tournament.\nOn July 3, 2013, Hungrybox was picked up by team CLASH Tournaments alongside fellow Super Smash Bros. player Aziz \"Hax\" Al-Yami. On April 17 of the following year, he left CLASH Tournaments and joined Team Curse. On January 6, 2015, Team Curse merged with Team Liquid, leading Hungrybox to be picked up by Team Liquid along with his teammate Kashan \"Chillin\" Khan, joining other Smash Bros. players Ken Hoang and Daniel \"KoreanDJ\" Jung.\nIn 2014, Hungrybox placed top three in nine Melee tournaments, including a victory at Fight Pitt V. At Evo 2014, he reached the Grand Finals for the first time, losing to Mango and finishing in 2nd place; he once again won the Doubles side-event, this time teaming up with Justin \"Plup\" McGrath.\nIn 2015, Hungrybox won the Melee Singles tournament at Paragon, defeating Mew2King in the Grand Finals. At Evo 2015 in July, he finished in 2nd place, losing to Armada in the Grand Finals; the following month, he announced that he would be becoming less active in competitive Smash, as he began his career as an engineer. At Paragon Los Angeles, his next tournament after Evo, he finished 3rd in Melee after being eliminated by Mew2King with a score of 2–3. In parallel to his Melee career, he competed on the newly released Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U to little success; at Paragon Los Angeles in 2015, the largest Project M tournament in history, Hungrybox finished 4th after being defeated by Mew2King 3–1.\nDreamHack Winter 2015 from November 26 to November 29, 2015, marked Hungrybox' first time winning both the Singles and Doubles tournaments at a Super Major event, winning Singles by defeating Armada 3–1 in the second set of Grand Finals after losing 3–0 in the first set, and Doubles by teaming up with Axe to defeat DaJuan \"Shroomed\" McDaniel and McCain \"MacD\" LaVelle 3–1 in the grand finals. His win in the Singles tournament earned him $10,000, his first five-figure payout; he broke into tears during his post-match interview. In early 2016, Hungrybox won two additional singles Super Major tournaments, Pound and CEO 2016.\nOn July 17, 2016, Hungrybox participated in the Evo 2016 Melee tournament and reached the Grand Finals for the third consecutive year, against Armada for a second consecutive time. In the Grand Finals, Hungrybox won two consecutive best-of-five sets, both with a score of 3–2, to win Evo for the first time in his career.\nThe following October, Hungrybox competed at The Big House 6, where he placed 5th, losing to Armada in the losers quarter-finals; although he had been juggling his entire e-sports career with full studies and/or working, Hungrybox, disappointed by his performance, decided to quit his job as process engineer for WestRock to become a full-time professional player for the first time.\n\nDomination of Melee (2017–2020)\nIn 2017, Hungrybox won multiple tournaments, including the Supermajor tournament The Big House 7, and four Super Major tournaments: Shine 2017, DreamHack Austin 2017, DreamHack Denver 2017, and Smash Summit 5; for the latter, he set a new record for most money won in a single Melee tournament, receiving $29,315.30 as prize money.\nIn 2018, Hungrybox continued to consistently rank high on tournaments, winning a total of 18, including three Supermajors: Shine 2017, CEO 2018, and The Big House 8. At Evo 2018, Hungrybox lost to Armada in the losers semifinals and ranked 4th. Hungrybox would go on to score five consecutive tournaments wins at the end of the year, including the Singles tournament at Smash Summit 7 on November 15.\nIn February 2019, Hungrybox won GENESIS 6, his first GENESIS win after participating in all five previous editions of the Singles Melee tournament. He went on to win more Majors, including Pound 2019, Low Tier City 7, CEO 2019, Shine 2019, and Mainstage.\nFollowing the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in December 2018, Hungrybox started entering Ultimate tournaments as part of events in which he was also competing as a Melee player; his Ultimate endeavors were less successful. In his first Ultimate tournament, the 385-entrant Ultimatum on December 29, he finished in 65th place. At GENESIS 6, the biggest Ultimate tournament at that point with 2105 entrants, Hungrybox placed 193rd in Singles, and 257th in Doubles with Kashan \"Chillindude\" Khan. His best Ultimate ranking for 2019 was at Mango's Birthday Bash, where he finished in 7th place; in addition, he performed as a Melee player, finishing 2nd in both singles and Doubles tournaments (teaming up with Zain for the latter).\n\nCOVID-19 and Ultimate (2020–2021)\nHungrybox won GatorLAN Spring 2020, before finishing 2nd at GENESIS 7 after losing to Zain in the Singles Grand Finals, while teaming up with him to rank 5th in Doubles. He went on to win Smash Summit 9 in February. At CEO Dreamland, he won both the Singles tournament, and the Doubles tournament with Kilmer \"mayb\" Varela.\nHe won his first Ultimate tournament by finishing 1st in The Salad Online 13's Ultimate Singles bracket.\nStarting in March 2020  the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Smash community to either cancel events or move them online. Due to Melee not having an online mode, the Melee community became de facto inactive, apart from tournaments using a fan-made online mod of Melee. Hungrybox failed to win any for the rest of the year. He achieved his worst Melee placement in 13 years in July at LACS 2, finishing 13th. The following November at Perfect Series 3: ONLINE on November 3, he finished in 17th place.\n\nReturn to in-person competition and organizer (2021–present)\nFrom July 15 to July 18, 2021, Hungrybox took part in the Melee Major tournament Smash Summit 11, the first offline Super Smash Bros. Major in North America since Frostbite in February 2020. At the end of the three-day singles tournament, he took third place, losing to Zain in the winner's finals and then to eventual tournament winner Mang0 in the loser's finals. He and Plup also took 2nd place in a special single-elimination doubles tournament where players could only pick each character once per set, losing to Mang0 and SFAT in the finals. Mang0's first-place prize in the singles tournament of $46,700 surpassed the all-time record of $29,315 Hungrybox had earned for winning Smash Summit 5 in 2017.\nAt Riptide on September 10–12, 2021, Hungrybox took third place in the singles tournament after losing to iBDW in Winners Finals and to Plup in losers finals. He and Plup also won the doubles tournament. Hungrybox and four of his fellow Team Liquid members became co-owners of the team in December.\nOn July 3, 2022, Hungrybox won Get On My Level 2022 in Canada, marking his first Singles major won in two and a half years since his last major win at Smash Summit 9 in February 2020; he would later score his second major win of that year at Riptide in September in the United States. He would ultimately be ranked 5th in the world for Melee in 2022 (the first official yearly rankings since 2019's due to COVID-2019), officially losing his rank as top player in the world and receiving his lowest Melee ranking since 2014. OrionRank (a group with rankings larger than UltRank, the main ranking entity for Ultimate, which is limited to 100 players) also ranked him the 199th Ultimate player in North America for 2022.\nOn February 16, 2025, Hungrybox won the eleventh installment of annual tournament GENESIS, which is seen as \"one of the most prestigious international tournaments in the fighting game scene.\" This was his first time winning a major since Riptide 2022.\n\nStyle and public image\nPlaystyle\nLargely credited with elevating the Melee community's perception of Jigglypuff's viability in competition and setting the standard of how to play the character, Hungrybox relies heavily on a defensive, counterattack-centric playstyle revolving around avoiding his opponent until he finds an opportunity to attack and capitalize on their mistakes; it is considered a \"high-risk high-reward\" playstyle, as Hungrybox's usual goal is to eventually hit his opponent with \"Rest\", a move unique to Jigglypuff which inflicts abnormally high knockback on opponents and is able to take the opponent's stock at much lower damage percentages than other moves of its responsiveness. The move has a very small range, making it hard to land without setting up a combo that finishes with it and, regardless of whether it successfully hits or not, it leaves Jigglypuff asleep and completely vulnerable to enemy attack for three seconds afterwards; as such, failure to hit the opponent via \"Rest\" can result in drawbacks such as massive damage inflicted on Jigglypuff via combos or, if damage is already high, in an instant kill, since Jigglypuff is the second lightest character in the game and is prone to losing stocks quickly as a result. Even if the move is successful and takes a stock, Jigglypuff might not wake up fast enough to avoid getting attacked and potentially killed in return upon her foe respawning, leaving Hungrybox little room for mistakes during a game.\nHungrybox claimed in 2013 that he \"got good using gimmicks\" and that his hands were not fast enough for technical skill. Liking Melee for its \"unorthodox value\", he claimed in 2014 that he disliked traditional head-to-head fighting games. In 2014, he stated: \"In my playstyle, I'm a greedy novel editor — I'll catch every last mistake or typo you make, and punish you harshly for it.\"\nHungrybox has earned the nickname \"Clutchbox\" due to his frequent clutch performances, pulling off comebacks when in difficult positions, particularly when in the middle of losing sets or after being sent to a losers bracket.\n\nPublic perception\nHungrybox is unanimously seen as one of the best players in Melee history, as well as the best Jigglypuff player in the game's history. However, he has remained a polarizing figure for Melee fans and players all throughout his career, with part of the community criticizing his playstyle as annoying and too slow and Jigglypuff as an unpleasing character to watch; he has also been accused of hurting the community, with some alleging that his playstyle was driving viewers away. ESPN stated in 2016: \"There is no question that Juan 'Hungrybox' Debiedma is the most polarizing figure in the realm of Super Smash Bros. Melee. Ten years deep as a competitor, he's seen fans discount him, his performances, and his character selection, some even believing that he's killing the game with each set.\" In another article in 2019, they stated that he \"has been the recipient of a significant amount of hate throughout his career.\"\nHungrybox also attracted criticism for his tendency to loudly and flashily celebrate his wins (called \"pop-offs\" within the community), which some considered disrespectful to his defeated opponents. According to Hungrybox, the Melee community's partial rejection of his playstyle started very early in his career, claiming that \"people didn't like that at all\" when he started placing high in local tournaments in 2008.\nHe has admitted to suffering from the way part of the community treats him, also stating that the community's perception of him was a factor in him starting to drink excessively in 2017 and resuming having a day job despite being the No. 1 Melee player in the world.\nIn the Grand Finals of DreamHack Austin 2017 in which he faced Daniel \"ChuDat\" Rodriguez in several highly contested games described by ESPN as \"high-level spectacle\", Hungrybox won the final game, and therefore the tournament, by camping and avoiding contact with ChuDat's Ice Climbers until the clock ran out, giving Hungrybox the win due to his statistical advantage in stocks and damage ratio.  Bleeding Cool reported the event with the headline \"DreamHack Austin Champion Wins In The Most Pathetic Way Possible\". In April 2018, Hungrybox claimed on Twitter that a stranger attracted his attention while he was shopping at Walmart earlier during the day, before saying \"Fuck you and your family Hungrybox\", as well as \"some other stuff about [him]\".\n\nControversial tournament events\nHungrybox's match against Zac \"SFAT\" Cordoni in the losers semifinals at Evo 2017 attracted controversy after Hungrybox called his coach, Luis \"Crunch\" Rosias, over for advice in between games, which was as a violation of the event's \"No Coaching After Pools\" rule; as the discussion between Hungrybox and Crunch was ongoing, Gordon \"G$\" Connell, a friend of SFAT, approached and mocked the other two by mimicking a coach-like discussion with SFAT. As the result, Evo considered that both players had violated the rule, and let the match's original result, a win for Hungrybox, stand; both players nevertheless received a yellow card as punishment for their actions. This upset part of the fans, who believed that, as SFAT was not actually being coached, he should have won by disqualification. Others pointed out that, according to the official Evo ruleset, if such an incident is not reported at the time it took place, then it is ignored, and that, as neither Hungrybox nor SFAT reported the other, neither should have been carded in the first place. Hungrybox eventually lost the following round, the losers finals, against Mango, finishing 3rd in the tournament while SFAT placed 4th as the result of his loss.\nOne of the most infamous moments in Melee history took place in April 2019 at Pound 2019, when, after Hungrybox won the Melee Singles tournament by defeating Mango in the Grand Finals, a member in the crowd, presumably upset by his win, threw a dead crab at Hungrybox, barely missing him. After a moment of incredulousness, an infuriated Hungrybox picked up the crab and shouted at the crowd, demanding to know who threw it and to \"show some respect.\", questioning if they knew how hard he works. The individual in question was later identified and ejected from the building, with a Pound official announcing that they had been permanently banned from future Pound events and that their name would be privately disclosed to other Smash tournament organizers. Hungrybox then apologized on Twitter for losing his temper, later stating: \"I was just so disappointed. I looked down and I’m like 'who threw this? Why would you throw this at me?'\", later making fun of the incident by eating a crab during a live stream. The crab incident became viral and was relayed by a variety of media outlets, quickly becoming a meme within the Smash community.\n\nPersonal life\nAfter abandoning his family and returning to Argentina in 2008, Hungrybox's father Juan Daniel passed away from a heart attack in late 2015. This was shortly before Hungrybox won both the Singles and Doubles Melee tournaments at DreamHack Winter 2015, earning his first five-figure payout and marking his first time winning both Singles and Doubles at a Super Major tournament; in a post-win interview, he broke into tears and opened about his father's lack of support. Conversely, Hungrybox credits his mother Lucia Violante for being consistently supportive since the beginning.\nHungrybox's lifelong best friend and manager is Luis \"Crunch\" Rosias, whom Hungrybox credits with training him and helping him develop his skills at Melee, most notably in how to win against Fox, who is often considered the best character in the game, and has a notoriously favorable matchup against Hungrybox's character, Jigglypuff.\nWhile competing professionally in Melee, DeBiedma continued to be a full-time student, graduating Freedom High School in 2011, and the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 2015; after getting his degree, he relocated from Jacksonville, Florida to Buford, Georgia, and then again to Demopolis, Alabama, in order to find work that could still allow him to continue his full-time Super Smash Bros. career. In 2015, he began working as a process engineer for WestRock, but quit his job the following year after underperforming at The Big House 6, in order to pursue a full-time eSports career. In March 2018, however, the decline of his mental health in 2017 following a break-up led him to take a regular job once again at ServiceNow in Florida; his feeling that the Melee community's perception of him was deteriorating also weighed heavily on him and was a factor in this decision. In June 2019, after winning CEO for the fourth time, he announced that he would be leaving the workforce to pursue eSports full-time once again. \nOn August 15, 2017, DeBiedma became a U.S. citizen.\n\nAwards and nominations\nNotable tournament placings\nOnly Majors and Supermajors are listed.\n\nMedia\nDeBiedma's early Melee career was documented in an episode of the 2013 documentary series The Smash Brothers. He also is present in another documentary about the competitive Smash scene called Metagame. Hungrybox has been a vocal advocate for the competitive Super Smash Bros. scene, praising the technological advancements created for Melee, and criticizing Nintendo for their lack of support towards the community.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nHungrybox on Twitter",

        "content": "x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.\nIn the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor's lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\n\nSoftware-based virtualization\nThe following discussion focuses only on virtualization of the x86 architecture protected mode.\nIn protected mode the operating system kernel runs at a higher privilege such as ring 0, and applications at a lower privilege such as ring 3. In software-based virtualization, a host OS has direct access to hardware while the guest OSs have limited access to hardware, just like any other application of the host OS. One approach used in x86 software-based virtualization to overcome this limitation is called ring deprivileging, which involves running the guest OS at a ring higher (lesser privileged) than 0.\nThree techniques made virtualization of protected mode possible:\n\nBinary translation is used to rewrite certain ring 0 instructions in terms of ring 3 instructions, such as POPF, that would otherwise fail silently or behave differently when executed above ring 0,: 3  making the classic trap-and-emulate virtualization impossible.: 1  To improve performance, the translated basic blocks need to be cached in a coherent way that detects code patching (used in VxDs for instance), the reuse of pages by the guest OS, or even self-modifying code.\nA number of key data structures used by a processor need to be shadowed. Because most operating systems use paged virtual memory, and granting the guest OS direct access to the MMU would mean loss of control by the virtualization manager, some of the work of the x86 MMU needs to be duplicated in software for the guest OS using a technique known as shadow page tables.: 5 : 2  This involves denying the guest OS any access to the actual page table entries by trapping access attempts and emulating them instead in software. The x86 architecture uses hidden state to store segment descriptors in the processor, so once the segment descriptors have been loaded into the processor, the memory from which they have been loaded may be overwritten and there is no way to get the descriptors back from the processor. Shadow descriptor tables must therefore be used to track changes made to the descriptor tables by the guest OS.\nI/O device emulation: Unsupported devices on the guest OS must be emulated by a device emulator that runs in the host OS.\nThese techniques incur some performance overhead due to lack of MMU virtualization support, as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370.: 10 : 17 and 21 \nOn traditional mainframes, the classic type 1 hypervisor was self-standing and did not depend on any operating system or run any user applications itself. In contrast, the first x86 virtualization products were aimed at workstation computers, and ran a guest OS inside a host OS by embedding the hypervisor in a kernel module that ran under the host OS (type 2 hypervisor).\nThere has been some controversy whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg. VMware researchers pointed out in a 2006 ASPLOS paper that the above techniques made the x86 platform virtualizable in the sense of meeting the three criteria of Popek and Goldberg, albeit not by the classic trap-and-emulate technique.: 2–3 \nA different route was taken by other systems like Denali, L4, and Xen, known as paravirtualization, which involves porting operating systems to run on the resulting virtual machine, which does not implement the parts of the actual x86 instruction set that are hard to virtualize. The paravirtualized I/O has significant performance benefits as demonstrated in the original SOSP'03 Xen paper.\nThe initial version of x86-64 (AMD64) did not allow for a software-only full virtualization due to the lack of segmentation support in long mode, which made the protection of the hypervisor's memory impossible, in particular, the protection of the trap handler that runs in the guest kernel address space.: 11 and 20  Revision D and later 64-bit AMD processors (as a rule of thumb, those manufactured in 90 nm or less) added basic support for segmentation in long mode, making it possible to run 64-bit guests in 64-bit hosts via binary translation. Intel did not add segmentation support to its x86-64 implementation (Intel 64), making 64-bit software-only virtualization impossible on Intel CPUs, but Intel VT-x support makes 64-bit hardware assisted virtualization possible on the Intel platform.: 4 \nOn some platforms, it is possible to run a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit host OS if the underlying processor is 64-bit and supports the necessary virtualization extensions.\n\nHardware-assisted virtualization\nIn 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD (working independently) created new processor extensions to the x86 architecture. The first generation of x86 hardware virtualization addressed the issue of privileged instructions. The issue of low performance of virtualized system memory was addressed with MMU virtualization that was added to the chipset later.\n\nCentral processing unit\nVirtual 8086 mode\nBecause the Intel 80286 could not run concurrent DOS applications well by itself in protected mode, Intel introduced the virtual 8086 mode in their 80386 chip, which offered virtualized 8086 processors on the 386 and later chips. Hardware support for virtualizing the protected mode itself, however, became available 20 years later.\n\nAMD virtualization (AMD-V)\nAMD developed its first generation virtualization extensions under the code name \"Pacifica\", and initially published them as AMD Secure Virtual Machine (SVM), but later marketed them under the trademark AMD Virtualization, abbreviated AMD-V.\nOn May 23, 2006, AMD released the Athlon 64 (\"Orleans\"), the Athlon 64 X2 (\"Windsor\") and the Athlon 64 FX (\"Windsor\") as the first AMD processors to support this technology.\nAMD-V capability also features on the Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 X2 family of processors with revisions \"F\" or \"G\" on socket AM2, Turion 64 X2, and Opteron 2nd generation and third-generation, Phenom and Phenom II processors. The APU Fusion processors support AMD-V. AMD-V is not supported by any Socket 939 processors. The only Sempron processors which support it are APUs and Huron, Regor, Sargas desktop CPUs.\nAMD Opteron CPUs beginning with the Family 0x10 Barcelona line, and Phenom II CPUs, support a second generation hardware virtualization technology called Rapid Virtualization Indexing (formerly known as Nested Page Tables during its development), later adopted by Intel as Extended Page Tables (EPT).\nAs of 2019, all Zen-based AMD processors support AMD-V.\nThe CPU flag for AMD-V is \"svm\". This may be checked in BSD derivatives via dmesg or sysctl and in Linux via /proc/cpuinfo. Instructions in AMD-V include VMRUN, VMLOAD, VMSAVE, CLGI, VMMCALL, INVLPGA, SKINIT, and STGI.\nWith some motherboards, users must enable AMD SVM feature in the BIOS setup before applications can make use of it.\n\nIntel virtualization (VT-x)\nPreviously codenamed \"Vanderpool\", VT-x represents Intel's technology for virtualization on the x86 platform. On November 14, 2005, Intel released two models of Pentium 4 (Model 662 and 672) as the first Intel processors to support VT-x. The CPU flag for VT-x capability is \"vmx\"; in Linux, this can be checked via /proc/cpuinfo, or in macOS via sysctl machdep.cpu.features.\n\"VMX\" stands for Virtual Machine Extensions, which adds 13 new instructions: VMPTRLD, VMPTRST, VMCLEAR, VMREAD, VMWRITE, VMCALL, VMLAUNCH, VMRESUME, VMXOFF, VMXON, INVEPT, INVVPID, and VMFUNC. These instructions permit entering and exiting a virtual execution mode where the guest OS perceives itself as running with full privilege (ring 0), but the host OS remains protected.\nAs of 2015, almost all newer server, desktop and mobile Intel processors support VT-x, with some of the Intel Atom processors as the primary exception. With some motherboards, users must enable Intel's VT-x feature in the BIOS setup before applications can make use of it.\nIntel started to include Extended Page Tables (EPT), a technology for page-table virtualization, since the Nehalem architecture, released in 2008. In 2010, Westmere added support for launching the logical processor directly in real mode –  a feature called \"unrestricted guest\", which requires EPT to work.\nSince the Haswell microarchitecture (announced in 2013), Intel started to include VMCS shadowing as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization of VMMs.\nThe virtual machine control structure (VMCS) is a data structure in memory that exists exactly once per VM, while it is managed by the VMM. With every change of the execution context between different VMs, the VMCS is restored for the current VM, defining the state of the VM's virtual processor. As soon as more than one VMM or nested VMMs are used, a problem appears in a way similar to what required shadow page table management to be invented, as described above. In such cases, VMCS needs to be shadowed multiple times (in case of nesting) and partially implemented in software in case there is no hardware support by the processor. To make shadow VMCS handling more efficient, Intel implemented hardware support for VMCS shadowing.\n\nVIA virtualization (VIA VT)\nVIA Nano 3000 Series Processors and higher support VIA VT virtualization technology compatible with Intel VT-x. EPT is present in Zhaoxin ZX-C, a descendant of VIA QuadCore-E & Eden X4 similar to Nano C4350AL.\n\nInterrupt virtualization (AMD AVIC and Intel APICv)\nIn 2012, AMD announced their Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller (AVIC) targeting interrupt overhead reduction in virtualization environments. This technology, as announced, does not support x2APIC.\nIn 2016, AVIC is available on the AMD family 15h models 6Xh\n(Carrizo) processors and newer.\nAlso in 2012, Intel announced a similar technology for interrupt and APIC virtualization, which did not have a brand name at its announcement time.\nLater, it was branded as APIC virtualization (APICv)\nand it became commercially available in the Ivy Bridge EP series of Intel CPUs, which is sold as Xeon E5-26xx v2 (launched in late 2013) and as Xeon E5-46xx v2 (launched in early 2014).\n\nGraphics processing unit\nGraphics virtualization is not part of the x86 architecture. Intel Graphics Virtualization Technology (GVT) provides graphics virtualization as part of more recent Gen graphics architectures. Although AMD APUs implement the x86-64 instruction set, they implement AMD's own graphics architectures (TeraScale, GCN and RDNA) which do not support graphics virtualization. Larrabee was the only graphics microarchitecture based on x86, but it likely did not include support for graphics virtualization.\n\nChipset\nMemory and I/O virtualization is performed by the chipset. Typically these features must be enabled by the BIOS, which must be able to support them and also be set to use them.\n\nI/O MMU virtualization (AMD-Vi and Intel VT-d)\nAn input/output memory management unit (IOMMU) allows guest virtual machines to directly use peripheral devices, such as Ethernet, accelerated graphics cards, and hard-drive controllers, through DMA and interrupt remapping. This is sometimes called PCI passthrough.\nAn IOMMU also allows operating systems to eliminate bounce buffers needed to allow themselves to communicate with peripheral devices whose memory address spaces are smaller than the operating system's memory address space, by using memory address translation. At the same time, an IOMMU also allows operating systems and hypervisors to prevent buggy or malicious hardware from compromising memory security.\nBoth AMD and Intel have released their IOMMU specifications:\n\nAMD's I/O Virtualization Technology, \"AMD-Vi\", originally called \"IOMMU\"\nIntel's \"Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O\" (VT-d), included in most high-end (but not all) newer Intel processors since the Core 2 architecture.\nIn addition to the CPU support, both motherboard chipset and system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) need to fully support the IOMMU I/O virtualization functionality for it to be usable. Only the PCI or PCI Express devices supporting function level reset (FLR) can be virtualized this way, as it is required for reassigning various device functions between virtual machines.  If a device to be assigned does not support Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI), it must not share interrupt lines with other devices for the assignment to be possible.\nAll conventional PCI devices routed behind a PCI/PCI-X-to-PCI Express bridge can be assigned to a guest virtual machine only all at once; PCI Express devices have no such restriction.\n\nNetwork virtualization (VT-c)\nIntel's \"Virtualization Technology for Connectivity\" (VT-c).\n\nPCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)\nPCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) provides a set of general (non-x86 specific) I/O virtualization methods based on PCI Express (PCIe) native hardware, as standardized by PCI-SIG:\n\nAddress translation services (ATS) supports native IOV across PCI Express via address translation. It requires support for new transactions to configure such translations.\nSingle-root IOV (SR-IOV or SRIOV) supports native IOV in existing single-root complex PCI Express topologies. It requires support for new device capabilities to configure multiple virtualized configuration spaces.\nMulti-root IOV (MR-IOV) supports native IOV in new topologies (for example, blade servers) by building on SR-IOV to provide multiple root complexes which share a common PCI Express hierarchy.\nIn SR-IOV, the most common of these, a host VMM configures supported devices to create and allocate virtual \"shadows\" of their configuration spaces so that virtual machine guests can directly configure and access such \"shadow\" device resources. With SR-IOV enabled, virtualized network interfaces are directly accessible to the guests,\navoiding involvement of the VMM and resulting in high overall performance; for example, SR-IOV achieves over 95% of the bare metal network bandwidth in NASA's virtualized datacenter and in the Amazon Public Cloud.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nEverything You Need to Know About the Intel Virtualization Technology Archived at ghostarchive.org at 10 May 2022\nA special course at the University of San Francisco on Intel EM64T and VT Extensions (2007)\n2 day open source & open access class on writing a VT-x VMM",

        "streamer": "VIPER",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper",
        "content": "Vipers are snakes in the family Viperidae, found in most parts of the world, except for Antarctica, Australia, Hawaii, Madagascar, New Zealand, Ireland, and various other isolated islands. They are venomous and have long (relative to non-vipers), hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of their venom. Three subfamilies are currently recognized. They are also known as viperids. The name \"viper\" is derived from the Latin word vipera, -ae, also meaning viper, possibly from vivus (\"living\") and parere (\"to beget\"), referring to the trait viviparity (giving live birth) common in vipers like most of the species of Boidae.\n\nDescription\nAll viperids have a pair of relatively long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is at the front of the mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. This rotating mechanism allows for very long fangs to be contained in a relatively small mouth. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Pre-digestion occurs as the venom contains proteases, which degrade tissues. Secondarily, it is used for self defense, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve its precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, time is needed to replenish it, leaving the snake vulnerable. In addition to being able to deliver dry bites, vipers can inject larger quantities of venom into larger prey targets, and smaller amounts into small prey. This causes the ideal amount of predigestion for the lowest amount of venom.\nAlmost all vipers have keeled scales, a stocky build with a short tail, and a triangle-shaped head distinct from the neck, owing to the location of the venom glands. The great majority have vertically elliptical, or slit-shaped, pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to see in a wide range of light levels. Typically, vipers are nocturnal and ambush their prey.\n\nCompared to many other snakes, vipers often appear rather sluggish. Most are ovoviviparous: the eggs are retained inside the mother's body, and the young emerge living. However, a few lay eggs in nests. Typically, the number of young in a clutch remains constant, but as the weight of the mother increases, larger eggs are produced, yielding larger young.\n\nGeographic range\nViperid snakes are found in the Americas, Africa, Eurasia, and South Asia. In the Americas, they are native from south of 48°N. In the Old World, viperids are located everywhere except Siberia, Ireland, and north of the Arctic Circle in Norway and Sweden. Wild viperids are not found in Australia. The common adder, a viperid, is the only venomous snake found in Great Britain.\n\nVenom\nViperid venoms typically contain an abundance of protein-degrading enzymes, called proteases, that produce symptoms such as pain, strong local swelling and necrosis, blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated by coagulopathy, and disruption of the blood-clotting system. Also being vasculotoxic in nature, viperine venom causes vascular endothelial damage and hemolysis. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure. This is in contrast to elapid venoms, which generally contain neurotoxins that disable muscle contraction and cause paralysis. Death from elapid bites usually results from asphyxiation because the diaphragm can no longer contract, but this rule does not always apply; some elapid bites include proteolytic symptoms typical of viperid bites, while some viperid bites produce neurotoxic symptoms.\nProteolytic venom is also dual-purpose: first, it is used for defense and to immobilize prey, as with neurotoxic venoms; second, many of the venom's enzymes have a digestive function, breaking down molecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. This is an important adaptation, as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems.\nDue to the nature of proteolytic venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated. A victim's fate is impossible to predict, as this depends on many factors, including the species and size of the snake involved, how much venom was injected (if any), and the size and condition of the patient before being bitten. Viper bite victims may also be allergic to the venom or the antivenom.\n\nBehavior\nThese snakes can decide how much venom to inject depending on the circumstances. The most important determinant of venom expenditure is generally the size of the snake; larger specimens can deliver much more venom. The species is also important, since some are likely to inject more venom than others, may have more venom available, strike more accurately, or deliver a number of bites in a short time. In predatory bites, factors that influence the amount of venom injected include the size of the prey, the species of prey, and whether the prey item is held or released. The need to label prey for chemosensory relocation after a bite and release may also play a role. In defensive bites, the amount of venom injected may be determined by the size or species of the predator (or antagonist), as well as the assessed level of threat, although larger assailants and higher threat levels may not necessarily lead to larger amounts of venom being injected.\n\nPrey tracking\nHemotoxic venom takes more time than neurotoxic venom to immobilize prey, so viperid snakes need to track down prey animals after they have been bitten, in a process known as \"prey relocalization\". Vipers are able to do this via certain proteins contained in their venom. This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals. This adaptation, then, requires the snake to track down the bitten animal to eat it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. Western diamondback rattlesnakes respond more actively to mouse carcasses that have been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of disintegrins, which are responsible for allowing the snakes to track down their prey.\n\nSubfamilies\nType genus = Vipera Laurenti, 1768\n\nSensory organs\nHeat-sensing pits\nPit vipers have specialized sensory organs near the nostrils called heat-sensing pits. The location of this organ is unique to pit vipers. These pits have the ability to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded animals, helping them better understand their environment. Internally the organ forms a small pit lined with membranes, external and internal, attached to the trigeminal nerve. Infrared light signals the internal membranes, which in turn signal the trigeminal nerve and send the infrared signals to the brain, where they are overlaid onto the visual image created by the eyes.\n\nTaxonomy\nWhether family Viperidae is attributed to Oppel (1811), as opposed to Laurenti (1768) or Gray (1825), is subject to some interpretation. The consensus among leading experts, though, is that Laurenti used viperae as the plural of vipera (Latin for \"viper\", \"adder\", or \"snake\") and did not intend for it to indicate a family group taxon. Rather, it is attributed to Oppel, based on his Viperini as a distinct family group name, despite the fact that Gray was the first to use the form Viperinae.\n\nSee also\nList of snakes, overview of all snake families and genera\nSnakebite\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nViperidae at the Reptarium.cz Reptile Database.

        "content": "A tray is a shallow platform designed for the carrying of items. It can be fashioned from numerous materials, including silver, brass, sheet iron, paperboard, wood, melamine, and molded pulp. Trays range in cost from inexpensive molded pulp trays which are disposable and inexpensive melamine trays used in cafeterias, to mid-priced wooden trays used in a home, to expensive silver trays used in luxury hotels. Some examples have raised galleries, handles, and short feet for support.\nTrays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off them. They are made in a range of shapes but are commonly found in oval or rectangular forms, sometimes with cutout or attached handles with which to carry them.\nA more elaborate device is the tray table, which is designed to accommodate a tray, or to serve as a tray itself. There are two primary kinds of tray tables. The TV tray table is typically a small table, which may have legs that fold to allow it to be carried like a tray. The airplane tray table is a tray built into the back of an airline seat, which folds down so that the person sitting in the seat behind the one containing the table can use it as a surface from which to eat meals served on the airplane.\n\nExamples\nA butler's tray often has a gallery, or deeper surround, handles on the long sides to facilitate carrying (usually cut into the surround), and a portable stand with folding legs. It is used for the service of drinks and generally serves as a convenient side table.\nA cafeteria tray is used for carrying items in a cafeteria. It is typically made of plastic or fiberglass. A compartment tray or mess tray is a cafeteria tray designed to be used directly, without dishes - it incorporates shallow compartments in which different types of food are placed.\nA cargo tray, the rear of a ute, used to hold goods.\nA molded pulp tray is a disposable (or recyclable) tray provided by fast food restaurants, coffee shops and movie theaters. The tray is designed to hold four disposable cups.\nSurgical trays are used to carry surgical instruments, are rectangular and made of stainless steel to resist the heat of sterilization without corrosion.\nSeed trays are used for propagating vegetables and flowers and other plants from seed. They are also used for taking plant cuttings. The trays for seedling production are made of expanded polystyrene or polythene. They come in many sizes; the most common are the Danish and the European sized trays. Seed trays can also be stacked in seed tray racks to take up less space.\nA darkroom tray, also known as print developing tray, is used in photography.\nA dental impression tray is a receptacle or device that is used to carry impression material to the mouth, confine the material in apposition to the surfaces to be recorded, and control the impression material while it sets to form the impression.\nA baking tray or oven tray is used to cook a variety of foods in an oven, including vegetables and meats such as whole chickens. It allows food to be very exposed to the hot air inside the oven whilst preventing any fats of liquids from falling onto the oven floor. See also Sheet pan.\nFood packaging trays\nA foam tray is used by the supermarkets and by the fruit shops to package meat and small fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. Patents for this product exist since 1966.\nAluminium foil take-out food tray used by the supermarkets for packaging processed food.\nThin plastic trays used for both packaging shelf food and for take-out food\nA coin tray is used to store or collect coins. They are used in banks, restaurants, shops, casinos, and for coin collecting.\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nGermination\nGastronorm, a European standard for food tray sizes\nLazy Susan, a rotating tray, usually circular, placed on top of a table to aid in moving food on a large table or countertop.\nPhan (tray)\nSafetray\nSalver, a diminutive tray commonly used for lighter and smaller servings\nServing cart\nThali\nTV tray table\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to trays at Wikimedia Commons\n The dictionary definition of tray at Wiktionary",

        "content": "Soap is a salt of a fatty acid (sometimes other carboxylic acids) used for cleaning and lubricating products as well as other applications. In a domestic setting, soaps, specifically \"toilet soaps\", are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping. In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, emulsifiers, and catalysts.\nSoaps are often produced by mixing fats and oils with a base. Humans have used soap for millennia; evidence exists for the production of soap-like materials in ancient Babylon around 2800 BC.\n\nTypes\nToilet soaps\nIn a domestic setting, \"soap\" usually refers to what is technically called a toilet soap, used for household and personal cleaning. Toilet soaps are salts of fatty acids with the general formula (RCO2−)M+, where M is Na (sodium) or K (potassium).\nWhen used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned. The insoluble oil/fat \"dirt\" become associated inside micelles, tiny spheres formed from soap molecules with polar hydrophilic (water-attracting) groups on the outside and encasing a lipophilic (fat-attracting) pocket, which shields the oil/fat molecules from the water, making them soluble. Anything that is soluble will be washed away with the water. In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.\nWhen used in hard water, soap does not lather well but forms soap scum (related to metallic soaps, see below).\n\nNon-toilet soaps\nSo-called metallic soaps are key components of most lubricating greases and thickeners. A commercially important example is lithium stearate. Greases are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soap and mineral oil. Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures thereof. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, lubricating greases were made by the addition of lime to olive oil, which would produce calcium soaps. Metal soaps are also included in modern artists' oil paints formulations as a rheology modifier. Metal soaps can be prepared by neutralizing fatty acids with metal oxides:\n\n2 RCO2H + CaO → (RCO2)2Ca + H2O\nA cation from an organic base such as ammonium can be used instead of a metal; ammonium nonanoate is an ammonium-based soap that is used as an herbicide.\nAnother class of non-toilet soaps are resin soaps, which are produced in the paper industry by the action of tree rosin with alkaline reagents used to separate cellulose from raw wood.  A major component of such soaps is the sodium salt of abietic acid.  Resin soaps are used as emulsifiers.\n\nSoapmaking\nThe production of toilet soaps usually entails saponification of triglycerides, which are vegetable or animal oils and fats. An alkaline solution (often lye) induces saponification whereby the triglyceride fats first hydrolyze into salts of fatty acids. Glycerol (glycerin) is liberated. The glycerin is sometimes left in the soap product as a softening agent, although it is sometimes separated. Handmade soap can differ from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat or coconut oil beyond that needed to consume the alkali is used (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called \"superfatting\"), and the glycerol left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer. The addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat, although it can leave a \"greasy\" feel. Sometimes, an emollient is added, such as jojoba oil or shea butter. Sand or pumice may be added to produce a scouring soap. The scouring agents serve to remove dead cells from the skin surface being cleaned. This process is called exfoliation.\nTo make antibacterial soap, compounds such as triclosan or triclocarban can be added. There is some concern that use of antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms.\nThe type of alkali metal used determines the kind of soap product. Sodium soaps, prepared from sodium hydroxide (soda lye), are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from potassium hydroxide (potash lye), are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted from the ashes of bracken or other plants. Lithium soaps also tend to be hard. These are used exclusively in greases.\nFor making toilet soaps, triglycerides (oils and fats) are derived from coconut, olive, or palm oils, as well as tallow. Triglyceride is the chemical name for the triesters of fatty acids and glycerin. Tallow, i.e., rendered fat, is the most available triglyceride from animals. Each species offers quite different fatty acid content, resulting in soaps of distinct feel. The seed oils give softer but milder soaps. Soap made from pure olive oil, sometimes called Castile soap or Marseille soap, is reputed for its particular mildness. The term \"Castile\" is also sometimes applied to soaps from a mixture of oils with a high percentage of olive oil.\n\nGallery\nHistory\nProto-soaps in the Ancient world\nProto-soaps, which mixed fat and alkali and were used for cleansing, are mentioned in Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptian texts.\nThe earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in ancient Babylon. A formula for making a soap-like substance was written on a Sumerian clay tablet around 2500 BC. This was produced by heating a mixture of oil and wood ash, the earliest recorded chemical reaction, and used for washing woolen clothing.\nThe Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC) indicates the ancient Egyptians used a soap-like product as a medicine and created this by combining animal fats or vegetable oils with a soda ash substance called trona. Egyptian documents mention a similar substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving.\nIn the reign of Nabonidus (556–539 BC), a recipe for a soap-like substance consisted of uhulu [ashes], cypress [oil] and sesame [seed oil] \"for washing the stones for the servant girls\".\n\nTrue soaps in the Ancient world\nTrue soaps, which we might recognise as soaps today, were different to proto-soaps. They foamed, were made deliberately, and could be produced in a hard or soft form because of an understanding of lye sources. It is uncertain as to who was the first to invent true soap.\nKnowledge of how to produce true soap emerged at some point between early mentions of proto-soaps and the first century AD. Alkali was used to clean textiles such as wool for thousands of years but soap only forms when there is enough fat, and experiments show that washing wool does not create visible quantities of soap. Experiments by Sally Pointer show that the repeated laundering of materials used in perfume-making lead to noticeable amounts of soap forming. This fits with other evidence from Mesopotamian culture.\nPliny the Elder, whose writings chronicle life in the first century AD, describes soap as \"an invention of the Gauls\". The word sapo, Latin for soap, has  connected to a mythical Mount Sapo, a hill near the River Tiber where animals were sacrificed. But in all likelihood, the word was borrowed from an early Germanic language and is cognate with Latin sebum, \"tallow\". It first appears in Pliny the Elder's account, Historia Naturalis, which discusses the manufacture of soap from tallow and ashes. There he mentions its use in the treatment of scrofulous sores, as well as among the Gauls as a dye to redden hair which the men in Germania were more likely to use than women. The Romans avoided washing with harsh soaps before encountering the milder soaps used by the Gauls around 58 BC. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, writing in the 2nd century AD, observes among \"Celts, which are men called Gauls, those alkaline substances that are made into balls [...] called soap\". The Romans' preferred method of cleaning the body was to massage oil into the skin and then scrape away both the oil and any dirt with a strigil. The standard design is a curved blade with a handle, all of which is made of metal.\nThe 2nd-century AD physician Galen describes soap-making using lye and prescribes washing to carry away impurities from the body and clothes. The use of soap for personal cleanliness became increasingly common in this period. According to Galen, the best soaps were Germanic, and soaps from Gaul were second best. Zosimos of Panopolis, circa 300 AD, describes soap and soapmaking.\nIn the Southern Levant, the ashes from barilla plants, such as species of Salsola, saltwort (Seidlitzia rosmarinus) and Anabasis, were used to make potash. Traditionally, olive oil was used instead of animal lard throughout the Levant, which was boiled in a copper cauldron for several days. As the boiling progresses, alkali ashes and smaller quantities of quicklime are added and constantly stirred. In the case of lard, it required constant stirring while kept lukewarm until it began to trace. Once it began to thicken, the brew was poured into a mold and left to cool and harden for two weeks. After hardening, it was cut into smaller cakes. Aromatic herbs were often added to the rendered soap to impart their fragrance, such as yarrow leaves, lavender, germander, etc.\n\nAncient China\nA detergent similar to soap was manufactured in ancient China from the seeds of Gleditsia sinensis. Another traditional detergent is a mixture of pig pancreas and plant ash called zhuyizi (simplified Chinese: 猪胰子; traditional Chinese: 豬胰子; pinyin: zhūyízǐ). Soap made of animal fat did not appear in China until the modern era. Soap-like detergents were not as popular as ointments and creams.\n\nIslamic Golden Age\nHard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was produced in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (c. 865–925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria to other parts of the Muslim world and to Europe.\nA 12th-century document describes the process of soap production. It mentions the key ingredient, alkali, which later became crucial to modern chemistry, derived from al-qaly or \"ashes\".\nBy the 13th century, the manufacture of soap in the Middle East had become a major cottage industry, with sources in Nablus, Fes, Damascus, and Aleppo.\n\nMedieval Europe\nSoapmakers in Naples were members of a guild in the late sixth century (then under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire), and in the eighth century, soap-making was well known in Italy and Spain. The Carolingian capitulary De Villis, dating to around 800, representing the royal will of Charlemagne, mentions soap as being one of the products the stewards of royal estates are to tally. The lands of Medieval Spain were a leading soapmaker by 800, and soapmaking began in the Kingdom of England about 1200. Soapmaking is mentioned both as \"women's work\" and as the produce of \"good workmen\" alongside other necessities, such as the produce of carpenters, blacksmiths, and bakers.\nIn Europe, soap in the 9th century was produced from animal fats and had an unpleasant smell. This changed when olive oil began to be used in soap formulas instead, after which much of Europe's soap production moved to the Mediterranean olive-growing regions. Hard toilet soap was introduced to Europe by Arabs and gradually spread as a luxury item. It was often perfumed.\nBy the 15th century, the manufacture of soap in Christendom often took place on an industrial scale, with sources in Antwerp, Castile, Marseille, Naples and Venice.\n\n16th–17th century\nIn France, by the second half of the 16th century, the semi-industrialized professional manufacture of soap was concentrated in a few centers of Provence—Toulon, Hyères, and Marseille—which supplied the rest of France. In Marseilles, by 1525, production was concentrated in at least two factories, and soap production at Marseille tended to eclipse the other Provençal centers.\nEnglish manufacture tended to concentrate in London. The demand for high-quality hard soap was significant enough during the Tudor period that barrels of ashes were imported for the manufacture of soap.\nFiner soaps were later produced in Europe from the 17th century, using vegetable oils (such as olive oil) as opposed to animal fats. Many of these soaps are still produced, both industrially and by small-scale artisans. Castile soap is a popular example of the vegetable-only soaps derived from the oldest \"white soap\" of Italy. In 1634 Charles I granted the newly formed Society of Soapmakers a monopoly in soap production who produced certificates from 'foure Countesses, and five Viscountesses, and divers other Ladies and Gentlewomen of great credite and quality, besides common Laundresses and others', testifying that 'the New White Soap washeth whiter and sweeter than the Old Soap'.\nDuring the Restoration era (February 1665 – August 1714) a soap tax was introduced in England, which meant that until the mid-1800s, soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. The soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure that soapmakers' equipment was kept under lock and key when not being supervised. Moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law that stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each boiling, which placed the process beyond the reach of the average person. The soap trade was boosted and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.\n\nModern period\nIndustrially manufactured bar soaps became available in the late 18th century, as advertising campaigns in Europe and America promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health. In modern times, the use of soap has become commonplace in industrialized nations due to a better understanding of the role of hygiene in reducing the population size of pathogenic microorganisms.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nUntil the Industrial Revolution, soapmaking was conducted on a small scale and the product was rough. In 1780, James Keir established a chemical works at Tipton, for the manufacture of alkali from the sulfates of potash and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. In 1790, Nicolas Leblanc discovered how to make alkali from common salt. Andrew Pears started making a high-quality, transparent soap, Pears soap, in 1807 in London. His son-in-law, Thomas J. Barratt, became the brand manager (the first of its kind) for Pears in 1865. In 1882, Barratt recruited English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster-girl for Pears soap, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.\nWilliam Gossage produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. Robert Spear Hudson began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with a mortar and pestle. American manufacturer Benjamin T. Babbitt introduced marketing innovations that included the sale of bar soap and distribution of product samples. William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns.\n\nLiquid soap\nLiquid soap was invented in the nineteenth century; in 1865, William Sheppard patented a liquid version of soap. In 1898, B.J. Johnson developed a soap derived from palm and olive oils; his company, the B.J. Johnson Soap Company, introduced \"Palmolive\" brand soap that same year. This new brand of soap became popular rapidly, and to such a degree that B.J. Johnson Soap Company changed its name to Palmolive.\nIn the early 1900s, other companies began to develop their own liquid soaps. Such products as Pine-Sol and Tide appeared on the market, making the process of cleaning things other than skin, such as clothing, floors, and bathrooms, much easier.\nLiquid soap also works better for more traditional or non-machine washing methods, such as using a washboard.\n\nSee also\nSoap-related\nReferences\nFurther reading\nKunatsa, Yvonne; Katerere, David R.

        "content": "Olof Kajbjer Gustafsson (born 31 January 1992), better known as olofmeister, is a Swedish professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player for FaZe Clan. He has previously played for H2k, Absolute Legends, LGB eSports, Fnatic, and FaZe Clan. Gustafsson is widely regarded as one of the best CS:GO players in history. He has won two CSGO Majors, ESL One Katowice 2015 and ESL One Cologne 2015, as well as many other tournaments.\n\nEarly life\nGustafsson grew up in Tyresö. He has a brother, Karl, and a sister, Hanna. He developed an interest in playing football at the young age of four and remained active in the sport until he sustained a knee injury at the age of fifteen. He is an avid fan of Arsenal. The injury eventually became a catalyst for his transition from playing Counter-Strike casually, into taking it more seriously.\n\nCareer\nH2k\nIn H2k, Gustafsson played with Joel \"emilio\" Mako, André \"keiz\" Carlsson, John \"wenton\" Eriksson, and Hugo \"huggan\" Lopez.\n\nAbsolute Legends\nGustafsson quietly began his Counter-Strike: Global Offensive career in Absolute Legends and H2k without garnering much attention. The roster had their most successful run at EMS One Katowice 2014 where they placed 3rd-4th after losing 1:2 to Virtus Pro. In Absolute Legends, Gustafsson played with Andreas \"schneider\" Lindberg, Markus \"pronax\" Wallsten, Dennis \"dennis\" Edman, and Alexander \"rdl\" Redl. Following the teams break up in 2013, Andreas \"schneider\" Lindberg and Markus \"pronax\" Wallsten eventually joined Fnatic, the team Gustafsson later joined in 2014, then replacing Andreas \"schneider\" Lindberg.\n\nLGB eSports\nIt was not until he joined LGB eSports in June 2013 where he began to rise to prominence. In LGB eSports, Gustafsson played with his former Fnatic teammates Dennis \"dennis\" Edman and Freddy \"KRIMZ\" Johansson, as well as Simon \"twist\" Eliasson and Isak \"cype\" Rydman.\n\nFnatic\n2014\nAlong with his teammate Freddy \"KRIMZ\" Johansson, Gustafsson left LGB and joined fnatic in June. There, he found immediate success, helping his team to a second-place finish at the ESL One Cologne 2014 Major Championship. During one of the games in this tournament against Team Dignitas, on the map Overpass, he gained widespread attention by defusing the bomb milliseconds before a Molotov could kill him, securing match point. Subsequently, commemorative graffiti  was added on the map and a weapon skin to Glock-18 (Glock-18 | Sacrifice in CS20 case) was added in the game. In the months following, Fnatic saw tremendous success, and were favorites going into DreamHack Winter 2014, the following Major Championship. After advancing from a second-place finish in their group, Fnatic were seeded against rivals Team LDLC in the quarter-final. During the match, Gustafsson became the center of controversy when he was boosted by his teammates into an, unbeknownst to him, illegal position which allowed his team to comeback from a nine-round deficit and win the match. After LDLC filed a complaint against them which ruled that the match had to be replayed, Fnatic filed a counter complaint, pointing out that LDLC had used a similar position in the first half. The tournament organiser ruled that the entire map should be replayed, however Fnatic forfeited the game and withdrew from the tournament. The incident became infamous in the CS:GO community where Gustafsson and the map Overpass were nicknamed \"Boostmeister\" and \"Olofpass\" respectively.\nFollowing the event, Gustafsson considered leaving Fnatic and the game all together, but wound up staying after a successful run at the ESEA Invite Season 17 Global Finals.\n\n2015\nIn February, Fnatic won the IOS Pantamera tournament after beating Titan in the finals. In March, Fnatic won ESL One Katowice 2015, the first Major Championship of the year. In August, Fnatic became the first team to win two consecutive Major Championships in a row, as they were crowned champions of ESL One Cologne 2015. At DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca 2015, the third Major Championship of the year, Fnatic finished 5-8th.\nAfter Markus \"pronax\" Wallsten left Fnatic on the 12 November 2015, they recruited Gustafsson's long-time friend and former teammate Dennis \"dennis\" Edman. The team proceeded to win all three remaining tournaments of the year: FACEIT DreamHack Winter 2015, Fragbite Masters Season 5, and ESL ESEA Pro League Season II - Finals.\nGustafsson was widely regarded as the best Counter-Strike player of 2015.\n\n2016\nIn January, Gustafsson and his team won the SLTV Starseries XIV over Natus Vincere. On 5 March, Gustafsson and Fnatic won the IEM Katowice World Championship 2016, beating Luminosity Gaming 3–0 in the finals. Fnatic placed 5–8th at the MLG Major Championship: Columbus in April. Shortly thereafter on 8 April, it was announced that Gustafsson would be taking a break from competitive play due to a repetitive strain injury of a hand and would be temporarily replaced by Niclas \"Plessen\" Plessen; whom was shortly replaced by John \"wenton\" Eriksson.\n\nFaZe Clan\nOn 20 August 2017, Gustafsson officially signed with FaZe Clan, ending his 3-year tenure with Fnatic. Since joining the team, Gustafsson temporarily left the team for personal reasons, requiring the team to use stand-ins 'Xizt', a Swedish coach/analyst for NiP, and 'Cromen', a Norwegian player who is currently inactive. On 25 May 2018, FaZe announced Gustafsson's return to the team, but after a short while, it was confirmed that Gustafsson was 'not ready' to play. Since then, Gustafsson made his return to competitive play on 10 July. Gustafsson again stepped away from competitive play on 23 May 2020. However, he returned to FaZe Clan as a stand-in in October.\nSince joining FaZe Clan, he has won 10 events including: ESL One: New York 2017, Epicenter 2018 and Blast Pro Series Copenhagen 2019, yet he has not won a major playing with FaZe Clan. He reached the grand final of ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018, but they were defeated by Cloud9 in the finals.\nIn May 2020, Gustafsson announced that he will take an indefinite break from Counter-Strike and FaZe Clan, citing in a statement that he had become \"increasingly fatigued\" and \"losing [...] motivation\". On 28 October, Gustafsson returned to FaZe Clan's starting lineup as a stand-in, upon the departure of Nikola \"NiKo\" Kovač. Following the departure of Coldzera, Olofmeister returned to the active roster on June 14 as a permanent member.\n\nBibliography\nCS:GO Player Profiles - olofmeister - Fnatic. Perf.

        "content": "William Li (born November 25, 1989), better known as Scarra, is an American Twitch streamer and former professional League of Legends player. He is most well known for being the mid laner for Team Dignitas. Li is a co-founder of OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group of content creators.\n\nEarly life\nLi has a family and an older brother named David. He got all A's in middle school. He had a stuttering problem growing up, so his parents forced him to join a debate club in high school.\nHe attended Texas A&M University  but dropped out in 2012 to pursue a professional gaming career.\n\nCareer\nLeague of Legends\nSeason 1\nLi started playing League of Legends after its official release. He started to get attention from Locust, which he knew from World of Warcraft. He, Rambo, Th3Rat, Naryt, Voyboy, and Araragi together created a team to compete in the 2010 Newegg Winter Winfest tournament but lost the tournament.\nLi signed with Team Dignitas prior to the start of the inaugural League of Legends Championship Series season.\nOn October 9, 2011, Li and his team defeated Epik Gamer 2-1 in the IGN Proleague Season 3 - Atlantic City.\nLi was able to place third in the IEM Season VI - Global Challenge Kyiv but was defeated in the semifinals.\nAt the LoLPro.com Curse Invitational in San Francisco, Scarra and Team Dignitas took home the grand prize of $20,000.\nLi attended the IEM Season VI - World Championship in Hanover.\n\nSeason 2\nWhile on the way back to the United States, Li attended IGN Proleague Season 4 - Las Vegas on April 6, 2012. His team was able to defeat Monomaniac 2-1 and Counter Logic Gaming Prime 2-1 in the second round. Team Dignitas fell short 2–1 against Team SoloMid and were ultimately eliminated by Counter Logic Gaming Prime 2–0.\nOn June 6, 2012, Li attended the MLG Pro Circuit - Spring Championship with a newly reformed Dignitas, having Voyboy replaced by Crumbzz. Scarra and Team Dignitas defeated Team Green Forest, Team Dynamic, and Counter Logic Gaming Prime. They lost to Team SoloMid, which they encountered Counter Logic Gaming Prime and lost 2–0, taking home third place.\nLi and Team Dignitas participated in the 2012 MLG Summer Championship. They originally finished in second place in the tournament but would later be disqualified after MLG determined that there was collusion between Dignitas and the first-place team, Curse NA. At the Season Two North American Regionals, they also finished second, losing to Team SoloMid in the finals.\n\nSeason 3\nLi and his team attended the Season 3 League Championship Series. They finished in third place.\nThe Season 3 LCS Spring Playoffs took place in April, and Li and his team were sent to relegation at the Season 3 LCS Summer Promotion. Team Dignitas was able to defeat Team Summon 3-1 and secure their spot in the summer season.\nHis team also competed in the 2013 MLG Winter Championship. They went against Gambit Gaming but lost 2–0.\n\nIn April 2013, Li was publicly voted as the NA LCS mid-lane All-Star, which allowed him to play for the North America LCS team and compete in All-Star Shanghai 2013. They lost against China LPL, 2–0. They went on to win against the Europe LCS by 2–0. After winning against Europe LCS, they went on to play against the Korean OGN Champions and lost 2–0.\n\nSeason 4\nOn December 10, CLG was fined $10,000 by Riot for poaching Li from Dignitas. Additionally, Scarra would be banned from serving the position of being CLG's head coach for the first three weeks of the spring LCS. Scarra played for CLG Black in the summer season qualifier, but after defeating Maelstrom, they were forced to substituted out AD carry Stixxay for Frost and then lost to both Cloud9 Tempest and Magnetic, missing out on the NACS summer season.\n\nReturn to Twitch & OfflineTV\nFollowing his retirement from the League of Legends Championship series, Li made his return to Twitch as a full-time content creator. In June 2017, Li joined Echo Fox's League of Legends Challenger Series team, Delta Fox, as a midlaner. He would leave two months later, joining the Meme Stream Dream Team, a team formed by Delta Fox's former roster. The Dream Team played in three exhibition tournaments: The Tyler1 Championship Series in 2017 and 2018, along with a \"showmatch\" at the 2018 NA LCS finals.\nIn July 2017, he and his then-manager, Chris Chan, founded OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group based in Los Angeles, California. Speaking on the origins of the group, Li stated \"I think I just wanted to live with friends. That was the origin of it. I wanted to live with people and make cool stuff with other people. It was myself and my manager Chris who started this idea. It just led to where it is today. I can’t say that there was a formula we followed. We faced a lot of problems along the way. However, thanks to these problems, I feel like we came out stronger.\nIn 2019, Li was one of the most watched Teamfight Tactics streamers following the game's release in June, averaging 7,000 viewers. He also completed a streaming challenge where he streamed every day for the entire year.\nIn 2021, Li debuted a dragon VTuber model based on Choncc from Teamfight Tactics. His character experienced an isekai woken up in a fantasy world.\nIn 2022, Li debuted his new VTuber model, an evolved evil version of his original model. His character underwent a transformation after tragic incidents in the fantasy world.\nIn 2024, he disclosed in the OFFLINETV 30 DAY FITNESS CHALLENGE video that he is officially diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nSelect competitions\nLeague of Legends\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nImaqtpie\nDisguised Toast\nPokimane\n\nReferences\n\n Text was copied from scarra at GamePedia, which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.",

        "content": "A bean is the seed of any plant in the legume family (Fabaceae) used as a vegetable for human consumption or animal feed. The seeds are often preserved through drying, but fresh beans are also sold. Most beans are traditionally soaked and boiled, but they can be cooked in many different ways, including frying and baking, and are used in many traditional dishes throughout the world.  The unripe seedpods of some varieties are also eaten whole as green beans or edamame (immature soybean), but fully ripened beans contain toxins like phytohemagglutinin and require cooking.\n\nTerminology\nThe word 'bean', for the Old World vegetable, existed in Old English, long before the New World genus Phaseolus was known in Europe.  With the Columbian exchange of domestic plants between Europe and the Americas, use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of Phaseolus, such as the common bean and the runner bean, and the related genus Vigna. The term has long been applied generally to seeds of similar form, such as Old World soybeans and lupins, and to the fruits or seeds of unrelated plants such as coffee beans, vanilla beans, castor beans, and cocoa beans.\n\nHistory\nBeans in an early cultivated form were grown in Thailand from the early seventh millennium BCE, predating ceramics. Beans were deposited with the dead in ancient Egypt. Not until the second millennium BCE did cultivated, large-seeded broad beans appear in the Aegean region, Iberia, and transalpine Europe. In the Iliad (8th century BCE), there is a passing mention of beans and chickpeas cast on the threshing floor.\nThe oldest-known domesticated beans in the Americas were found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru, dated to around the second millennium BCE. Genetic analyses of the common bean Phaseolus show that it originated in Mesoamerica, and subsequently spread southward, along with maize and squash, traditional companion crops.\nMost of the kinds of beans commonly eaten today are part of the genus Phaseolus, which originated in the Americas. The first European to encounter them was Christopher Columbus, while exploring what may have been the Bahamas, and saw them growing in fields. Five kinds of Phaseolus beans were domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples, selecting pods that did not open and scatter their seeds when ripe: common beans (P. vulgaris) grown from Chile to the northern part of the United States; lima and sieva beans (P. lunatus); and the less widely distributed teparies (P. acutifolius), scarlet runner beans (P. coccineus), and polyanthus beans.\nPre-Columbian peoples as far north as the Atlantic seaboard grew beans in the \"Three Sisters\" method of companion planting. The beans were interplanted with maize and squash. Beans were cultivated across Chile in Pre-Hispanic times, likely as far south as the Chiloé Archipelago.\n\nDiversity\nTaxonomic range\nBeans are legumes, but from many different genera, native to different regions.\n\nConservation of cultivars\nThe biodiversity of bean cultivars is threatened by modern plant breeding, which selects a small number of the most productive varieties. Efforts are being made to conserve the germplasm of older varieties in different countries. As of 2023, the Norwegian Svalbard Global Seed Vault holds more than 40,000 accessions of Phaseolus bean species.\n\nCultivation\nAgronomy\nMany beans are summer crops that needs warm temperatures to grow; peas are an exception. Legumes are capable of nitrogen fixation and hence need less fertiliser than most plants. Maturity is typically 55–60 days from planting to harvest. As the pods mature, they turn yellow and dry up, and the beans inside change from green to their mature colour. Many beans are vines needing external support, such as \"bean cages\" or poles. Native Americans customarily grew them along with corn and squash, the tall stalks acting as support for the beans.\nMore recently, the commercial \"bush bean\" which does not require support and produces all its pods simultaneously has been developed.\n\nProduction\nThe production data for legumes are published by FAO in three categories:\n\nPulses dry: all mature and dry seeds of leguminous plants except soybeans and groundnuts.\nOil crops: soybeans and groundnuts.\nFresh vegetable: immature green fresh fruits of leguminous plants.\nThe following is a summary of FAO data.\n\nThe world leader in production of dry beans (Phaseolus spp), is India, followed by Myanmar (Burma) and Brazil. In Africa, the most important producer is Tanzania.\n\nSource: UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\n\nUses\nCulinary\nBeans can be cooked in a wide variety of casseroles, curries, salads, soups, and stews. They can be served whole or mashed alongside meat or toast, or included in an omelette or a flatbread wrap. Other options are to include them in a bake with a cheese sauce, a Mexican-style chili con carne, or to use them as a meat substitute in a burger or in falafels. The French cassoulet is a slow-cooked stew with haricot beans, sausage, pork, mutton, and preserved goose. Soybeans can be processed into bean curd (tofu) or fermented into a cake (tempeh); these can be eaten fried or roasted like meat, or included in stir-fries, curries, and soups. Most dry beans contain 21-25% protein by weight; dry soybeans are 36.5% protein by weight.\n\nOther\nGuar beans are used for their gum, a galactomannan polysaccharide. It is used to thicken and stabilise foods and other products.\n\nHealth concerns\nToxins\nSome kinds of raw beans contain a harmful, flavourless toxin: the lectin phytohaemagglutinin, which must be destroyed by cooking. Red kidney beans are particularly toxic, but other types also pose risks of food poisoning. Even small quantities (4 or 5 raw beans) may cause severe stomachache, vomiting, and diarrhea. This risk does not apply to canned beans because they have already been cooked. A recommended method is to boil the beans for at least ten minutes; under-cooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans.\nCooking beans, without bringing them to a boil, in a slow cooker at a temperature well below boiling may not destroy toxins. A case of poisoning by butter beans used to make falafel was reported; the beans were used instead of traditional broad beans or chickpeas, soaked and ground without boiling, made into patties, and shallow fried.\nBean poisoning is not well known in the medical community, and many cases may be misdiagnosed or never reported; figures appear not to be available. In the case of the UK National Poisons Information Service, available only to health professionals, the dangers of beans other than red beans were not flagged as of 2008.\nFermentation is used in some parts of Africa to improve the nutritional value of beans by removing toxins. Inexpensive fermentation improves the nutritional impact of flour from dry beans and improves digestibility, according to research co-authored by Emire Shimelis, from the Food Engineering Program at Addis Ababa University. Beans are a major source of dietary protein in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.\n\nOther hazards\nIt is common to make beansprouts by letting some types of bean, often mung beans, germinate in moist and warm conditions; beansprouts may be used as ingredients in cooked dishes, or eaten raw or lightly cooked. There have been many outbreaks of disease from bacterial contamination, often by salmonella, listeria, and Escherichia coli,  of beansprouts not thoroughly cooked, some causing significant mortality.\nMany types of bean like kidney bean contain significant amounts of antinutrients that inhibit some enzyme processes in the body. Phytic acid, present in beans, interferes with bone growth and interrupts vitamin D metabolism.\nMany beans, including broad beans, navy beans, kidney beans and soybeans, contain large sugar molecules, oligosaccharides (particularly raffinose and stachyose). A suitable oligosaccharide-cleaving enzyme is necessary to digest these. As the human digestive tract does not contain such enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are digested by bacteria in the large intestine, producing gases such as methane, released as flatulence.\n\nIn human society\nBeans have often been thought of as a food of the poor, as small farmers ate grains, vegetables, and got their protein from beans, while the wealthier classes were able to afford meat. European society has what Ken Albala calls \"a class-based antagonism\" to beans. \nDifferent cultures agree in disliking the flatulence that beans cause, and possess their own seasonings to attempt to remedy it: Mexico uses the herb epazote; India the aromatic resin asafoetida; Germany applies the herb savory; in the Middle East, cumin; and Japan the seaweed kombu. A substance for which there is evidence of effectiveness in reducing flatulence is the enzyme alpha-galactosidase; extracted from the mould fungus Aspergillus niger, it breaks down glycolipids and glycoproteins. The reputation of beans for flatulence is the theme of a children's song \"Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit\".\nThe Mexican jumping bean is a segment of a seed pod occupied by the larva of the moth Cydia saltitans, and sold as a novelty. The pods start to jump when warmed in the palm of the hand. Scientists have suggested that the random walk that results may help the larva to find shade and so to survive on hot days.\n\nSee also\nBaked beans\nList of bean soups\nFassoulada – a bean soup\nList of legume dishes\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nKaplan, Lawrence (2008). \"Legumes in the History of Human Nutrition\".

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken",
        "content": "Tekken (Japanese: 鉄拳（てっけん）, meaning \"Iron Fist\") is a Japanese media franchise centered on a series of fighting games developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Namco). The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.\nThe main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima Zaibatsu, where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot, while players explore other characters' motivations in aiming to control the Zaibatsu.\nGameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. Tekken is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.\nJapanese video game developer Namco began the series in 1994, with the release of the self-titled first entry. As of 2017, it has nine additional entries, eight spin-off games, and has been adapted into three feature films and other media. Tekken 2, as well as the third game Tekken 3, are considered landmark titles; they received critical acclaim for their gameplay and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed this concept and received generally positive critical responses. It has been mentioned as early as 2015 by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest running story in video games without reboots, retcons, or revisions. The Mishima saga covering the first ten games until Tekken 8 was described as a story revolving around the Iron Fist Tournament and a family aiming to destroy each other.\nThe series has been universally acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped over 58 million copies by 2024, making it the  third best-selling fighting game franchise. The main series has been widely credited by critics and video game publications for raising the standards of fighting games and praised for its gameplay mechanics and replay value.\n\nGames\nAll major installments of the series are originally arcade games, and the boards used to run them have traditionally been based on PlayStation hardware. Following their release in arcades, home releases in the series have mainly been for consoles in the PlayStation line.\n\n1994–1997: Original trilogy\nTekken\nThe first game in the series, Tekken, was released in 1994, first as an arcade game and as a port for the PlayStation in 1995. The game features eight playable characters, each with their own sub-boss. The PlayStation version features remixes of the stage themes and also made the sub-bosses playable for a total of eighteen characters, including a costume swap for Kazuya (Devil Kazuya). In addition, a cutscene is unlocked when the player finishes arcade mode with each of the original eight characters. The canon ending of the game consists of Kazuya exacting revenge on his father Heihachi Mishima, beating him in the tournament and tossing him off the same cliff that he was thrown off by Heihachi.\n\nTekken 2\nTekken 2 was released in 1995 in arcades and in 1996 for the PlayStation. A port was also made several years later for Zeebo. There are ten playable characters as well as fifteen to unlock, for a total of twenty-five characters. The home version features four new modes that would become staples to the series, which were Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Practice. The game features remixes of the arcade versions' characters' themes, and a cutscene unlocked once the player completes the arcade mode. The canon ending of this game consists of Heihachi surviving the fall, entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 and defeating Kazuya, throwing him into an erupting volcano and reclaiming the Mishima Zaibatsu. During the events of the second King of Iron First Tournament, Kazuya and Jun Kazama were mysteriously drawn to one another and became intimate.\n\nTekken 3\nTekken 3 was released in arcades and for the PlayStation in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Due to the 19-year storyline span between the game and its predecessor, the game largely features a new cast of characters, including the debut of staple main character Jin Kazama, the child of Kazuya and Jun, as well as now-staple characters Ling Xiaoyu and Hwoarang, with a total of twenty-three characters. The home version includes a mode called Tekken Force, as well as the bonus Tekken Ball mode, and also includes remixes to the characters' themes from the arcade version. The canon ending of Tekken 3 consists of Paul Phoenix defeating Ogre and leaving victorious. After its defeat, Ogre transforms into a monstrous creature, \"True Ogre\". Jin Kazama faces True Ogre and defeats him, avenging his mother. With Ogre out of the way, Jin's grandfather Heihachi shoots him, leaving him for dead. However, Jin survives, being revived by the Devil Gene he inherited from his father.\n\n1999–2004: Debut of team-battle oriented games\nTekken Tag Tournament\nTekken Tag Tournament was released in 1999 in arcades and as a launch title for the PlayStation 2 in 2000. Tekken Tag Tournament features tag battles and includes almost all of the Tekken characters in the series up until that point in time, for a total of 34 characters. The game ran on the same arcade board with an updated Tekken 3 engine, and thus saw major graphical upgrades when ported to the PlayStation 2. The home version features remixes of the characters' themes from the arcade version, and also features a bonus Tekken Bowl mode. A remastered version of the game, Tekken Tag Tournament HD, is included in the 2011 collection Tekken Hybrid, which also contained a playable demo of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and the film Tekken: Blood Vengeance.\n\nTekken 4\nTekken 4 is the fifth installment of the series, released in 2001 in arcades and 2002 for the PlayStation 2. The home version includes a new Story mode that unlocks cutscenes when played, in contrast to previous installments in which such cutscenes were unlocked from playing the Arcade Mode. Gameplay revisions include the ability for the player to move about before the round begins, as well as walled-stages. For the first time, the themes used in the arcade mode are the same ones put into the home version. There are 23 characters to choose from. The story reveals that Kazuya survived the fall into the volcano from 20 years prior, and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 to take back the Mishima Zaibatsu. In the canonical ending, Kazuya and Heihachi are both defeated by Jin. Jin unwillingly transforms into his Devil form, but after glimpsing a vision of his mother, Jun (whom he had not seen in six years), he refrains from executing Heihachi.\n\nTekken 5\nTekken 5 was released in arcades in 2004 and 2005 for the PlayStation 2, with a short period of time of transition from arcade to PlayStation, of two months in North America and four months in Japan. There are 32 characters to choose from, including staple newcomers Devil Jin and Osaka's Asuka Kazama. Many of the characters who were removed in Tekken 3 returned in Tekken 5. The home version includes a mode known as Devil Within, a variant of the Tekken Force mode introduced in Tekken 3. In the canonical ending, Jin Kazama defeats his great-grandfather Jinpachi Mishima (who took over the Mishima Zaibatsu shortly after the ending events of Tekken 4), and inherits the Mishima Zaibatsu.\n\n2005–present: Expansion and other projects\nTekken 5: Dark Resurrection\nAlthough Tekken games normally saw updates to the arcade versions, Tekken 5 was the first installment in the series that had a revision significant enough that it was rereleased, with the subtitle Dark Resurrection in 2005. The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2006 and features two new characters: Emilie \"Lili\" De Rochefort and Sergei Dragunov.  Armor King was also reintroduced as a playable character in this revision.  The game also introduces a ranking system to the series. The home version featured new modes, such as Ghost Mode, Tekken Dojo Mode, and the two bonus modes, Gold Rush mode, and a revised version of the Tekken Bowl mode introduced in Tekken Tag Tournament. The Devil Within mode from the PlayStation 2 version however, was absent. Namco Bandai saw the fan demand for a console version and a port for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network was released in 2007, in full 1080p HD. The PlayStation 3 version also saw an update and was retitled Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection ONLINE, marking the first time in the series that online play was featured. The PlayStation 3 version also made Jinpachi Mishima playable (but not online).\n\nTekken 6\nTekken 6 was originally released in arcades in 2007, followed by an updated version in 2008 titled Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion. The home version was based on Bloodline Rebellion and was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, marking the first time in the series that a game was multiplatform. The game features a Scenario Campaign mode, which follows gameplay from previous Tekken Force modes, which was playable online alongside standard versus. In the Scenario Campaign ending, after being defeated by Heihachi's illegitimate son Lars Alexandersson (who suffered amnesia at one point during the Scenario Campaign), Jin Kazama is revealed to have wreaked havoc and waged war on the world to fill it with negative energy and generate a physical manifestation of Azazel, so that he himself can face and kill him, as he believed that killing Azazel may purge Jin himself from the Devil Gene inside his body. After the battle, Jin's body is found by Raven, and the Devil Gene is still intact in his body.\n\nTekken Tag Tournament 2\nTekken Tag Tournament 2 was released in Japanese arcades in 2011. Its console version was released the next year and is based on the updated arcade version called Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited that contained new features. The Wii U version, which served as a launch title for the console, includes a revised version of the Tekken Ball mode from Tekken 3 and exclusive Nintendo themed costumes for each character, as well as a new mode that makes use of the mushrooms from the Super Mario Bros. franchise. Like the previous iteration, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 includes nearly every character up to that point and a few exclusive characters. Lili's butler Sebastian, Eddy Gordo’s disco-oriented alter ego Tiger Jackson, a new female wrestler character named Jaycee, who is actually Julia Chang in disguise but was made to differentiate the play style of Julia and her mother Michelle Chang, and Slim Bob a slender version of Bob. A demo version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was released as part of Tekken Hybrid including exclusive designs for Devil and Devil Jin from the film Tekken: Blood Vengeance. American rapper Snoop Dogg was featured in the game with his own stage and an original song by the rapper titled “Knocc ‘em Down”.\n\nTekken 7\nIn early 2014, Katsuhiro Harada expressed interest in continuing the series on PlayStation 4. Tekken 7 was released in Japanese and Korean arcades in 2015. It is the first game in the series to be powered by the Unreal Engine. The game received an update, subtitled Fated Retribution and released to arcades on July 5, 2016, and featured the series' second, third, fourth and fifth guest characters, the guest characters appearing are Akuma from the Street Fighter franchise by Capcom, Geese Howard from SNK's fighting game franchises, Noctis Lucis Caelum from the Final Fantasy franchise by Square Enix and Negan Smith from The Walking Dead franchise. The PlayStation 4 version was confirmed at Paris Games Week 2015, and features exclusive content as well as virtual reality support. The Xbox One and Microsoft Windows versions were released on June 2, 2017, alongside the PlayStation 4 version, and are based on the Fated Retribution. In the canonical ending, considered the conclusion of the Mishima saga, Heihachi takes control of the Zaibatsu, and attempts to expose Kazuya of the Devil Gene, after a failed attempt on capturing a missing Jin, who was found safely by his uncles Lars and Lee. In their final battle, Kazuya permanently kills Heihachi and throws him into an erupting volcano, whereas Jin, who recovered from his coma thanks to Lars and Lee, declares that he must kill Kazuya to end the cursed Mishima bloodline. It was also revealed that Heihachi killed his wife Kazumi in self-defense because of her possession of the Devil Gene and the fact that she had gained a split personality because of it, shortly after Kazuya was born. Few side playable characters’ storylines have their endings from Tekken Tag Tournament 2 ties to this game.\n\nTekken 8\nA teaser for a new mainline entry in the series was shown during Tekken 7's tournament at EVO 2022, before being formally announced on September 13, 2022 during Sony's State of Play presentation. It was released on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC through Steam on January 26, 2024. As a continuation from the seventh mainline game, it focuses on a conclusion of Kazuya and Jin's enmity. In contrast to the seventh mainline game's utility of Unreal Engine 4, Tekken 8 will utilize Unreal Engine 5, making it the first fighting game to do so. This game was announced on January 6, 2023 to be co-developed with Arika, who also handles the recent patch(es) for Tekken 7.\n\nSpin-off and crossover games\nTekken 3 was also ported to the Game Boy Advance as Tekken Advance in 2001. Tekken 6-based Tekken 3D: Prime Edition was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. A free to play version of Tekken was released in 2013 for PSN as Tekken Revolution. Tekken Card Challenge was released on the WonderSwan, a Japan-exclusive handheld, in 1999. A spin-off action adventure game featuring series' character Nina Williams as the protagonist, Death by Degrees, released for the PS2 in 2005. Tekken Resolute, a 2D fighting game which was the first game not to include Heihachi Mishima, was released in 2010 for the J2ME platform, and Tekken Bowl, the bowling mini-game from Tekken Tag Tournament, was released in 2011 for the iOS operating system. Tekken Bowl was the first game not to include Yoshimitsu, Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, or King. In 2013, a third mobile game titled Tekken Card Tournament was released by Namco Bandai to the App Store for iOS and Google Play Store on Android. That same year, Namco Bandai also released Tekken Arena to the Google Play Store on Android. On April 30, 2015, Namco released Galaga: Tekken 20th Anniversary Edition, a mobile game variant of Galaga featuring characters from the franchise. It was originally announced on April 1, 2015.\nNamco and Capcom agreed to create crossover games of the Tekken and Street Fighter franchises. In 2012, Street Fighter X Tekken was released, which was developed by Capcom and includes 2D gameplay mechanics as seen in Street Fighter IV.  Namco was also developing Tekken X Street Fighter, which would feature gameplay mechanics similar to Tekken Tag Tournament 2, but it was placed on hold indefinitely in 2016.\nPokkén Tournament was announced in August 2014, as a spin-off of the franchise set within the Pokémon franchise. It was initially released in Japan as an arcade game, but was released internationally on Wii U in 2016, and is also ported to Nintendo Switch.\nTekken Mobile, another spinoff, was released on March 1, 2018. Although it had a mixed reception from critics, it was well received by the public and exceeded one million downloads.\n\nDevelopment\nTekken was not originally conceived as a fighting game. The project began as an internal Namco test case for animating 3D character models, and eventually incorporated texture mapping similar to that found in Namco's 1993 racing game Ridge Racer. Directed by Virtua Fighter designer Seiichi Ishii, Tekken was intended to be a fundamentally similar title, with the addition of detailed textures that were not blocky on the characters like Virtua Fighter 2 and twice the frame rate. It was the first 3D fighting game to use the modern 60 fps standard.\n\nGameplay\nAs with many fighting games, players choose a character from a lineup and engage in hand-to-hand combat with an opponent. Traditional fighting games are usually played with buttons which correspond to the strength of the attack, such as strong punch or weak kick. Tekken, however, dedicates a button to each of the four limbs of the fighter. The gameplay system includes blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting.\nIn the original Tekken, players could only block attacks manually. From then on, starting with Tekken 2, characters automatically block while not moving forward or performing actions, a feature called \"neutral guard.\" Standing or retreating characters will block high and middle attacks with no input from the player, while crouching characters will duck high attacks and block low ones. Normal middle attacks will hit crouching players, but some special mid-attacks can be blocked by both stand and crouching neutral guards. Meanwhile, pressing backwards will give the player an \"active guard\" that can withstand certain combo attacks that would normally penetrate the neutral guard. Some characters are equipped with parries and reversals that act like traditional \"press button to block\" systems.\nTekken 3 introduced several gameplay possibilities that were retained in later games, including the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background. Tekken 3 and later games also reduced recovery time after being knocked down and gave characters rolls to recover instantly after hitting the ground, allowing the player to get back into the fight more quickly at the risk of being hit while rolling. \nTekken 4 was another leap, and gave characters even greater mobility by adding true 3D movement inside geometrically complex arenas with uneven ground, obstacles, and walls. The 3D gameplay allows damaging side and back throws as a reward for outmaneuvering the opponent, as well as evasive attacks that develop directly from a sidestep. Tekken 4 received mixed feedback  to the point of being considered by some as one of the worst installments in the series which led to major changes starting with Tekken 5. This was done thanks to the new engine provided by Namco. In retrospect, Harada believes Tekken 5, and Tekken 6, managed to attract a new group of fans, something Tekken 4 did not largely do. However, the game has significantly grown in acclaim after some years due to its realism in gameplay and gritty story arcs. Harada has even improved his thoughts on the game and has gone on to call it the best game or peak in the series during an interview for the new Tekken 8. According to Harada, the innovation went \"the other way\" or reverted to more conservatism beginning Tekken 5. Much of the positive changes and reviews were not focused on in Tekken 4, and instead Harada focused only on the negative reviews against it, which in hindsight was not the proper way to make a fighting game starting with Tekken 5. Thus, he felt the game could have been even better, despite the eventual huge success upon its debut in late 2004. Tekken 5 also saw a combination of walled and infinite arenas, while discarding uneven ground and terrain to allow more juggling. \nTekken 6 retains much of the design from Tekken 5, but it also includes a \"Rage\" mode, which activates when a character is near the end of his vitality bar and earns a damage multiplier. \"Bound\" (later known as \"Ground Bound\") hits were also added, in which a player connected with an airborne opponent will place him in an inescapable grounded state, allowing combo extensions. Tekken 6 also has destructible floors and walls that allow the fighters to blast through to new fighting areas when broken. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 retains these elements while also adding a new kind of stage break (\"balcony breaks\", which is a combination of floor and wall breaks where characters will go through a breakable wall and fall to a lower level in the same sequence). Tag 2 specific features include Tag Assaults (cooperative combos triggered by hitting a Bound and a tag at the same time) and Tag Crashes (an emergency tag occurring when downed and the partner is currently in Rage).\nTekken 7 introduces some movement changes to the Tekken formula. The back walk animation is now similar to Tekken Revolution, featuring a more fluid movement away from the opponent as opposed to a slower shuffle. Regular back rolling from a grounded state has been removed and instead replaced with new rising animation and performing an \"ankle kick\" (kicking the standing opponent while laying face up on the ground) is now accompanied by a new back roll to help create separation. Balcony breaks from Tag Tournament 2 are present and function similarly to how they did in solo play. New features include \"Power Crushes\" (an attack that cannot be interrupted by regular attacks once the animation has begun) and \"Rage Arts\" (a super move attack that can only be used when your character has hit a Raged state near the end of their vitality meter, sacrificing the Rage mode to perform the attack). Bound has been mostly removed save for specific situations (certain moves can cause a Ground Bound if not combo-ed into and all low parries will cause a Ground Bound effect, similar to Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion; floor breaks now result in an effect similar to a Tag Assault in Tag 2 rather than a standard Ground Bound) and instead, characters now have more frequent access to an \"Aerial Tailspin\" effect (an attack that throws an opponent backward onto their head as opposed to straight downwards, although it is still inescapable once triggered which means the combo can continue). Later Tekken 7 updates eventually add \"Rage Drive\" (also cost Rage mode, and is an equivalent of EX and lower level super moves) as of Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, with the console ports' post-Season 1 adds two new damage properties which were originally existed in previous characters and still can only work against an opponent while they are on the ground. Tekken 7 Season 2 adds \"Wall Bound\" mechanic, which bounces opponents from the wall to nearby them to an airborne state with a knockdown attack, originally used by both NANCY-MI847J in Tekken 6 and a guest character Geese Howard prior to Season 2. However, currently, only a guest character Negan Smith can utilize Wall Bounce against an airborne opponent via one of his Rage Drives. The last update patch of Tekken 7 Season 4 adds \"Wall Stun\", which causes opponents to be bounced from the wall and entered a downed hit stun, whether they were being hit by or blocked their attacking opponents' attack.\nTekken 8 introduced a new heat mode making the game oriented toward offensive play and creates more opportunities to turn the tide of a fight.\n\nCharacters\nPlayers can choose from a diverse cast that hails from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and fighting styles. A few characters have supernatural origin, such as Devil, Alisa Bosconovitch, Angel, Mokujin, Ogre and Azazel, while animal characters like Kuma, Panda, the Roger family, and Alex provide comic relief. In the story mode of the game, each character generally has their own personal reasons for entering the tournament and competing for the prize.\nThe protagonist of the series has varied between installments; the character ending of each canon game determines the protagonist of each. Kazuya Mishima was the protagonist in the original game and Tekken 7, his father Heihachi Mishima was the protagonist of Tekken 2, and Jin Kazama has been one of the central protagonists since his debut in Tekken 3 with Kazuya and Heihachi sharing the mantle in Tekken 7. The conflict between the Mishima family within multiple generations serves as the main conflict to the series' plot or at least the Mishima saga according to Katsuhiro Harada, who describes it as a simple struggle of the three men aiming to destroy one another and the devil gene. Although Lars Alexandersson among other characters are not fully related to them, they serve as major characters within Tekken 6 where Jin serves as the main antagonist instead of his relatives.\nCharacters with background connections in the story typically have styles or moves in common. For example, Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, by virtues of familial connection and studying under the same Advanced Mishima Style Fighting Karate discipline, have very similar moves and a signature \"crouch dash\" stance for pretty much their entire appearances in the series. Jin Kazama, when he debuted, also had the same Mishima fighting style, though he mixed this with Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts as practiced by his mother, Jun Kazama. For storyline reasons, starting on Tekken 4, he forwent this in favor of Traditional Karate, a completely different discipline that technically made him an entirely different character, while his old movelist was given to his demonic form, Devil Jin. Meanwhile, there are some characters who were formerly clones of each other before they diverged and gained unique moves, such as Lee Chaolan (a clone of Marshall Law), Anna Williams (a clone of her sister, Nina), and Armor King (a clone of King). Still further, there are also characters who are replacements or \"successors\" of older characters; this happened principally in Tekken 3 due to the significant time skip, though some older characters later returned alongside their successors anyway. Examples include Julia Chang (replacing her adoptive mother, Michelle), Hwoarang (replacing his mentor, Baek Doo San, who later returned) and as mentioned above, Jin Kazama (replacing both of his parents, Kazuya and Jun, the former of whom later returned, while the latter was replaced by Asuka Kazama). Another example of two characters sharing a moveset can be seen with Eddy Gordo, a Brazilian representing the dance fighting martial art known as Capoeira. He shares these dance fighting moves with his mentee, Christie Monteiro.\nSome Tekken characters have been featured as guest characters in other video games, such as Anna Kournikova's Smash Court Tennis, Digimon World Re:Digitize, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Pac-Man Fever, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, Ridge Racer 6, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2, Soulcalibur II, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Brawlhalla, and Urban Reign, as well as in some crossover role-playing video games, including Cross Edge, Namco × Capcom, Project X Zone, Project X Zone 2, Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos and The King of Fighters All Star.\n\nAdaptations\nAnime series\nTekken: Bloodline, a streaming television anime series, was announced by Netflix in March 2022. It loosely adapts the events of Tekken 3 and was released on August 18, 2022.\n\nAnimated films\nTekken: The Motion Picture, a two-part OVA anime series, was released in Japan in 1998. It was developed by Studio Deen and directed by Kunihisa Sugishima. Its story follows Kazuya Mishima's revenge against his father Heihachi in the King of Iron Fist Tournament.\nTekken: Blood Vengeance, a full-length animated film in Digital 3D directed by Youichi Mouri, premiered in the United States in 2011 and was released in Japan two months later that same year. Digital Frontier developed and Bandai Entertainment distributed the film. Blood Vengeance is an alternate retelling between the events of Tekken 5 and Tekken 6. It was released in Japan in December 2011 as a part of the Tekken Hybrid collection.\n\nLive-action films\nTekken is a live-action film directed by Dwight Little and starring Jon Foo, Ian Anthony Dale and Kelly Overton. It was released at the AFI Film Festival on November 5, 2009, and in Japan on March 20, 2010, through Warner Bros. The film focuses on Jin Kazama who enters into the King of Iron Fist Tournament after his mother's death. Katsuhiro Harada, director of the Tekken video game series, has panned the film.\nA prequel to the 2009 film titled Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge was released direct-to-DVD on August 12, 2014. It is directed by Wych Kaosayananda and stars Kane Kosugi and Kelly Wenham, with Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Gary Daniels returning from the first film. Variety reports that Paul Stevens will produce a Tekken remake with China's company Financing City Network.\nTekken Tag Tournament 2, a live-action short film by Wild Stunt Europe, was released on Namco Bandai Games Europe's YouTube channel on October 19, 2012.\n\nOther media\nThere have been five printed adaptations of the Tekken games. Knightstone Comics published both Tekken Saga and Tekken 2, released in October 1997 and September 1998 respectively. Both comics were written by John Kim and illustrated by Walter McDaniel. Tekken Forever, a comic book by Dave Chi, illustrated by Paco Diaz, and published by Image Comics in December 2001, features a story that focused on the Kazama family and also the Unknown character from Tekken Tag Tournament. Tekken: Tatakai no Kanatani (鉄拳：闘いの彼方に, lit. \"Tekken: The Other Side of Battle\") is a manga written by Keiichi Suzuki and published by Shogakukan, which was collected in two tankōbon volumes with the first one on December 5, 2000, and the second one on April 5, 2001. Tekken Comic is a manga illustrated by Rui Takato and published by Ultra Egg Jump in 2009. Although the story leads up to the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6, it is non-canonical to the main video game series. In October 2016, Titan Comics announced a new Tekken comic book, a four-issue mini-series by Cavan Scott, illustrated by Andie Tong, and published in mid-2017. The series takes place between Tekken 6 and 7, and deals with Jin struggling against the Devil within him.\nCharacters and settings from the series also appear in the collectible card game Universal Fighting System by Fantasy Flight Games and in Epic Battles by Score Entertainment.\n\nReception\nCritical reception to the games has been positive, with the series arguably peaking with the release of Tekken 3 that received an average of 96% at Metacritic and GameRankings, and to this day considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Other candidate games have been Tekken 2, Tekken Tag Tournament, and Tekken 8.\nIn 1999, Next Generation listed the Tekken series as number 12 on their \"Top 50 Games of All Time\", commenting that, \"In the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit, Tekken stole the crown from Street Fighter as the king of modern brawlers with addictive fighting in its rawest form.\"\nDevelopers of non-Tekken games have commented on the series in various ways. Ed Boon, the co-creator of Mortal Kombat, revealed in one of his interviews with GamePro that his favorite fighting game out of his competitors is Tekken. Both Sega and Namco have shown interest in a possible crossover between Virtua Fighter and Tekken, which came in the form of Project X Zone and its sequel for the 3DS. Tekken is known to have been heavily inspired by Virtua Fighter and the series has often been labelled as a \"rival\" to Virtua Fighter as they became two of the most famous 3D fighting game series along with Soulcalibur and Dead or Alive. On the other hand, Tomonobu Itagaki, designer of the Dead or Alive series, expressed dislike for the Tekken franchise due to Namco running radio commercial ads insulting his Dead or Alive series, prompting Itagaki to place it as one of his most disliked games.\nIn 2004's Shaun of the Dead, characters Pete, Shaun, and Ed \"stayed up all night, drinking apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.\" Tekken 3 is considered one of the greatest games of all time.\nIn 2012, Complex ranked Tekken at number 11 on the list of the best video game franchises, commenting: \"Just when we thought that the Street Fighter franchise was going to be the epitome of fighting games, Tekken came to make it share its portion of the knuckle-busting pie. Tekken has cult-like fans who live and breathe the moves and storylines.\"\n\nSales\nAs of March 2023, the Tekken franchise had sold over 58 million copies worldwide. Tekken 7 is the highest-selling game in the franchise, selling over 12 million copies as of August 2024.\n\nLegacy\nSince the series has a long history of being exclusive to PlayStation along with the arcade cabinets running on PlayStation hardware, Tekken has been associated closely with the PlayStation brand. Katsuhiro Harada has stated that PlayStation remains the main platform of development for Tekken.\nThe first game in the series was the first PlayStation game to sell over a million units, which earned it a Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition award in 2008, among other awards including \"First Fighting Game To Feature Simulated 3D\", and a record for the entire series, \"The Best Selling Fighting Series for PlayStation Consoles.\" Tekken Tag Tournament was one of the most popular launch titles for the PlayStation 2.\nAnother game developed by Namco, Soulcalibur II, included exclusive characters for different console versions and featured Heihachi Mishima, a character that has been in all Tekken games and the protagonist of Tekken 2, exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version. He was also playable in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and is Harada's favorite character in the series.\nTekken 7's PlayStation 4 announcement trailer featured a retrospective celebration of \"20 Years of Tekken\", and the PlayStation 4 version of the game features exclusive content from previous titles in the series, including character costumes and musical tracks. The PlayStation 4 version was the best selling version of the game, and provided a 6% boost in hardware sales in Japan. While PlayStation Classic was not well received by the public, Tekken 3 was included in the preloaded collection. Tekken 3 is also available in all regions.\nAstro's Playroom, a 2020 video game released as a launch title for PlayStation 5, included a homage to the Tekken series. The inclusion was supervised by Harada as well. The successor, 2024's Astro Bot, also including a reference to Tekken. Closed network testing of Tekken 8 was available first exclusively to PlayStation 5, as well as a demo. While Windows became the most popular platform for Tekken 8, sales on the PlayStation 5 version were significantly higher than the Xbox SeriesX/S's.\nIn May 2012, Namco Bandai opened Tekken Museum in Osaka, Japan. The museum showcases goods, action figures, artworks, life-size statues of Tekken characters, and various merchandise. The items on display are rotated regularly so that the museum is worth multiple visits.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Mukluks or kamik (Inuktitut: ᑲᒥᒃ [kaˈmik]) (singular: ᑲᒪᒃ kamak, plural: ᑲᒦᑦ kamiit) are soft boots, traditionally made of reindeer (caribou) skin or sealskin, and worn by Indigenous Arctic peoples, including Inuit, Iñupiat, and Yup'ik.\nMukluks may be worn over an inner boot liner and under a protective overshoe. The term mukluk is often used for any soft boot designed for cold weather, and modern designs may use both traditional and modern materials. The word mukluk is of Yup'ik origin, from maklak, the bearded seal, while kamik is an Inuit word.\n\nRelated boots\nSoft-soled boots, of similar materials (mostly sealskin and caribou-skin) and designs, but with local variations, are traditionally worn in the Arctic and subarctic areas. These include the North American Arctic, including Greenland, the European Arctic, including Fennoscandia, and Siberia.\nAnother type of boot, sometimes called an Inuit boot, originating in Greenland and the eastern part of Alaska, is made by binding it with animal sinew, and has a centre seam running down to the foot of the boot.\nAnother type has a soft leather sole, but the upper is knitted out of wool or a wool-rayon blend. Often called \"slipper socks\", these are traditionally worn by the people of the Hindu Kush mountains.\n\nUse\nAs mukluks are soft-soled, and flex with the feet, they allow hunters to move very quietly. A wearer can run, tip-toe, and even dance in mukluks. They are also designed for use in the tundra.\nMukluks weigh little. While, for instance, the United States Marines extreme-cold-weather boots weigh 3.6 kg (8 lb), soft-soled boots made using modern materials weigh less than a tenth of that. Lighter shoes also allow for more efficient running.\n\nCare\nFur garments, including kamiks, are in the modern day stored in an unheated annexe. In a home with forced-air heating, the interior air is warm and very dry. The warmth and dryness would cause the furs to deteriorate quickly. On sunny days they are aired outside, especially in spring. After a season's storage, traditional skin kamiks tend to stiffen and need to be worked and stretched to make them pliable again.\nAllowing traditional boots to dry between uses hinders rot, letting the boots last longer. Multiple pairs can be worn in rotation to allow them more time to dry.: 79\n\nDesign\nBecause mukluks weigh little, there is no need for heavy lacing; friction is enough to hold them on the foot. Some mukluks are very lightly laced (through external loops sewn into the seams, so as not to leak). They may be laced over the arch of the foot, or around the top of the boot to stiffen it. Many, however, are designed without lacing, to avoid constricting the circulation and making the foot cold. The top of the boot stands up somewhat stiffly, and may be open at the top, which allows moisture to escape.\nMukluks are often made with a wrapped sole, so that the seam around the sole is on the top and sides of the boot, not on the bottom edge. This helps avoid leaks, and wear and tear on the seams.\nKamiks made for cold, dry winter weather may have fur low down on the outside, and other features that would be a problem when not on dry, powdery snow. Kamiks for warm, slushy, muddy, or open-ocean conditions are finely stitched from waterproof sealskin (see illustration above).\nThe short overshoes may also be made waterproof for wet conditions, or furry with more grip for dry terrain. The inner boots are often made with the fur facing inwards. They are worn without socks, because socks absorb and hold sweat.\nMukluks may be adorned with pom-poms, beads, embroidery, and other techniques.\nThe design of the mukluk is used for the industrial manufacture of some other cold-weather boots, especially paired with a rugged contemporary sole. The key component of the overall success of the mukluk design is its ability to breathe, that is, to allow air exchange. This is an advantage in extremely cold conditions where perspiration may become a factor in frostbite on one's feet. Their bulkiness, paired with their poor performance in slush (they keep snow out, but water quickly soaks through), makes them less ideal for the casual winter wearer.\n\nManufacture\nUsually, the uppers of summer kamik are made from ringed seal skin, while the soles are made of bearded seal skin, which is tougher. Winter kamik are often made of caribou leg fur; caribou, unlike seals, rely on fur rather than blubber for insulation, so their fur is warmer.\nThe skin requires laborious preparation. Seals must be skinned, and the skins blubbered, washed in dish soap, scraped to clean them, hung to drain, and then stretched to dry outside. The skins may be bleached in the sun, and for summer kamik, they are generally scraped clean of fur to allow watertight stitching. Blind-stitching (not piercing the full depth of the skin) with sinew, which shrinks when wet, helps keep mukluks watertight. Commercial boots of modern materials will often require seam-sealing after purchase if they are to be fully waterproof.\nFor insulation, mukluks may be lined with furs such as caribou, Arctic hare, Arctic fox and more modern imports such as raccoon or rabbit. Commercial sheepskin may be used to line and sole boots, as of the first decade of the 20th century. Down, polyester, and closed-celled EVA foam is also used in soft-soled boots. The inner boot may also be made of textile, or wool felt.\n\nGallery\nSee also\n\nInuit clothing#Footwear\nUgg boots\nYupʼik clothing\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A gingerbread man is a biscuit or cookie made from gingerbread, usually in the shape of a stylized human being. However, other shapes, especially seasonal themes (Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc.), and characters are also common.\n\nHistory\nGingerbread dates from the 15th century and figurative biscuit-making was practised in the 16th century. The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits was at the court of Elizabeth I of England. She had the gingerbread figures made and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests, who brought the human shape of the gingerbread cookies.\n\nCharacteristics\nMost gingerbread men share a roughly humanoid shape, with stubby feet and no fingers. Many gingerbread people have a face, though whether the features are indentations within the face itself or other candies stuck on with icing or chocolate varies from recipe to recipe. Other decorations are common; hair, shirt cuffs, and shoes are sometimes applied, but by far the most popular decoration is shirt buttons, which are traditionally represented by gum drops, icing, or raisins.\n\nIn world records\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, the world's largest gingerbread man was made by the staff of the IKEA Furuset store in Oslo, Norway, on 9 November 2009. The gingerbread man weighed 1435.2 pounds (651 kg).\n\nIn fiction and popular culture\n\"The Gingerbread Man\" is a fairy tale about a gingerbread man who comes to life, outruns an elderly couple and various animals, and is devoured by a fox in the end.\nGingy is a talking gingerbread man character in the Shrek series of animated movies. He is derived from the fairy tale \"The Gingerbread Man\".\nThe Jasper Fforde comic detective novel The Fourth Bear features a more-than-human-sized gingerbread man who is a psychopathic serial killer who likes to pull off his victims' limbs.  The difficulties in catching him are a reference to the fairy tale.\nIn Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker (1892), the eponymous hero leads an army of gingerbread men against the Mouse King and his fellows.\nThe Gingerbread People are the main characters in the game Candy Land (1945).\nThe Gingerbread Men were featured in The Muppet Show. In the \"Don Knotts\" episode, the Gingerbread Men sing the song \"Sweet Gingerbread Man\" as the opening number. The lead Gingerbread Man is a hand-rod Muppet performed by Frank Oz while the full-bodied Gingerbread Men were performed by Jim Henson, Dave Goelz, Richard Hunt, and\nIn the film The Brothers Grimm, a nightmarish twist on the Gingerbread Man appears. A young child is splashed with mud, which steals the child's eyes, nose, and mouth. It then forms a small mud body with the child's stolen features for a face. The creature grabs the child and absorbs her into itself. It runs off yelling, \"You can't catch me; I'm the Gingerbread Man!\"\nThe first game in the Cookie Run series, Ovenbreak, is a runner game that puts players in the role of GingerBrave, a gingerbread man running to escape from the Witch's Oven. Subsequent games would introduce numerous other \"Cookies\", iterations of gingerbread men based on different combinations of ingredients and character archetypes.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Gingerbread men at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "A gale is a strong wind; the word is typically used as a descriptor in nautical contexts. The U.S. National Weather Service defines a gale as sustained surface wind moving at a speed between 34 and 47 knots (63.0 and 87.0 km/h; 17.5 and 24.2 m/s; 39.1 and 54.1 mph). Forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expected. In the United States, a gale warning is specifically a maritime warning; the land-based equivalent in National Weather Service warning products is a wind advisory.\nOther sources use minima as low as 28 knots (52 km/h; 14 m/s; 32 mph), and maxima as high as 90 knots (170 km/h; 46 m/s; 100 mph).  Through 1986, the National Hurricane Center used the term “gale” to refer to winds of tropical force for coastal areas between 33 knots (61 km/h; 17 m/s; 38 mph) and 63 knots (117 km/h; 32 m/s; 72 mph). The 90 knots (170 km/h; 46 m/s; 100 mph) definition is very non-standard. A common alternative definition of the maximum is 55 knots (102 km/h; 63 mph; 28 m/s).\nThe most common way of describing wind force is with the Beaufort scale that defines a gale as wind from 50 kilometres per hour (14 m/s) to 102 kilometres per hour (28 m/s). It is an empirical measure for describing wind speed based mainly on observed sea conditions. On the original 1810 Beaufort wind force scale, there were four different \"gale\" designations whereas generally today there are two gale forces, 8 and 9, and a near gale 7:\n\nEtymology\nThe word gale is derived from the Middle English gale, a general word for wind of any strength, even a breeze. This word is probably of North Germanic origin, related to Icelandic gola (breeze) and Danish gal (furious, mad), which are both from Old Norse gala (to sing), from Proto-Germanic *galaną (to roop, sing, charm), from Proto-Indo-European *gʰel- (to shout, scream, charm away).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "streamer": "RAIN",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain",
        "content": "Rain is a form of precipitation where water droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides water for hydroelectric power plants, crop irrigation, and suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems.\nThe major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.\nThe urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics. Antarctica is the driest continent. The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth, it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in). Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. Rainfall is measured using rain gauges. Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.\n\nFormation\nWater-saturated air\nAir contains water vapor, and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in the air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100% relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible tiny water or ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.\nThere are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.\nThe main ways water vapor is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.\n\nCoalescence and fragmentation\nCoalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets. Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets.\nAs these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing (in their top) and is also known as the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.\nRaindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 9 mm (0.0039 to 0.3543 in) mean diameter but develop a tendency to break up at larger sizes. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom, like hamburger buns; very large ones are shaped like parachutes. Contrary to popular belief, their shape does not resemble a teardrop. The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over Brazil and the Marshall Islands in 2004 — some of them were as large as 10 mm (0.39 in). The large size is explained by condensation on large smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.\nRaindrops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other raindrops.\nIntensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high-intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low-intensity storms can have a long duration.\n\nDroplet size distribution\nThe final droplet size distribution is an exponential distribution. The number of droplets with diameter between \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        +\n        d\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D+dD}\n  \n per unit volume of space is \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        (\n        d\n        )\n        =\n        \n          n\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            −\n            d\n            \n              /\n            \n            ⟨\n            d\n            ⟩\n          \n        \n        d\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n(d)=n_{0}e^{-d/\\langle d\\rangle }dD}\n  \n. This is commonly referred to as the Marshall–Palmer law after the researchers who first characterized it. The parameters are somewhat temperature-dependent, and the slope also scales with the rate of rainfall \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟨\n        d\n        \n          ⟩\n          \n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        41\n        \n          R\n          \n            −\n            0.21\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle d\\rangle ^{-1}=41R^{-0.21}}\n  \n (d in centimeters and R in millimeters per hour).\nDeviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions. The distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall, while instantaneous size spectra often deviate and have been modeled as gamma distributions. The distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation.\n\nRaindrop impacts\nRaindrops impact at their terminal velocity, which is greater for larger drops due to their larger mass-to-drag ratio. At sea level and without wind, 0.5 mm (0.020 in) drizzle impacts at 2 m/s (6.6 ft/s) or 7.2 km/h (4.5 mph), while large 5 mm (0.20 in) drops impact at around 9 m/s (30 ft/s) or 32 km/h (20 mph).\nRain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized, called raindrop impressions. The air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain the density of the air 2.7 billion years ago.\nThe sound of raindrops hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater.\nThe METAR code for rain is RA, while the coding for rain showers is SHRA.\n\nVirga\nIn certain conditions, precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching the ground. This is termed virga and is more often seen in hot and dry climates.\n\nCauses\nFrontal activity\nStratiform (a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones.\nA wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually, their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near-surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3,400 m (11,000 ft) above ground level.\n\nConvection\nConvective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.\n\nOrographic effects\nOrographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.\nIn Hawaii, Mount Waiʻaleʻale, on the island of Kauai, is notable for its extreme rainfall, as it is amongst the places in the world with the highest levels of rainfall, with 9,500 mm (373 in). Systems known as Kona storms affect the state with heavy rains between October and April. Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (Koʻolau) and leeward (Kona) regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.\nIn South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desert-like climate just downwind across western Argentina. The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.\n\nWithin the tropics\nThe wet, or rainy, season is the time of year, covering one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.\nTropical cyclones, a source of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counterclockwise (northern hemisphere). Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.\n\nHuman influence\nThe fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms cloud condensation nuclei leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States' Eastern Seaboard, the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays. The urban heat island effect warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 °C (33.1 to 42.1 °F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between 32 and 64 km (20 and 40 mi) downwind of cities, compared with upwind. Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.\nIncreasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1 percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1 percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25 percent).\nAnalysis of 65 years of United States of America rainfall records show the lower 48 states have an increase in heavy downpours since 1950. The largest increases are in the Northeast and Midwest, which in the past decade, have seen 31 and 16 percent more heavy downpours compared to the 1950s. Rhode Island is the state with the largest increase, 104%. McAllen, Texas is the city with the largest increase, 700%. Heavy downpour in the analysis are the days where total precipitation exceeded the top one percent of all rain and snow days during the years 1950–2014.\nThe most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding, which include techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and suppress hail.\n\nCharacteristics\nPatterns\nRainbands are cloud and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.\nRainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes. Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.\nOnce a cyclone occludes an occluded front (a trough of warm air aloft) will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also termed the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The front creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the front is unstable enough for convection. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain. Behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low-level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.\nRainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a hurricane or tropical storm. The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.\n\nAcidity\nThe phrase acid rain was first used by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, especially due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that is derived from the Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0–5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8–4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate-reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years, the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.\n\nKöppen climate classification\nThe Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.\nRain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000 mm (69 and 79 in). A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with rainfall between 750 and 1,270 mm (30 and 50 in) a year. They are widespread on Africa, and are also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia. The humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones. Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between latitudes 20° and 40° degrees away from the equator.\nAn oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.\n\nPollution\nMeasurement\nGauges\nRain is measured in units of length per unit time, typically in millimeters per hour, or in countries where imperial units are more common, inches per hour. The \"length\", or more accurately, \"depth\" being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat, horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time, typically an hour. One millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.\nThe standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by 25 mm (0.98 in) of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25 mm (0.0098 in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25 mm (0.0098 in) markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.\nWhen a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as CoCoRAHS or GLOBE. If a network is not available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement.\n\nRemote sensing\nOne of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for hydrological purposes. For instance, river flood control, sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data. Radar-derived rainfall estimates complement surface station data which can be used for calibration. To produce radar accumulations, rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points. A radar equation is then used, which is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Z\n        =\n        A\n        \n          R\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Z=AR^{b},}\n  \n\nwhere Z represents the radar reflectivity, R represents the rainfall rate, and A and b are constants.\nSatellite-derived rainfall estimates use passive microwave instruments aboard polar orbiting as well as geostationary weather satellites to indirectly measure rainfall rates. If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.\n\nIntensity\nRainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation, which depends on the considered time. The following categories are used to classify rainfall intensity:\n\nLight rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per hour\nModerate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5–7.6 mm (0.098–0.299 in) or 10 mm (0.39 in) per hour\nHeavy rain — when the precipitation rate is > 7.6 mm (0.30 in) per hour, or between 10 and 50 mm (0.39 and 1.97 in) per hour\nViolent rain — when the precipitation rate is > 50 mm (2.0 in) per hour\nTerms used for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer, trash-mover and toad-strangler.\nThe intensity can also be expressed by rainfall erosivity R-factor or in terms of the rainfall time-structure n-index.\n\nReturn period\nThe average time between occurrences of an event with a specified intensity and duration is called the return period. The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location. The return period is often expressed as an n-year event. For instance, a 10-year storm describes a rare rainfall event occurring on average once every 10 years. The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. A 100-year storm describes an extremely rare rainfall event occurring on average once in a century. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding worse than a 10-year event. The probability of an event in any year is the inverse of the return period (assuming the probability remains the same for each year). For instance, a 10-year storm has a probability of occurring of 10 percent in any given year, and a 100-year storm occurs with a 1 percent probability in a year. As with all probability events, it is possible, though improbable, to have multiple 100-year storms in a single year.\n\nForecasting\nThe Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States.\nForecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7 hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.\n\nImpact\nAgricultural\nPrecipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on agriculture. All plants need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.\nIn areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested through the use of rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.\n\nCulture and religion\nCultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world. In temperate climates, people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.\n\nRain holds an important religious significance in many cultures. The ancient Sumerians believed that rain was the semen of the sky god An, which fell from the heavens to inseminate his consort, the earth goddess Ki, causing her to give birth to all the plants of the earth. The Akkadians believed that the clouds were the breasts of Anu's consort Antu and that rain was milk from her breasts. According to Jewish tradition, in the first century BC, the Jewish miracle-worker Honi ha-M'agel ended a three-year drought in Judaea by drawing a circle in the sand and praying for rain, refusing to leave the circle until his prayer was granted. In his Meditations, the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius preserves a prayer for rain made by the Athenians to the Greek sky god Zeus. Various Native American tribes are known to have historically conducted rain dances in effort to encourage rainfall. Rainmaking rituals are also important in many African cultures. In the present-day United States, various state governors have held Days of Prayer for rain, including the Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas in 2011.\n\nGlobal climatology\nApproximately 505,000 km3 (121,000 cu mi) of water falls as precipitation each year across the globe with 398,000 km3 (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans. Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 mm (39 in). Deserts are defined as areas with an average annual precipitation of less than 250 mm (10 in) per year, or as areas where more water is lost by evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation.\n\nDeserts\nThe northern half of Africa is dominated by the world's most extensive hot, dry region, the Sahara Desert. Some deserts also occupy much of southern Africa: the Namib and the Kalahari. Across Asia, a large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west-southwest through western Pakistan (Balochistan) and Iran into the Arabian Desert in Saudi Arabia. Most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, making it the world's driest inhabited continent. In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desert-like climate just downwind across western Argentina. The drier areas of the United States are regions where the Sonoran Desert overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin, and central Wyoming.\n\nPolar deserts\nSince rain only falls as liquid, it rarely falls when surface temperatures are below freezing unless there is a layer of warm air aloft, in which case it becomes freezing rain. Due to the entire atmosphere being below freezing, frigid climates usually see very little rainfall and are often known as polar deserts. A common biome in this area is the tundra, which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.\n\nRainforests\nRainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall. Both tropical and temperate rainforests exist. Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet, mainly along the equator. Most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude but are often found in other areas.\nAround 40–75% of all biotic life is found in rainforests. Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover.\n\nMonsoons\nThe equatorial region near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or monsoon trough, is the wettest portion of the world's continents. Annually, the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by August, then moves back southward into the Southern Hemisphere by February and March. Within Asia, rainfall is favored across its southern portion from India east and northeast across the Philippines and southern China into Japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the Indian Ocean into the region. The monsoon trough can reach as far north as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August before moving southward after that. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon, which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure (a thermal low) over the warmest part of Asia. Similar, but weaker, monsoon circulations are present over North America and Australia.\nDuring the summer, the Southwest monsoon combined with Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the Atlantic Ocean brings the promise of afternoon and evening thunderstorms to the southern tier of the United States as well as the Great Plains. The eastern half of the contiguous United States east of the 98th meridian, the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, and the Sierra Nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation, with average rainfall exceeding 760 mm (30 in) per year. Tropical cyclones enhance precipitation across southern sections of the United States, as well as Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.\n\nImpact of the Westerlies\nWesterly flow from the mild North Atlantic leads to wetness across western Europe, in particular Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the western coasts can receive between 1,000 mm (39 in), at sea level and 2,500 mm (98 in), on the mountains of rain per year. Bergen, Norway is one of the more famous European rain-cities with its yearly precipitation of 2,250 mm (89 in) on average. During the fall, winter, and spring, Pacific storm systems bring most of Hawaii and the western United States much of their precipitation. Over the top of the ridge, the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the Great Lakes. Large thunderstorm areas known as mesoscale convective complexes move through the Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes during the warm season, contributing up to 10% of the annual precipitation to the region.\nThe El Niño-Southern Oscillation affects the precipitation distribution by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States, Midwest, the Southeast, and throughout the tropics. There is also evidence that global warming leads to increased precipitation in the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in the tropics and subtropics.\n\nWettest known locations\nCherrapunji, situated on the southern slopes of the Eastern Himalaya in Shillong, India is the confirmed wettest place on Earth, with an average annual rainfall of 11,430 mm (450 in). The highest recorded rainfall in a single year was 22,987 mm (905.0 in) in 1861. The 38-year average at nearby Mawsynram, Meghalaya, India is 11,873 mm (467.4 in). The wettest spot in Australia is Mount Bellenden Ker in the north-east of the country which records an average of 8,000 mm (310 in) per year, with over 12,200 mm (480.3 in) of rain recorded during 2000. The Big Bog on the island of Maui has the highest average annual rainfall in the Hawaiian Islands, at 10,300 mm (404 in). Mount Waiʻaleʻale on the island of Kauaʻi achieves similar torrential rains, while slightly lower than that of the Big Bog, at 9,500 mm (373 in) of rain per year over the last 32 years, with a record 17,340 mm (683 in) in 1982. Its summit is considered one of the rainiest spots on earth, with a reported 350 days of rain per year. \nLloró, a town situated in Chocó, Colombia, is probably the place with the largest rainfall in the world, averaging 13,300 mm (523.6 in) per year. The Department of Chocó is extraordinarily humid. Tutunendaó, a small town situated in the same department, is one of the wettest estimated places on Earth, averaging 11,394 mm (448.6 in) per year; in 1974 the town received 26,303 mm (86 ft 3.6 in), the largest annual rainfall measured in Colombia. Unlike Cherrapunji, which receives most of its rainfall between April and September, Tutunendaó receives rain almost uniformly distributed throughout the year. Quibdó, the capital of Chocó, receives the most rain in the world among cities with over 100,000 inhabitants: 9,000 mm (354 in) per year. Storms in Chocó can drop 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall in a day. This amount is more than what falls in many cities in a year.\n\nSee also\nNotes\na b c  The value given is the continent's highest, and possibly the world's, depending on measurement practices, procedures and period of record variations.\n^  The official greatest average annual precipitation for South America is 900 cm (354 in) at Quibdó, Colombia.

        "content": "The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant cat species in the genus Panthera. It has a pale yellowish to dark golden fur with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its body is slender and muscular reaching a length of 92–183 cm (36–72 in) with a 66–102 cm (26–40 in) long tail and a shoulder height of 60–70 cm (24–28 in). Males typically weigh 30.9–72 kg (68–159 lb), and females 20.5–43 kg (45–95 lb).\nThe leopard was first described in 1758, and several subspecies were proposed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, eight subspecies are recognised in its wide range in Africa and Asia. It initially evolved in Africa during the Early Pleistocene, before migrating into Eurasia around the Early–Middle Pleistocene transition. Leopards were formerly present across Europe, but became extinct in the region at around the end of the Late Pleistocene-early Holocene.\nThe leopard is adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. It is an opportunistic predator, hunting mostly ungulates and primates. It relies on its spotted pattern for camouflage as it stalks and ambushes its prey, which it sometimes drags up a tree. It is a solitary animal outside the mating season and when raising cubs. Females usually give birth to a litter of 2–4 cubs once in 15–24 months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at the age 2–2.5 years.\nListed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, leopard populations are currently threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. Leopards have had cultural roles in Ancient Greece, West Africa and modern Western culture. Leopard skins are popular in fashion.\n\nEtymology\nThe English name \"leopard\" comes from Old French leupart or Middle French liepart, that derives from Latin leopardus and ancient Greek λέοπάρδος (leopardos). Leopardos could be a compound of λέων (leōn), meaning 'lion', and πάρδος (pardos), meaning 'spotted'. The word λέοπάρδος originally referred to a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus).\n\"Panther\" is another common name, derived from Latin panther and ancient Greek πάνθηρ (pánthēr); The generic name Panthera originates in Latin panthera, a hunting net for catching wild beasts to be used by the Romans in combats. Pardus is the masculine singular form.\n\nTaxonomy\nFelis pardus was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.\nThe generic name Panthera was first used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who included all the known spotted cats into this group.\nOken's classification was not widely accepted, and Felis or Leopardus was used as the generic name until the early 20th century.\nThe leopard was designated as the type species of Panthera by Joel Asaph Allen in 1902.\nIn 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (P. tigris), lion (P. leo), and jaguar (P. onca) to Panthera.\n\nLiving subspecies\nFollowing Linnaeus' first description, 27 leopard subspecies were proposed by naturalists between 1794 and 1956. Since 1996, only eight subspecies have been considered valid on the basis of mitochondrial analysis. Later analysis revealed a ninth valid subspecies, the Arabian leopard.\nIn 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the following eight subspecies as valid taxa:\n\nResults of an analysis of molecular variance and pairwise fixation index of 182 African leopard museum specimens showed that some African leopards exhibit higher genetic differences than Asian leopard subspecies.\n\nEvolution\nResults of phylogenetic studies based on nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the last common ancestor of the Panthera and Neofelis genera is thought to have lived about 6.37 million years ago. Neofelis diverged about 8.66 million years ago from the Panthera lineage. The tiger diverged about 6.55 million years ago, followed by the snow leopard about 4.63 million years ago and the leopard about 4.35 million years ago. The leopard is a sister taxon to a clade within Panthera, consisting of the lion and the jaguar.\nResults of a phylogenetic analysis of chemical secretions amongst cats indicated that the leopard is closely related to the lion.\nThe geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia. The leopard-lion clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene. The leopard-lion clade diverged 3.1–1.95 million years ago. Additionally, a 2016 study revealed that the mitochondrial genomes of the leopard, lion and snow leopard are more similar to each other than their nuclear genomes, indicating that their ancestors hybridized with the snow leopard at some point in their evolution.\nThe oldest unambiguous fossils of the leopard are from Eastern Africa, dating to around 2 million years ago.\nLeopard-like fossil bones and teeth possibly dating to the Pliocene were excavated in Perrier in France, northeast of London, and in Valdarno, Italy. Until 1940, similar fossils dating back to the Pleistocene were excavated mostly in loess and caves at 40 sites in Europe, including Furninha Cave near Lisbon, Genista Caves in Gibraltar, and Santander Province in northern Spain to several sites across France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, in the north up to Derby in England, in the east to Přerov in the Czech Republic and the Baranya in southern Hungary.\nLeopards arrived in Eurasia during the late Early to Middle Pleistocene around 1.2 to 0.6 million years ago.\nFour European Pleistocene leopard subspecies were proposed. P. p. begoueni from the beginning of the Early Pleistocene was replaced about 0.6 million years ago by P. p. sickenbergi, which in turn was replaced by P. p. antiqua around 0.3 million years ago. P. p. spelaea is the most recent subspecies that appeared at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene and survived until about 11,000 years ago and possibly into the early Holocene in the Iberian Peninsula.\nLeopards depicted in cave paintings in Chauvet Cave provide indirect evidence of leopard presence in Europe.\nLeopard fossils dating to the Late Pleistocene were found in Biśnik Cave in south-central Poland.\nFossil remains were also excavated in the Iberian and Italian Peninsula, and in the Balkans.\nLeopard fossils dating to the Pleistocene were also excavated in the Japanese archipelago. Leopard fossils were also found in Taiwan.\n\nHybrids\nIn 1953, a male leopard and a female lion were crossbred in Hanshin Park in Nishinomiya, Japan. Their offspring known as a leopon was born in 1959 and 1961, all cubs were spotted and bigger than a juvenile leopard. Attempts to mate a leopon with a tigress proved unsuccessful.\n\nCharacteristics\nThe leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back. Its skin colour varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its underbelly is white and its ringed tail is shorter than its body. Its pupils are round. Leopards living in arid regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living in forests and mountains are much darker and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the legs. Rosettes are circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates, and dark golden in rainforest habitats. Rosette patterns are unique in each individual. This pattern is thought to be an adaptation to dense vegetation with patchy shadows, where it serves as camouflage.\nIts white-tipped tail is about 60–100 cm (23.6–39.4 in) long, white underneath and with spots that form incomplete bands toward the end of the tail.\nThe guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) in face and head, and increase in length toward the flanks and the belly to about 25–30 mm (1.0–1.2 in). Juveniles have woolly fur that appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots. \nIts fur tends to grow longer in colder climates.\nThe leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker and with smaller spots inside. The leopard has a diploid chromosome number of 38.\nMelanistic leopards are also known as black panthers. Melanism in leopards is caused by a recessive allele and is inherited as a recessive trait.\nIn India, nine pale and white leopards were reported between 1905 and 1967.\nLeopards exhibiting erythrism were recorded between 1990 and 2015 in South Africa's Madikwe Game Reserve and in Mpumalanga. The cause of this morph known as a \"strawberry leopard\" or \"pink panther\" is not well understood.\n\nSize\nThe leopard is a slender and muscular cat, with relatively short limbs and a broad head. It is sexually dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females. Males stand 60–70 cm (24–28 in) at the shoulder, while females are 57–64 cm (22–25 in) tall. The head-and-body length ranges between 92 and 183 cm (36 and 72 in) with a 66 to 102 cm (26 to 40 in) long tail. Sizes vary geographically. Males typically weigh 30.9–72 kg (68–159 lb), and females 20.5–43 kg (45–95 lb). Occasionally, large males can grow up to 91 kg (201 lb). Leopards from the Cape Province in South Africa are generally smaller, reaching only 20–45 kg (44–99 lb) in males.\nThe heaviest wild leopard in Southern Africa weighed around 96 kg (212 lb), and it measured 262 cm (103 in). In 2016, an Indian leopard killed in Himachal Pradesh measured 261 cm (103 in) with an estimated weight of 78.5 kg (173 lb); it was perhaps the largest known wild leopard in India.\nThe largest recorded skull of a leopard was found in India in 1920 and measured 28 cm (11 in) in basal length, 20 cm (7.9 in) in breadth, and weighed 1 kg (2.2 lb). The skull of an African leopard measured 286 mm (11.3 in) in basal length, and 181 mm (7.1 in) in breadth, and weighed 790 g (28 oz).\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe leopard has the largest distribution of all wild cats, occurring widely in Africa and Asia, although populations are fragmented and declining. It inhabits foremost savanna and rainforest, and areas where grasslands, woodlands and riparian forests remain largely undisturbed. It also persists in urban environments, if it is not persecuted, has sufficient prey and patches of vegetation for shelter during the day.\nThe leopard's range in West Africa is estimated to have drastically declined by 95%, and in the Sahara desert by 97%. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is still numerous and surviving in marginal habitats where other large cats have disappeared. In southeastern Egypt, an individual found killed in 2017 was the first sighting of the leopard in this area in 65 years.\nIn West Asia, the leopard inhabits remain in the areas of southern and southeastern Anatolia.\nLeopard populations in the Arabian Peninsula are small and fragmented.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the leopard is still relatively abundant, with greater numbers than those of other Panthera species. Some leopard populations in India live quite close to human settlements and even in semi-developed areas. Although adaptable to human disturbances, leopards require healthy prey populations and appropriate vegetative cover for hunting for prolonged survival and thus rarely linger in heavily developed areas. Due to the leopard's stealth, people often remain unaware that it lives in nearby areas. As of 2020, the leopard population within forested habitats in India's tiger range landscapes was estimated at 12,172 to 13,535 individuals. Surveyed landscapes included elevations below 2,600 m (8,500 ft)  in the Shivalik Hills and Gangetic plains, Central India and Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, the Brahmaputra River basin and hills in Northeast India.\nIn Nepal's Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, a melanistic leopard was photographed at an elevation of 4,300 m (14,100 ft) by a camera trap in May 2012.\nIn Sri Lanka, leopards were recorded in Yala National Park and in unprotected forest patches, tea estates, grasslands, home gardens, pine and eucalyptus plantations.\nIn Myanmar, leopards were recorded for the first time by camera traps in the hill forests of Myanmar's Karen State. The Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex in southern Myanmar is considered a leopard stronghold. In Thailand, leopards are present in the Western Forest Complex, Kaeng Krachan-Kui Buri, Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok protected area complexes and in Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary bordering Malaysia. In Peninsular Malaysia, leopards are present in Belum-Temengor, Taman Negara and Endau-Rompin National Parks.\nIn Laos, leopards were recorded in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Nam Kan National Protected Area.\nIn Cambodia, leopards inhabit deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest.\nIn southern China, leopards were recorded only in the Qinling Mountains during surveys in 11 nature reserves between 2002 and 2009.\nIn Java, leopards inhabit dense tropical rainforests and dry deciduous forests at elevations from sea level to 2,540 m (8,330 ft). Outside protected areas, leopards were recorded in mixed agricultural land, secondary forest and production forest between 2008 and 2014.\nIn the Russian Far East, it inhabits temperate coniferous forests where winter temperatures reach a low of −25 °C (−13 °F).\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe leopard is a solitary and territorial animal. It is typically shy and alert when crossing roadways and encountering oncoming vehicles, but may be emboldened to attack people or other animals when threatened. Adults associate only in the mating season. Females continue to interact with their offspring even after weaning and have been observed sharing kills with their offspring when they can not obtain any prey. They produce a number of vocalizations, including growls, snarls, meows, and purrs. Cubs call their mother with an urr-urr sound. The most notable vocalization is the 'sawing' roar, which consists of deep, repeated strokes. This likely functions in establishing territories and attracting mates.\nThe whitish spots on the back of its ears are thought to play a role in communication.\nIt has been hypothesized that the white tips of their tails may function as a 'follow-me' signal in intraspecific communication. However, no significant association were found between a conspicuous colour of tail patches and behavioural variables in carnivores.\nLeopards are mainly active from dusk till dawn and will rest for most of the day and some hours at night in thickets, among rocks or over tree branches. Leopards have been observed walking 1–25 km (0.62–15.53 mi) across their range at night; wandering up to 75 km (47 mi) if disturbed. In some regions, they are nocturnal. In western African forests, they have been observed to be largely diurnal and hunting during twilight, when their prey animals are active; activity patterns vary between seasons.\nLeopards can climb trees quite skillfully, often resting on tree branches and descending headfirst.\nThey can run at over 58 km/h (36 mph; 16 m/s), leap over 6 m (20 ft) horizontally, and jump up to 3 m (9.8 ft) vertically.\n\nSocial spacing\nIn Kruger National Park, most leopards tend to keep 1 km (0.62 mi) apart. Males occasionally interact with their partners and cubs, and exceptionally this can extend beyond to two generations. Aggressive encounters are rare, typically limited to defending territories from intruders. In a South African reserve, a male was wounded in a male–male territorial battle over a carcass.\nMales occupy home ranges that often overlap with a few smaller female home ranges, probably as a strategy to enhance access to females. In the Ivory Coast, the home range of a female was completely enclosed within a male's. Females live with their cubs in home ranges that overlap extensively, probably due to the association between mothers and their offspring. There may be a few other fluctuating home ranges belonging to young individuals. It is not clear if male home ranges overlap as much as those of females do. Individuals try to drive away intruders of the same sex.\nA study of leopards in the Namibian farmlands showed that the size of home ranges was not significantly affected by sex, rainfall patterns or season; the higher the prey availability in an area, the greater the leopard population density and the smaller the size of home ranges, but they tend to expand if there is human interference.\nSizes of home ranges vary geographically and depending on habitat and availability of prey. In the Serengeti, males have home ranges of 33–38 km2 (13–15 sq mi) and females of 14–16 km2 (5.4–6.2 sq mi); but males in northeastern Namibia of 451 km2 (174 sq mi) and females of 188 km2 (73 sq mi). They are even larger in arid and montane areas. In Nepal's Bardia National Park, male home ranges of 48 km2 (19 sq mi) and female ones of 5–7 km2 (1.9–2.7 sq mi) are smaller than those generally observed in Africa.\n\nHunting and diet\nThe leopard is a carnivore that prefers medium-sized prey with a body mass ranging from 10–40 kg (22–88 lb). Prey species in this weight range tend to occur in dense habitat and to form small herds. Species that prefer open areas and have well-developed anti-predator strategies are less preferred. More than 100 prey species have been recorded. The most preferred species are ungulates, such as impala, bushbuck, common duiker and chital. Primates preyed upon include white-eyelid mangabeys, guenons and gray langurs. Leopards also kill smaller carnivores like black-backed jackal, bat-eared fox, genet and cheetah. In urban environments, domestic dogs provide an important food source. The largest prey killed by a leopard was reportedly a male eland weighing 900 kg (2,000 lb). A study in Wolong National Nature Reserve in southern China demonstrated variation in the leopard's diet over time; over the course of seven years, the vegetative cover receded, and leopards opportunistically shifted from primarily consuming tufted deer to pursuing bamboo rats and other smaller prey.\nThe leopard depends mainly on its acute senses of hearing and vision for hunting. It primarily hunts at night in most areas. In western African forests and Tsavo National Park, they have also been observed hunting by day. They usually hunt on the ground. In the Serengeti, they have been seen to ambush prey by descending on it from trees. It stalks its prey and tries to approach as closely as possible, typically within 5 m (16 ft) of the target, and, finally, pounces on it and kills it by suffocation. It kills small prey with a bite to the back of the neck, but holds larger animals by the throat and strangles them. It caches kills up to 2 km (1.2 mi) apart. It is able to take large prey due to its powerful jaw muscles, and is therefore strong enough to drag carcasses heavier than itself up into trees; an individual was seen to haul a young giraffe weighing nearly 125 kg (276 lb) up 5.7 m (18 ft 8 in) into a tree. It eats small prey immediately, but drags larger carcasses over several hundred metres and caches it safely in trees, bushes or even caves; this behaviour allows the leopard to store its prey away from rivals, and offers it an advantage over them. The way it stores the kill depends on local topography and individual preferences, varying from trees in Kruger National Park to bushes in the plain terrain of the Kalahari.\nAverage daily consumption rates of 3.5 kg (7 lb 11 oz) were estimated for males and of 2.8 kg (6 lb 3 oz) for females. In the southern Kalahari Desert, leopards meet their water requirements by the bodily fluids of prey and succulent plants; they drink water every two to three days and feed infrequently on moisture-rich plants such as gemsbok cucumbers, watermelon and Kalahari sour grass.\n\nEnemies and competitors\nAcross its range, the leopard coexists with a number of other large predators. In Africa, it is part of a large predator guild with lions, cheetahs, spotted and brown hyenas, and African wild dogs. The leopard is dominant only over the cheetah while the others have the advantage of size, pack numbers or both. Lions pose a great mortal threat and can be responsible for 22% of leopard deaths in Sabi Sand Game Reserve. Spotted hyenas are less threatening but are more likely to steal kills, being the culprits of up to 50% of stolen leopard kills in the same area. To counter this, leopards store their kills in the trees and out of reach. Lions have a high success rate in fetching leopard kills from trees. Leopards do not seem to actively avoid their competitors but rather difference in prey and habitat preferences appear to limit their spatial overlap. In particular, leopards use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions are present in an area and both cats are active at the same time of day. \nIn Asia, the leopard's main competitors are tigers and dholes. Both the larger tiger and pack-living dhole dominate leopards during encounters. Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing. Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of the forest while leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes. The three predators coexist by hunting different sized prey. In Nagarhole National Park, the average size for a leopard kill was 37.6 kg (83 lb) compared to 91.5 kg (202 lb) for tigers and 43.4 kg (96 lb) for dholes. At Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to feed on favoured prey while leopards and dholes had to increase their consumption of small prey. Leopards can live successfully in tiger habitat when there is abundant food and vegetation cover. Otherwise, they appear to be less common where tigers are numerous. The recovery of the tiger population in Rajaji National Park during the 2000s led to a reduction in leopard population densities.\n\nReproduction and life cycle\nIn some areas, leopards mate all year round. In Manchuria and Siberia, they mate during January and February. On average, females begin to breed between the ages of 2½ and three, and males between the ages of two and three. The female's estrous cycle lasts about 46 days, and she is usually in heat for 6–7 days. Gestation lasts for 90 to 105 days. Cubs are usually born in a litter of 2–4 cubs. The mortality rate of cubs is estimated at 41–50% during the first year. Predators are the biggest cause for leopard cub mortality during their first year. Male leopards are known to cause infanticide, in order to bring the female back into heat. Intervals between births average 15 to 24 months, but can be shorter, depending on the survival of the cubs.\nFemales give birth in a cave, crevice among boulders, hollow tree or thicket. Newborn cubs weigh 280–1,000 g (9.9–35.3 oz), and are born with closed eyes, which open four to nine days after birth. The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults. Their pelage is also more gray in colour with less defined spots. They begin to eat meat at around nine weeks. Around three months of age, the young begin to follow the mother on hunts. At one year of age, cubs can probably fend for themselves, but will remain with the mother for 18–24 months. After separating from their mother, sibling cubs may travel together for months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at 2–2⅓ years.\nThe generation length of the leopard is 9.3 years.\nThe average life span of a leopard is 12–17 years. \nThe oldest leopard was a captive female that died at the age of 24 years, 2 months and 13 days.\n\nConservation\nThe leopard is listed on CITES Appendix I, and hunting is banned in Botswana and Afghanistan; in 11 sub-Saharan countries, trade is restricted to skins and body parts of 2,560 individuals.\nIn 2007, a leopard reintroduction programme was initiated in the Russian Caucasus, where captive bred individuals are reared and trained in 0.5–0.9 ha (1.2–2.2 acres) large enclosures in Sochi National Park; six individuals released into Caucasus Nature Reserve and Alaniya National Park in 2018 survived as of February 2022.\n\nThreats\nThe leopard is primarily threatened by habitat fragmentation and conversion of forest to agriculturally used land, which lead to a declining natural prey base, human–wildlife conflict with livestock herders and high leopard mortality rates. It is also threatened by trophy hunting and poaching. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical range.\nBetween 2002 and 2012, at least four leopards were estimated to have been poached per week in India for the illegal wildlife trade of its skins and bones.\nIn spring 2013, 37 leopard skins were found during a 7-week long market survey in major Moroccan cities. In 2014, 43 leopard skins were detected during two surveys in Morocco. Vendors admitted to have imported skins from sub-Saharan Africa.\nSurveys in the Central African Republic's Chinko area revealed that the leopard population decreased from 97 individuals in 2012 to 50 individuals in 2017. In this period, transhumant pastoralists from the border area with Sudan moved in the area with their livestock. Rangers confiscated large amounts of poison in the camps of livestock herders who were accompanied by armed merchants. They engaged in poaching large herbivores, sale of bushmeat and trading leopard skins in Am Dafok.\nIn Java, the leopard is threatened by illegal hunting and trade. Between 2011 and 2019, body parts of 51 Javan leopards were seized including six live individuals, 12 skins, 13 skulls, 20 canines and 22 claws.\n\nHuman relations\nCultural significance\nLeopards have been featured in art, mythology and folklore of many countries. In Greek mythology, it was a symbol of the god Dionysus, who was depicted wearing leopard skin and using leopards as means of transportation. In one myth, the god was captured by pirates but two leopards rescued him. Numerous Roman mosaics from North African sites depict fauna now found only in tropical Africa. During the Benin Empire, the leopard was commonly represented on engravings and sculptures and was used to symbolise the power of the king or oba, since the leopard was considered the king of the forest. The Ashanti people also used the leopard as a symbol of leadership, and only the king was permitted to have a ceremonial leopard stool. Some African cultures considered the leopard to be a smarter, better hunter than the lion and harder to kill.\nIn Rudyard Kipling's \"How the Leopard Got His Spots\", one of his Just So Stories, a leopard with no spots in the Highveld lives with his hunting partner, the Ethiopian. When they set off to the forest, the Ethiopian changed his brown skin, and the leopard painted spots on his skin. A leopard played an important role in the 1938 Hollywood film Bringing Up Baby. African chiefs, European queens, Hollywood actors and burlesque dancers wore coats made of leopard skins.\nThe leopard is a frequently used motif in heraldry, most commonly as passant. The heraldic leopard lacks spots and sports a mane, making it visually almost identical to the heraldic lion, and the two are often used interchangeably. Naturalistic leopard-like depictions appear on the coat of arms of Benin, Malawi, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon, the last of which uses a black panther.\n\nAttacks on people\nThe Leopard of Rudraprayag killed more than 125 people; the Panar Leopard was thought to have killed over 400 people. Both were shot by British hunter Jim Corbett. The spotted devil of Gummalapur killed about 42 people in Karnataka, India.\n\nIn captivity\nThe ancient Romans kept leopards in captivity to be slaughtered in hunts as well as execute criminals. In Benin, leopards were kept and paraded as mascots, totems and sacrifices to deities. Several leopards were kept in a menagerie originally established by King John of England at the Tower of London in the 13th century; around 1235, three of these animals were given to Henry III by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In modern times, leopards have been trained and tamed in circuses.\n\nSee also\nLeopard pattern\nList of largest cats\nPanther (legendary creature)\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAllsen, Thomas T.

        "streamer": "HERA",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera",
        "content": "In ancient Greek religion, Hera (; Ancient Greek: Ἥρα, romanized: Hḗrā; Ἥρη, Hḗrē in Ionic and Homeric Greek) is the goddess of marriage, women, and family, and the protector of women during childbirth. In Greek mythology, she is queen of the twelve Olympians and Mount Olympus, sister and wife of Zeus, and daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. One of her defining characteristics in myth is her jealous and vengeful nature in dealing with any who offended her, especially Zeus's numerous adulterous lovers and illegitimate offspring.\nHer iconography usually presents her as a dignified, matronly figure, upright or enthroned, crowned with a polos or diadem, sometimes veiled as a married woman. She is the patron goddess of lawful marriage. She presides over weddings, blesses and legalises marital unions, and protects women from harm during childbirth. Her sacred animals include the cow, cuckoo, and peacock. She is sometimes shown holding a pomegranate as an emblem of immortality. Her Roman counterpart is Juno.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Hera (Hēra or Hērē) has several possible and mutually exclusive etymologies. One possibility is to connect it with Greek ὥρα hōra, season, and to interpret it as ripe for marriage and according to Plato ἐρατή eratē, \"beloved\" as Zeus is said to have married her for love. According to Plutarch, Hera was an allegorical name and an anagram of aēr (ἀήρ, \"air\"). So begins the section on Hera in Walter Burkert's Greek Religion. In a note, he records other scholars' arguments \"for the meaning Mistress as a feminine to Heros, Master\", with uncertain origin. John Chadwick, a decipherer of Linear B, remarks \"her name may be connected with hērōs, ἥρως, 'hero', but that is no help since it too is etymologically obscure.\" A. J. van Windekens, offers \"young cow, heifer\", which is consonant with Hera's common epithet βοῶπις (boōpis, \"cow-eyed\"). R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin. Her name is attested in Mycenaean Greek written in the Linear B syllabic script as 𐀁𐀨 e-ra, appearing on tablets found in Pylos and Thebes, as well as in the Cypriotic dialect in the dative e-ra-i.\nThe PIE... could be originally either (a) 'the female who is attached/coupled' or (b) 'the female who attaches herself'... both socially and physically or emotionally.\"\nMany theophoric names such as Heracles, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Herodicus, derive from Hera.\n\nEpithets\nHera bore several epithets in the mythological tradition and in literature. In the historical times the majority of the Greeks recognized Hera as the consort of Zeus. Hera is the protector of marriage and of the rights of the married women. In some cults she has some functions of the earth goddess. She is occasionally related to warfare as tutelary goddess.\n\nGoddess of marriage and bride\nConsort of Zeus\nFounder and protector\nAs an earth and fertility goddess\nAs goddess of the hymns\nPlace of worship\nWarlike character\nLocal cults\nOrigins\nIn historical times, the majority of the Greeks recognized Hera as the consort of Zeus. Zeus was the protector of rights and mores, and his partner Hera became the protector of legal marriage and the rights of married women . Hera emerged from a form of the \"Mycenean goddess of the palace\" and became the spouse of Zeus. Modern scholars suggest that Hera is not only the Olympian sky-goddess, but in some cults she may be identified with the earth-goddess. Her ancient connection with her sacred animal, the cow, still existed in historical times. She is probably related to Near-Eastern forms of cow-goddesses such as Hathor or Bat. The Greek earth-goddess Gaia is occasionally identified with Hera. Gaia may be related to the Vedic earth-goddess Prithvi, who was also associated with the cow.\n\nMycenean Greece\nAn inscription in Linear B on a tablet found at Pylos  mentions offerings \"to Zeus-Hera-Drimios\".(Drimios is the son of Zeus) . Hera was the tutelary goddess of Argos and it is possible that she had Mycenean origin. Martin P. Nilsson suggested that Hera is mainly the \"Argeiē\" (Ἀργείη), a name given by Homer which describes her not as Greek, but as an Argive goddess. She is the protectress of the citadel. In literature Argos is called \"dōma Hēras\" (the house of Hera)  and the Argives are called her people by Pindar. Homer in Iliad uses the formula \"boōpis potnia Hērē)\" (cow-eyed, mistress Hera), which probably relates her to a form of the Mediterranean goddess of nature. The epithet Qo-wi-ja ( boōpis) appears in a Linear B inscription. Walter Burkert notices that it is difficult to confirm that the epithet \"bowpis\" corresponds to a Greek belief. However it is possible that  Hera was conceived as a cow in her archaic cults.\n\nConsort of Zeus\nHera exists as a spouse of Zeus and their \"sacred marriage\" was celebrated in many Greek festivals in a processional ceremony from ancient times. The myth of the premarital approach of Hera by Zeus is early mentioned by Homer . It is possible that the myth has its origins to an old custom of the European country  population, the premarital intercourse of the engaged couple. According to Walter Burkert the  \"Mediterranean goddess of nature\" becomes the bride of the Greek sky-god. He notices that \"the disappearance and retrieval of Hera has parallels with other fertility cults\" . Hera was originally a goddess of fertility in her fest \"Toneia\" at Samos and at Knossos in Crete. At Samos the image of Hera was hidden  bounted in willows and the participants tried to discover it. At Knossos  Zeus is mating with the earth goddess (finally named Hera) in a very ancient ritual. In her festival Daedala at Plataia  there is an account of Hera's quarrel with Zeus and their reconciliation.\n\nNear-Eastern origin\nIn Crete the bull was associated with religious practices. In the legend of the Minotaur the Queen of Knossos is hidden inside an artificial hollow cow and she is mating with a bull-form god in a sacred ceremony. The hieros gamos indicates a ritual of fertility magic, which was probably introduced from Near East in the Aegean region. The \"hieros gamos\" of Zeus with the earth goddess (finally named Hera) was celebrated at  Knossos in Crete.  In Near East the solar-deity and the moon-goddess are often represented as a bull and a cow  and Roscher proposed that Hera was a moon-goddess. The combination feminine divinity-cow-moon is not unusual in Crete and Near East. The relationship of Hera with the cow still existed in the historical times and this probably relates her to Near-Eastern forms of cow-goddesses like Hathor (or Bat). The Egyptian sky-goddess Hathor is the consort of the sky-god Horus.\n\nIndo-european origin\nIn the Vedic tradition the earth-goddess Prithvi is the consort of the sky-god Dyaus and she is associated with the cow. Prithvi may be identified with the Greek goddess Gaia. Pherecydes of Syros in his cosmogony describes the mating of two divine principles: The marriage of Zas with  Chthonie. Geoffrey Kirk notices that after the marriage \"Cthonie\" becomes Ge who probably takes charge of the protection of marriage. Hera is occasionally identified with \"Ge\". In a fragment of Euripides the Aether of Zeus is the sky-god who is the father of men and gods, and the earth-goddess Ge is the mother of all life. It seems that Io the priestess of Hera at Argos and consort of Zeus, was another form of Hera. In a Greek myth \"Io\" is transformed into a cow . This seems to be correlated to how Homer in Iliad uses the formula \"boōpis potnia Hērē)\" (cow-eyed, mistress Hera), suggesting that they may have been syncretized.\n\nCult\nThe worship of Hera was sparse in Thessaly, Attica, Phocis and Achaea. In Boeotia she is related to the fest Daedala. The main center of her cult was North-Eastern Peloponnese, especially Argolis. ( Argos, Tiryns, Corinth, Sicyon, Epidaurus and Hermione). She was worshipped at the Arcadian cities  Mantineia, Megalopolis, Stymphalus and at Sparta. The oldest temple at Olympia belonged to Hera. In the islands she was worshipped at Samos, Paros, Delos, Amorgos, Thera, Kos, Rhodes and Crete. The island Euboea was considered her holy place. A month was named after Hera at Delphi (Heraios), Olous, Laconia, Tinos (Heraiōn), Pergamos (Heraos). Hera is the  Olympia, Queen, Anassa , the Queen of heaven. The royal quality of her was preserved by the monuments of Greek art.\nHera may have been the first deity to whom the Greeks dedicated an enclosed roofed temple sanctuary, at Samos about 800 BCE. It was replaced later by the Heraion of Samos, one of the largest of all Greek temples (altars were in front of the temples under the open sky). There were many temples built on this site, so the evidence is somewhat confusing, and archaeological dates are uncertain.\nThe temple created by the Rhoecus sculptors and architects was destroyed between 570 and 560 BCE. This was replaced by the Polycratean temple of 540–530 BCE. In one of these temples, we see a forest of 155 columns. There is also no evidence of tiles on this temple suggesting either the temple was never finished or that the temple was open to the sky.\nEarlier sanctuaries, whose dedication to Hera is less certain, were of the Mycenaean type called \"house sanctuaries\". Samos excavations have revealed votive offerings, many of them late 8th and 7th centuries BCE, which show that Hera at Samos was not merely a local Greek goddess of the Aegean. The museum there contains figures of gods and suppliants and other votive offerings from Armenia, Babylon, Iran, Assyria, and Egypt, testimony to the reputation which this sanctuary of Hera enjoyed, and the large influx of pilgrims. Compared to this mighty goddess, who also possessed the earliest temple at Olympia and two of the great fifth and sixth-century temples of Paestum, the termagant of Homer and the myths is an \"almost... comic figure,\" according to Burkert.\n\nThough the greatest and earliest free-standing temple to Hera was the Heraion of Samos, in the Greek mainland Hera was especially worshipped as \"Argive Hera\" (Hera Argeia) at her sanctuary that stood between the former Mycenaean city-states of Argos and Mycenae, where the festivals in her honor called Heraia were celebrated. \"The three cities I love best,\" she declares in the Iliad, book iv, \"are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets.\" There were also temples to Hera in Olympia, Corinth, Tiryns, Perachora and the sacred island of Delos. In Magna Graecia, two Doric temples to Hera were constructed at Paestum, about 550 BCE and about 450 BCE. One of them, long called the Temple of Poseidon was identified in the 1950s as a temple of Hera.\nThe Daedala fire festival on Cithaeron near Plataea, included an account of Hera's quarrel with Zeus and their reconciliation.\nHera's importance in the early archaic period is attested by the large building projects undertaken in her honor. The temples of Hera in the two main centers of her cult, the Heraion of Samos and the Heraion of Argos in the Argolis, were the very earliest monumental Greek temples constructed, in the 8th century BCE. At Argos the Dorian \"Heraion\" was built on the hill of Prosymna near Mycenean hero-tombs. At Samos the cult activity near the altar begun in late Mycenean period and a big altar was built in the 9th century BC.\nDuring the Hellenistic period (c. 330 BCE – 300 CE), Greek culture spread outside Greece across the Eastern Mediterranean region as a result of the conquests of Alexander the Great.  The Hellenistic religion was often syncretic, and the Greek gods were identified with local deities as different aspects or names of the same divinity.  Hera was identified with various local mother deities.  As an example, the work On the Syrian Goddess suggests a cult worshipped a goddess that was simultaneously the Syrian goddess Atargatis and Hera.  This even extended to early Christianity some; the Legend of Aphroditian identifies Hera with the Virgin Mary, perhaps due to one of Hera's abilities being her miraculous restoration of her own virginity.\n\nImportance\nAccording to Walter Burkert, both Hera and Demeter have many characteristic attributes of Pre-Greek Great Goddesses.\nIn the same vein, British scholar Charles Francis Keary suggests that Hera had some sort of \"Earth Goddess\" worship in ancient times, connected to her possible origin as a Pelasgian goddess (as mentioned by Herodotus). In Greece the Mediterranean goddess of nature  is the bride of the Greek sky-god . In her fest Daedala Hera is related to the nymph Plataia (consort of Zeus), an old forgotten form of the Greek earth-goddess. Plataia may be related to Gaia who is occasionally identified with Hera.\nAccording to Homeric Hymn II to Delian Apollo, Hera detained Eileithyia to prevent Leto from going into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since the father was Zeus. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos sent Iris to bring her. As she stepped upon the island, the divine birth began. In the myth of the birth of Heracles, it is Hera herself who sits at the door, delaying the birth of Heracles until her protégé, Eurystheus, had been born first.\nThe Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo makes the monster Typhaon the offspring of archaic Hera in her ancient form, produced out of herself, like a monstrous version of Hephaestus, and whelped in a cave in Cilicia. She gave the creature to Python to raise.\n\nIn the Temple of Hera, Olympia, Hera's seated cult figure was older than the warrior figure of Zeus that accompanied it. Homer expressed her relationship with Zeus delicately in the Iliad, in which she declares to Zeus, \"I am Cronus' eldest daughter, and am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king of the gods.\"\n\nMatriarchy\nThere has been considerable scholarship, reaching back to Johann Jakob Bachofen in the mid-nineteenth century, about the possibility that Hera, whose early importance in Greek religion is firmly established, was originally the goddess of a matriarchal people, presumably inhabiting Greece before the Hellenes. In this view, her activity as goddess of marriage established the patriarchal bond of her own subordination: her resistance to the conquests of Zeus is rendered as Hera's \"jealousy\", the main theme of literary anecdotes that undercut her ancient cult.\nHowever, it remains a controversial claim that an ancient matriarchy or a cultural focus on a monotheistic Great Goddess existed among the ancient Greeks or elsewhere. The claim is generally rejected by modern scholars as insufficiently evidenced. Walter Burkert notices that the ancient Kourotrophos figure is almost absent in Crete, and the nomination Mother Goddess was not the underlying principle in the Minoan religion.\n\nYouth\nHera was most known as the matron goddess, Hera Teleia, but she presided over weddings as well. In myth and cult, fragmentary references and archaic practices remain of the sacred marriage of Hera and Zeus. At Plataea, there was a sculpture of Hera seated as a bride by Callimachus, as well as the matronly standing Hera.\nHera was also worshipped as a virgin: there was a tradition in Stymphalia in Arcadia that there had been a triple shrine to Hera the Girl (Παις [Pais]), the Adult Woman (Τελεια [Teleia]), and the Separated (Χήρη [Chḗrē] 'Widowed' or 'Divorced'). In the region around Argos, the temple of Hera in Hermione near Argos was to Hera the Virgin. At the spring of Kanathos, close to Nauplia, Hera renewed her virginity annually, in rites that were not to be spoken of (arrheton). In her fire-festival Daedala at Plataia the puppet of the goddess was bathed in the river Asopos before the wedding ceremony. In the festival \"Toneia\" at Samos the image of the goddess was purified, bounted in willows and then probably hanged on a tree. Robert Graves interprets this as a representation of the new moon (Hebe), full moon (Hera), and old moon (Hecate), respectively personifying the Virgin (Spring), the Mother (Summer), and the destroying Crone (Autumn).\n\nFestivals\nThe marriage of Zeus with Hera is the main theme in most Greek festivals celebrated in honour of the goddess. In the cults of Hera the dances and rites are performed by young married women. These choral dances reenacted early myth and ritual. Burkert notices that \"the disappearing and retrieval of Hera in some cults has parallels with other fertility cults\". The Greek aetiological myths  (aitia) give a reasonable explanation of the ritual and replicate its structural form. This is accurate for \"aitia\" related to initiation rituals from youth to maturity. Ancient accounts refer to the retirement of Hera  after a quarell with Zeus. Hera's wrath may indicate the wrath and jealousy of the Greek wife. Other accounts refer to cultic trees or pillars. and rituals of the goddess of vegetation. Some accounts are related to rituals of the Bronze Age before the splitting of the \"Mistress of the animals\" into separate goddesses.\n\nArgos. During Hera's famous fest \"Hecatombaia\"(one hundred oxen) -or Argive \"Heraia\"-the priestess of Hera was carried on a chart drawn by white-heifers to the sanctuary. The festival included an armed procession of male citizens and the prize of the contest was a bronze shield. The Argive festival was a new year festival and the new male citizens introduced themselves in the community. It is not verified that the festival was originally a wedding processional ceremony. At Argos Hera controlled the seasonal goddesses Horae. Near the Heraion of Argos there was the stream \"Eleutherion\" (water of freedom). The priestess of Hera used it for purifications and the sacrifices were kept secret (aporrheta) \nPlataia in Boeotia. The festival Daedala of Hera was a fire festival. The citizens of Plataia maintained from prehistoric times the processional wedding ceremony. A puppet named Hera was married with Zeus. The puppet was washed in the river Asopos and it was carried on a cow-drawn chart to the top of Kithairon. There the puppet was burned together with other idols. Pausanias in the aetiological myth mentions the retirement of Hera after a quarrel with Zeus and their reconciliation. The nymph Plataia, consort of Zeus is an old form of the Greek earth-goddess and she may be related to Gaia.\nSamos.The name of the island was \"Parthenia\" in the Carian period. In the Samian festival \"Toneia\", Hera was originally a goddess of fertility. The festival included initiation rites of girls and probably boys from youth to maturity. At the beginning of the festival a xoanon of Hera was carried on a plank to the sea and then back to the coast. This custom reminds the cult of the Hittite-Hurrian  god of fertility Telepinu. In the aetiological myth of Menedotus the image of Hera was bathed, bounted in willows and finally hidden (or hanged). The participants tried to find it. Zeus was absent, and the processional wedding ceremony was introduced later.\nCorinth. Hera-Acraea was the protectress of the castle. The Corinthian \"Heraia\" was a mourning festival. Hera is related to Medea (the wife of Jason) a foreign goddess who was introduced in Greece. In the myth of the Argonauts Hera is the protectress of Jason. The scholiast of Euripides suggests that the cult of Acraea is related to the cult of Adonis. Every year seven boys and seven girls with shorn hair and wearing black garments were dedicated to the goddess. Annual sacrifices were performed for the killed children of Medea .\nStymphalus in  Arcadia. Hera was worshipped as goddess of marriage. Three festivals  celebrated the three phases of Hera as \"pais\" (virgin), \"teleia\" (fulfilled) and \"chera\" (widowed). \"Pais\" may symbolize the arrival of the goddess in spring and \"chera\" her departure in winter. In the aetiological myth of Pausanias Hera retired after a quarell with Zeus and then she came back. During her retirement people considered that she was divorced and she was worshipped as \"chera\".\nEuboea. The island was the holy place of Hera and the goddess was worshipped  near Elymnion or on the mountain Dirfi. Coins from Eretria verify that the citizens imitated the wedding of Zeus with Hera.\nAthens. The \"sacred marriage\" of Zeus with Hera was celebrated in Athens during the month \"Gamelion\" (late winter).\nHermione in Argolis. Hera was worshipped as \"parthenos\" (virgin). In a Greek myth Zeus was transformed into a cuckoo to seduce Hera. There were two temples, one of Zeus on the mountain-Cuckoo and one of Hera on the mountain Pron.\n Olympia. In the festival Heraia young girls competed in a footrace. The race was held every four years and only virgin women were allowed to attend the games. The prize was an olive wreath. Traditionally the custom  was established by Hipodameia and choral dances were performed in honour of her. A marriage-ceremony was probably part of the festival. The choral dances and the dressing of \"parthenoi\" indicate that the festival was an initiation ritual from youth to maturity. The relation of Hera with \"parthenoi\" (virgins) seems to connect her with the goddess of vegetation.\nAegina'. Traditionally the festival was introduced from Argos. The image of Hera was carried on a chart drawn by white heifers. The festival included games and sacrifices. There was a contest between young boys for killing a female goat with their spears and they got her as a prize. In the aetiological myth Hera retired to the woods after a quarell with Zeus and her place was discovered by a female goat. Then she was obliged to return.\nNauplia in Argolis. Like the bride who took her bride-bath, Hera bathed every year in the spring Kanathos and recovered annually her virginity. This is one of the holy secrets (aporrheta) at the mysteries which they celebrated in honour of Hera.\nKnossos in Crete. The \"hieros gamos\" of Zeus with the earth goddess (finally named Hera) was celebrated near the river Theren. The ritual continued unchanged from very ancient times. The original name of the Minoan goddess could be Britomartis, Diktynna or \"Hellopis\". On a Minoan depiction the goddess seems to  arrive on a chariot during spring and she disappears in winter.\n\nEmblems\nIn Hellenistic imagery, Hera's chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, refers to it as \"the Persian bird.\" The peacock motif was revived in the Renaissance iconography that unified Hera and Juno. A bird that had been associated with Hera on an archaic level, when most of the Aegean goddesses were associated with \"their\" bird, was the cuckoo, which appears in mythic fragments concerning the first wooing of a virginal Hera by Zeus.\nHer archaic association was primarily with cattle, as a Cow Goddess, who was especially venerated in \"cattle-rich\" Euboea. On Cyprus, very early archaeological sites contain bull skulls that have been adapted for use as masks (see Bull (mythology)). Her familiar Homeric epithet Boôpis, is always translated \"cow-eyed\". In this respect, Hera bears some resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian deity Hathor, a maternal goddess associated with cattle. Hera absorbed the cult of her heifer-priestess Io and may be related to the Vedic earth-goddess Prithvi.\nScholar of Greek mythology Walter Burkert writes in Greek Religion, \"Nevertheless, there are memories of an earlier aniconic representation, as a pillar in Argos and as a plank in Samos.\" At Argos in a Greek myth the priestess of Hera  Phoronis ties her mistress to an aniconic pillar. At Samos Hera's plank was tied on a willow tree to ensure fertility.\n\nTemples of Hera\nPerachora, Corinth. One from the earliest Greek temples was the temple dedicated to  Hera Akraia at Perachora, built in the  9th century BC. The dimensions of the plan were 5,50x8,00m. A teracotta house-temple model indicates that it was an upsidal building with one room. The walls were made fom small stones and dried bricks. Τhere were two pairs of (probably wooden) columns, and the high-peaked roof was covered with straws.\nOlympia. The Heraion was built in late 7th century BC (620 BC) . It was a Doric style peripteral temple measured 18,75x50,01m at the stylobate. The number of the originally wooden  pteron columns was 6x16 (hexastyle). Τhe wooden columns were later replaced with columns from limestone. The temple had pronaos, cella, and the oldest known opisthodomos. The porches were distyle in antis. A colossal head of a woman, is probably a part of a statue dedicated to Hera. It was made from limestone.\nCorfu. The Archaic temple of Hera was built in 610BC. Large terracotta figures such as lions and gorgoneions decorated the roof of the temple. The temple was completely destroyed by fire in the 5th century BC.\nSamos. The older Heraion was built in 560 BC. It was a dipteral temple with Ionic order features. It measured 50,50x103,00 m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was 10x21. The temple formed a unit with the monumental altar of Hera to the east, which shared its alignment and axis. It was constructed partly of limestone and partly of marble. Herodotus calls Rhoecus of Samos its first architect. It was the first of the massive Ionic temples.\n\nSamos. The new Heraion was built in 525 BC and it is called the \"Polycrates temple\". The temple measured 54,58x111,50m at the stylobate. It was dipteral on the flanks and tripteral at the ends. The outer row had 8x24 columns except that at the back there were nine columns. The forms of the capitals resembled the ones at Ephesus, but the volutes were wider.\nSelinus. The Doric temple E (temble of Hera) was built in 490 BC. It measured 25.32x67.82m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was 6x15. The porches were distyle in antis\n\nPaestum. The first temple of Hera, the so-called \"Basilica\", was built in the early 6th century BC. It was an extraordinary building with a central row of inner columns. The Doric style temple measured 24,52x54,30m at the stylobate, and the number of pteron columns was 9x18. There were three columns in antis in its porch.\nPaestum. A Doric temple dedicated to Hera (the so-called temple of Poseidon) was built in the first half of the 5th century BC and is usually placed later than Parthenon. The temple measured 24,3X60,00 m at the stylobate. It was an hexastyle structure and the number of pteron columns was 6X14. The temple was also used to worship Zeus and another deity, whose identity is unknown.\n \nAgrigento. The temple of Hera (Juno Lacinia)was a Doric style peripteral building, built in 450 BC. It measured 16,90X38,15m at the stylobate and the cella measured 9.45x28,00m. The number of pteron columns was 6X13.\nArgos. The predecessor of the Heraion was built in late 7th century BC and has left little traces. The long stoa of the Heraion is dated from the late 7th to 6th century B.C.E.\nArgos. The new Heraion was built in c.410BC after the burning of  its predecessor  in 423BC. It  measured 17,40x38,00m at the stylobate and the dimensions of the cella were c.10,00x c.27,00m. The number of pteron columns cannot be specified.\n\nMythology\nBirth\nHera is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, and the sibling of Hestia, Demeter, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. Cronus was fated to be overthrown by one of his children; to prevent this, he swallowed all of his newborn children whole until Rhea tricked him into swallowing a stone instead of her youngest child, Zeus. Zeus grew up in secret and when he grew up he tricked his father into regurgitating his siblings, including Hera. Zeus then led the revolt against the Titans, banished them, and divided the dominion over the world with his brothers, Poseidon and Hades.\nOther traditions, however, appear to give Hera different upbringings. Pausanias states that she was nursed as an infant by the three daughters of the river Asterion: Euboia, Prosymna, and Akraia. Furthermore, in the Iliad, Hera states she was given by her mother to Tethys to be raised: \"I go now to the ends of the generous earth on a visit to the Ocean, whence the gods have risen, and Tethys our mother who brought me up kindly in their own house, and cared for me and took me from Rheia, at that time when Zeus of the wide brows drove Kronos underneath the earth and the barren water.\"\n\nMarriage with Zeus\nHera is the goddess of marriage and childbirth rather than motherhood, and much of her mythology revolves around her marriage with her brother Zeus. She is charmed by him and she seduces him; he cheats on her and has many children with other goddesses and mortal women; she is intensely jealous and vindictive towards his children and their mothers; he is threatening and violent to her.\nIn the Iliad, Zeus implies their marriage was some sort of elopement, as they lay secretly from their parents. Pausanias records a tale of how they came to be married in which Zeus transformed into a cuckoo to woo Hera. She caught the bird and kept it as her pet; this is why the cuckoo is seated on her sceptre. According to a scholion on Theocritus' Idylls, when Hera was heading toward Mount Thornax alone, Zeus created a terrible storm and transformed himself into a cuckoo who flew down and sat on her lap. Hera covered him with her cloak. Zeus then transformed back and took hold of her; because she was refusing to sleep with him due to their mother, he promised to marry her.\nIn one account Hera refused to marry Zeus and hid in a cave to avoid him; an earthborn man named Achilles convinced her to give him a chance, and thus the two had their first sexual intercourse. According to a version attributed to Plutarch, Hera had been reared by a nymph named Macris on the island of Euboea, but Zeus stole her away, where Mt. Cithaeron \"afforded them a shady recess.\" When Macris came to look for her ward, the mountain-god Cithaeron drove her away, saying that Zeus was taking his pleasure there with Leto.\n\nAccording to Callimachus, their wedding feast lasted three hundred years. The Apples of the Hesperides that Heracles was tasked by Eurystheus to take were a wedding gift by Gaia to the couple.\nAfter a quarrel with Zeus, Hera left him and retreated to Euboea, and no word from Zeus managed to sway her mind. Cithaeron, the local king, then advised Zeus to take a wooden statue of a woman, wrap it up, and pretend to marry it. Zeus did as told, claiming \"she\" was Plataea, Asopus's daughter. Hera, once she heard the news, disrupted the wedding ceremony and tore away the dress from the figure only to discover it was but a lifeless statue, and not a rival in love. The queen and her king were reconciled, and to commemorate this the people there celebrated a festival called Daedala. During the festival, a re-enactment of the myth was celebrated, where a wooden statue of Hera was chosen, bathed in the river Asopus and then raised on a chariot to lead the procession like a bride, and then ritually burned.\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus, Alcmene, the mother of Heracles, was the very last mortal woman Zeus ever slept with; following the birth of Heracles, he ceased to beget humans altogether.\n\nHeracles\nHera is the stepmother and enemy of Heracles. The name Heracles means \"Glory of Hera\". In Homer's Iliad, when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself, would be born and rule all those around him. Hera, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from Olympus to Argos and made the wife of Sthenelus (son of Perseus) give birth to Eurystheus after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfillment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles. In Pausanias' recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until Historis, daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.\nHera's wrath against Zeus's son continued and while Heracles was still an infant, Hera sent two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttled the snakes with his bare hands and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were a child's toys.\n\nOne account of the origin of the Milky Way is that Zeus had tricked Hera into nursing the infant Heracles: discovering who he was, she pulled him from her breast and a spurt of her milk formed the smear across the sky that can be seen to this day. Her milk also created a white flower, the lily. Unlike any Greeks, the Etruscans instead pictured a full-grown bearded Heracles at Hera's breast, a reference to his adoption by her when he became an Immortal: he had previously wounded her severely in the breast.\nWhen Heracles reached adulthood, Hera drove him mad, which led him to murder his family and this later led to him undertaking his famous labours. Hera assigned Heracles to labour for King Eurystheus at Mycenae. She attempted to make almost all of Heracles's twelve labours more difficult. When he fought the Lernaean Hydra, she sent a crab to bite at his feet in the hopes of distracting him. Later Hera stirred up the Amazons against him when he was on one of his quests. When Heracles took the cattle of Geryon, he shot Hera in the right breast with a triple-barbed arrow: the wound was incurable and left her in constant pain, as Dione tells Aphrodite in the Iliad, Book V. Afterwards, Hera sent a gadfly to bite the cattle, irritate them and scatter them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the water level of a river so much that Heracles could not ford the river with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\nEurystheus also wanted to sacrifice the Cretan Bull to Hera. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.\nSome myths state that in the end, Heracles befriended Hera by saving her from Porphyrion, a giant who tried to rape her during the Gigantomachy, and that she even gave her daughter Hebe as his bride. Whatever myth-making served to account for an archaic representation of Heracles as \"Hera's man\", it was thought suitable for the builders of the Heraion at Paestum to depict the exploits of Heracles in bas-relief.\n\nLeto and the Twins: Apollo and Artemis\nWhen Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she convinced the nature spirits to prevent Leto from giving birth on terra-firma, the mainland, any island at sea, or any place under the sun. Poseidon gave pity to Leto and guided her to the floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island where Leto was able to give birth to her children. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. The island later became sacred to Apollo. Alternatively, Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods bribed Hera with a beautiful necklace nobody could resist and she finally gave in.\nEither way, Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo. Some versions say Artemis helped her mother give birth to Apollo for nine days. Another variation states that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.\nLater, Tityos attempted to rape Leto at the behest of Hera. He was slain by Artemis and Apollo.\nThis account of the birth of Apollo and Artemis is contradicted by Hesiod in Theogony, as the twins are born prior to Zeus's marriage to Hera.\n\nIo and Argus\nThe myth of Io has many forms and embellishments. Generally, Io was a priestess of Hera at the Heraion of Argos. Zeus lusted after her and either Hera turned Io into a heifer to hide her from Zeus, or Zeus did so to hide her from Hera but was discovered. Hera had Io tethered to an olive-tree and set Argus Panoptes (lit. 'all-seeing') to watch over her, but Zeus sent Hermes to kill him. Infuriated, Hera then sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to pursue and constantly sting Io, who fled into Asia and eventually reached Egypt. There Zeus restored her to human form and she gave birth to his son Epaphus.\n\nJudgment of Paris\nA prophecy stated that a son of the sea-nymph Thetis, with whom Zeus fell in love after gazing upon her in the oceans off the Greek coast, would become greater than his father. Possibly for this reason, Thetis was betrothed to an elderly human king, Peleus son of Aeacus, either upon Zeus's orders, or because she wished to please Hera, who had raised her. All the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles) and brought many gifts. Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited and was stopped at the door by Hermes, on Zeus's order. She was annoyed at this, so she threw from the door a gift of her own: a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, \"To the fairest\"). Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.\n\nThe goddesses quarreled bitterly over it, and none of the other gods would venture an opinion favoring one, for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. They chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, they appeared before Paris to have him choose. The goddesses undressed before him, either at his request or for the sake of winning. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera offered Paris political power and control of all of Asia, while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was Helen, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen's abduction by Paris, they brought about the Trojan War.\n\nThe Iliad\nHera plays a substantial role in The Iliad, appearing in several books throughout the epic poem. She hates the Trojans because of Paris's decision that Aphrodite was the most beautiful goddess, and so supports the Greeks during the war. Throughout the epic, Hera makes many attempts to thwart the Trojan army. In books 1 and 2, Hera declares that the Trojans must be destroyed. Hera persuades Athena to aid the Achaeans in battle and she agrees to assist with interfering on their behalf.\nIn book 5, Hera and Athena plot to harm Ares, who had been seen by Diomedes in assisting the Trojans. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera, Ares's mother, saw Ares's interference and asked Zeus, Ares's father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares and he threw his spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares's body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to Mount Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.\nIn book 8, Hera tries to persuade Poseidon to disobey Zeus and help the Achaean army. He refuses, saying he doesn't want to go against Zeus. Determined to intervene in the war, Hera and Athena head to the battlefield. However, seeing the two flee, Zeus sent Iris to intercept them and make them return to Mount Olympus or face grave consequences. After prolonged fighting, Hera sees Poseidon aiding the Greeks and giving them the motivation to keep fighting.\nIn book 14 Hera devises a plan to deceive Zeus. Zeus set a decree that the gods were not allowed to interfere in the mortal war. Hera is on the side of the Achaeans, so she plans a Deception of Zeus where she seduces him, with help from Aphrodite, and tricks him into a deep sleep, with the help of Hypnos, so that the Gods could interfere without the fear of Zeus.\nIn book 21, Hera continues her interference with the battle as she tells Hephaestus to prevent the river from harming Achilles. Hephaestus sets the battlefield ablaze, causing the river to plead with Hera, promising her he will not help the Trojans if Hephaestus stops his attack. Hephaestus stops his assault and Hera returns to the battlefield where the gods begin to fight amongst themselves. After Apollo declines to battle Poseidon, Artemis eagerly engages Hera for a duel. Hera however treats the challenge as unimportant, easily disarming the haughty rival goddess and beating her with her own weapons. Artemis is left retreating back to Mount Olympus in tears to cry at Zeus's lap.\n\nMinor stories\nSemele and Dionysus\nWhen Hera learned that Semele, daughter of Cadmus King of Thebes, was pregnant by Zeus, she disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded the princess to insist that Zeus show himself to her in his true form. When he was compelled to do so, having sworn by Styx, his thunder and lightning destroyed Semele. Zeus took Semele's unborn child, Dionysus, and completed its gestation sewn into his own thigh.\nIn another version, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus by either Demeter or Persephone. Hera sent her Titans to rip the baby apart, from which he was called Zagreus (\"Torn in Pieces\"). Zeus rescued the heart; or, the heart was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate Dionysus and implant him in the womb of Semele—hence Dionysus became known as \"the twice-born\". Certain versions imply that Zeus gave Semele the heart to eat to impregnate her. Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to reveal his true form, which killed her. Dionysus later managed to rescue his mother from the underworld and have her live on Mount Olympus.\n\nLamia\nLamia was a lovely queen of Libya, whom Zeus loved; Hera in jealousy robbed Lamia of their children, either by kidnapping and hiding them away, killing them, or causing Lamia herself to kill her own offspring. Lamia became disfigured from the torment, transforming into a terrifying being who hunted and killed the children of others.\n\nGerana\nGerana was a queen of the Pygmies who boasted she was more beautiful than Hera. The wrathful goddess turned her into a crane and proclaimed that her bird descendants should wage eternal war on the Pygmy folk.\n\nCydippe\nCydippe, a priestess of Hera, was on her way to a festival in the goddess's honor. The oxen which were to pull her cart were overdue and her sons, Biton and Cleobis, pulled the cart the entire way (45 stadia, 8 kilometers). Cydippe was impressed with their devotion to her and Hera, and so asked Hera to give her children the best gift a god could give a person. Hera ordained that the brothers would die in their sleep.\nThis honor bestowed upon the children was later used by Solon as proof when trying to convince Croesus that it is impossible to judge a person's happiness until they have died a fruitful death after a joyous life.\n\nTiresias\nTiresias was a priest of Zeus, and as a young man, he encountered two snakes mating and hit them with a stick. He was then transformed into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married, and had children, including Manto. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to Hyginus, trampled on them and became a man once more.\nAs a result of his experiences, Zeus and Hera asked him to settle the question of which sex, male or female, experienced more pleasure during intercourse. Zeus claimed it was women; Hera claimed it was men. When Tiresias sided with Zeus, Hera struck him blind. Since Zeus could not undo what she had done, he gave him the gift of prophecy.\nAn alternative and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, begged her to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him a prophecy instead.\n\nChelone\nAt the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a nymph named Chelone was disrespectful or refused to attend the wedding. Zeus thus turned her into a tortoise.\n\nThe Golden Fleece\nHera hated Pelias because he had killed Sidero, his step-grandmother, in one of the goddess's temples. She later convinced Jason and Medea to kill Pelias. The Golden Fleece was the item that Jason needed to get his mother freed.\n\nIxion\nWhen Zeus had pity on Ixion and brought him to Olympus and introduced him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, who was later named Nephele, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it. From their union came Centaurus. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity, first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to Tartarus.\n\nChildren\nGenealogy\nArt and events\nBarberini Hera - a Roman sculpture of Hera/Juno\nHera Borghese - a sculpture related to Hera\nHera Farnese - a sculpture of Hera's head\nHeraea Games - games dedicated to Hera—the first sanctioned (and recorded) women's athletic competition to be held in the stadium at Olympia.\n\nSee also\nAncient Greece portal\n Myths portal\n Religion portal\n\nAuðumbla, a primeval cow in Norse mythology\nParvati\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nReferences\nApollodorus, Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.

He is known for his humorous commentary during gameplay, and often plays games in unorthodox or mischievous ways. He began making videos in 2011, began streaming in 2016, and experienced a surge in popularity in 2018. As of 15 August 2023, his YouTube channel has over 2.8 million subscribers, while his Twitch channel has over 1.1 million followers.\n\nEarly life\nCondren was born in Ireland on 13 April 1995, the son of an Irish father and Canadian mother. He holds dual Irish and Canadian citizenship. He studied at Trinity College in Dublin, where he earned a bachelor's degree in English literature in November 2017. It was during his time in college when he gained the title of 'The Drift King' after winning a college Mario Kart tournament on 3 December 2015.\n\nCareer\nCondren created his YouTube channel on 13 August 2011 and uploaded his first video, a Terraria Let's Play, five days later. In December 2018, he joined Yogscast's annual charity event Jingle Jam, where he helped raise $3.3 million.\nHis videos have included organising Minecraft building sessions for his Twitch subscribers, spending 13 days (and an in-game time of 2 days) searching for a shiny Wooloo in Pokémon Sword and Shield, and knocking out every NPC in the Hitman 3 level of Sapienza in order to stuff them all into a meat freezer and kill the entire population with a single shot into an explosive canister (which ultimately failed when the bodies formed a \"meat shield\").\nIn December 2022, YouTube age-restricted some of his videos. Condren asserted that the platform was \"retroactively restricting videos that violate recent policy changes.\" The updated guidelines gained visibility when he made a video on the topic, with YouTube set to revise the policy after being criticised for its poor communication regarding these changes.\n\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yuzu (Citrus × junos, from Japanese 柚子 or ユズ;  ) is a citrus fruit and plant in the family Rutaceae of Chinese origin. Yuzu has been cultivated mainly in East Asia, though it has also recently been grown in New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Italy, and France.\nIt is believed to have originated in central China as an F1 hybrid of the mangshanyeju (Chinese: 莽山野橘) subspecies of mandarin orange and the ichang papeda.\n\nDescription\nThis fruit resembles a yellow clementine with uneven skin and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. Yuzu fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between 5.5 and 7.5 cm (2+1⁄8 and 3 in) in diameter but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to 10 cm or 4 in, or larger).\nYuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns. Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like petiole, resembling those of the related makrut lime and ichang papeda, and are heavily scented.\nYuzu closely resembles sudachi (Citrus sudachi, a Japanese citrus from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu–mandarin orange cross) in many regards, though, unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit.\n\nCultivation\nThe yuzu originated and grew wild in Tibet and central China. It was introduced to Japan and Korea during the Tang dynasty and is still cultivated there. It grows slowly, generally requiring ten years to fruit. To shorten the duration to fruiting, it may be grafted onto karatachi (P. trifoliata). It is unusual among citrus plants in being relatively frost-hardy, due to its cold-hardy Ichang papeda ancestry, and can be grown in regions with winters as low as −7 °C (19 °F) where more sensitive citrus would not thrive.\n\nVarieties and similar fruits\nIn Japan, an ornamental version of yuzu called hana yuzu (花柚子, 花ゆず) \"flower yuzu\" is also grown for its flowers rather than its fruit. A sweet variety of yuzu known as the yuko, only present in Japan, became severely endangered during the 1970s and 1980s; a major attempt has been made to revive this varietal in southern Japan. Another variety of yuzu in Japan, with knobby skin, is called shishi yuzu (獅子柚子, literally \"lion yuzu\").\nDangyuja, a Korean citrus fruit from Jeju Island, is often considered a type of yuzu due to its similar shape and flavor, but it is genetically a variety of pomelo.\n\nUse\nEast Asia\nCulinary use\nJapan\nYuzu's domestic production is about 27,000 tons (2016). Though rarely eaten as a fruit, yuzu is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, where the aromatic zest (outer rind) and the juice are used much in the same way that lemons are used in other cuisines. The yuzu's flavor is tart and fragrant, closely resembling that of the grapefruit, with overtones of mandarin orange.\nIt is an integral ingredient (along with sudachi, daidai, and other similar citrus fruits) in the citrus-based sauce ponzu, and yuzu vinegar is also produced. Yuzu is often combined with honey to make yuzu hachimitsu (柚子蜂蜜), a kind of syrup that is used to make yuzu tea (柚子茶), or as an ingredient in alcoholic drinks such as the yuzu sour (柚子サワー). Yuzu kosho (also yuzukosho, literally 'yuzu and pepper') is a spicy Japanese sauce made from green or yellow yuzu zest, green or red chili peppers, and salt.\nIt is used to make liquor (such as yuzukomachi, 柚子小町) and wine. Slivered yuzu rind is used to garnish a savory, salty egg-pudding dish called chawanmushi, as well as miso soup. It is often used along with sudachi and kabosu. Yuzu is used to make various sweets, including marmalade and cake. It is used extensively in the flavoring of many snack products, such as Doritos.\n\nKorea\nIn Korean cuisine, yuja is most commonly used to make yuja-cheong (유자청, yuja marmalade) and yuja tea. Yuja-cheong can be made by sugaring peeled, depulped, and thinly sliced yuja, and yuja-cha, yuja tea, can be made by mixing hot water with yuja-cheong. Yuja-hwachae (유자화채, yuja punch), a variety of hwachae (fruit punch), is another common dessert made with yuja. Yuja is also a common ingredient in Korean-style Western food, such as salads.\n\nOther uses\nYuzu baths\nYuzu is also known for its characteristically strong aroma, and the oil from its skin is marketed as a fragrance. In Japan, bathing with yuzu on Tōji, the winter solstice, is a custom that dates to at least the early 18th century. Whole yuzu fruits are floated in the hot water of the bath, sometimes enclosed in a cloth bag, releasing their aroma. The fruit may also be cut in half, allowing the citrus juice to mingle with the bathwater. The yuzu bath, known commonly as yuzu yu (柚子湯), but also as yuzu buro (柚子風呂), is said to guard against colds, treat the roughness of skin, warm the body, and relax the mind.\n\nUse as wood\nThe body of the taepyeongso, a Korean traditional oboe, close to the Chinese suona or the zurna, is often made from jujube, mulberry, or yuzu wood.\n\nElsewhere\nAs of the early 21st century, yuzu has been increasingly used by chefs in the United States and other Western nations, achieving notice in a 2003 article in The New York Times.\nIn the United States, the Department of Agriculture has a ban on the import of fresh yuzu (alongside most citrus plants) from abroad, including both the fruit and the trees. This is intended to prevent the spread of contagious diseases amongst domestic crops. However, as a result of its introduction to California in 1888, yuzu is cultivated and available for sale in the United States.\n\nSee also\nCalamansi\nDangyuja\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to yuzu at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to yuzu at Wikispecies\n The dictionary definition of yuzu at Wiktionary",

Currently he is a streamer for Team Liquid.\n\nCareer\nSamson \"Lourlo\" Jackson started gaming with World of Warcraft and has since played Hearthstone, Diablo, Bloodline Champions, and League of Legends. In 2012, he played on Severity Gaming, but it wasn't until 2014 that he joined his first serious team.\n\n2015 Preseason\nLourlo joined Storm in September 2014 as one of the team's founding members, along with hairyabs, mandatorycloud, xPecake, and babyeator. The team was initially going to attempt to qualify for the 2015 spring LCS via the Expansion Tournament. However, because Lourlo would not turn 17 until March 24, 2015, the team decided to keep Lourlo on the roster and play in the Challenger scene for one split instead.\n\n2015 season\nLourlo left Storm and later joined CLG Black after Westrice left, beginning to play for them in the second week of the NACS Spring Season. The team placed 6th and last in the season, after losing a tiebreaker game to TSM Darkness. CLG Black retained their summer season qualifier seed from having participated in the spring season, receiving a first-round bye. However, after defeating Maelstrom, they lost to Cloud9 Tempest and then to Magnetic, missing out on the NACS summer season.\n\n2016 season\nIn January, Team Liquid announced Lourlo as their top laner for the 2016 NA LCS Spring Season, filling the gap left by Quas's suspension. Liquid's spring split started out rocky, with an 0-2 first week and cumulative wins of 50% or worse after each of the first eight weeks. Eventually, their new roster started to solidify, and they climbed into a fourth-place regular-season finish, behind the newly formed and almost-undefeated Immortals, CLG, and Cloud9. Their quarterfinal series was an easy 3–0 over NRG, but in the semifinals, they lost a narrow five-game series to CLG (the eventual champions). In the fifth game, Piglet was caught out in mid-lane by a double-teleport from both Darshan and Huhi at the same time to the same ward and died. While Liquid was already behind in that game, it was this play that sealed the win for their opponents. In the third-place series against the tournament-favorite Immortals who had been knocked down in an upset by TSM, Liquid lost once again, this time 0–3, to finish the playoffs in fourth place overall and continuing their \"fourth-place curse.\"\nAs Team Liquid's season seemed to be on an upswing, as they had taken MSI finalists CLG to 5 games, they boot camped in Korea in order to increase the skill of their players. During this time, Lourlo's rocky rookie split was brought into question and Team Liquid Academy top laner 'Zig' was brought to Korea to fight for his spot. Lourlo won his spot back but jungler 'Dardoch' was suspended from the team for poor behavior. Team Liquid started their season with Moon in the jungle but failed to live up to their expectation and Dardoch was brought back in. A rocky start and rising tension between coach 'Locodoco', World-Champion 'Piglet', and Dardoch caused Piglet to voluntarily leave for their Academy team, and ADC 'Fabby' was brought to their main team. With Piglet gone, Lourlo was able to establish himself with some of the best in the League as a carry top-laner and his powerful synergy with Dardoch caused them to look to claim a World's spot at the end of the season. After a rough last 2 weeks, Team Liquid finished fifth after losing a 10k gold lead against CLG which further heightened the tensions between Dardoch and Locodoco. Team Liquid was to face CLG in the first round of playoffs, when they were down 0–2, Fabby's poor performance finally caused him to be benched for unknown player 'Jynthe'. Team Liquid was only able to win one game back before losing the set. In the Regional qualifier, Dardoch was subbed out for mid-laner 'Arcsecond'. Despite having good early games against Team nV, Team Liquid lost the set 3-0 and caused them to fall short of World's again.\n\n2020 season\nLourlo signed with Dignitas Academy during the 2020 offseason. They finished second in the Academy regular season but placed 3rd/4th in the playoffs after losing to  Evil Geniuses Academy in the semifinals. Lourlo continued to play for Dignitas Academy for the summer but was called up to the main LCS roster after at the start of week three and played there until the end of week six. He played with Dignitas Academy for the rest of the year.\n\n2021 season\nLourlo continued to play with Dignitas Academy for the entirety of the 2021 competitive season. He parted ways with Dignitas at the end of the year.\n\nReferences\n\nAs of this edit, this article uses content from \"Lourlo\", which is licensed in a way that permits reuse under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, but not under the GFDL.

        "content": "Maximilian Bradley Fewtrell (born 29 July 1999) is a British former racing driver and current content creator. He was the 2016 British F4 champion. Fewtrell has since retired from professional racing.\nFewtrell was born in Birmingham. At a young age, he moved to Malaysia first, then Singapore for 9 years. He also has an older brother, Sam, a younger brother, Theo, and an older sister Francesca.\n\nRacing career\nKarting\nMax began karting in 2009 at the age of ten after watching the Singapore Grand Prix. Fewtrell karted in Singapore but competed mainly in Malaysia. He went on to take major karting titles in 2013 and 2014.\n\nLower Formula\nIn 2015, Fewtrell graduated to single-seaters, partaking in the MRF Challenge where he finished eleventh. The following year, Fewtrell joined Carlin for a campaign in British F4. He took three victories and claimed the championship in the final race at Brands Hatch.\n\nFormula Renault\nIn December 2016, Fewtrell was named as part of Tech 1 Racing's driver line-up for the 2017 seasons of Formula Renault 2.0. Around the same time, Fewtrell was named as part of the Renault Sport Academy's 2017 line-up. He won a race at the Red Bull Ring on his way to the rookies' title, and came sixth in the drivers' championship.\nThe following year, Fewtrell switched to reigning team champions R-ace GP. He achieved six poles and six wins, including a double victory across a two race weekend at Hockenheim, making him the first driver to do so since Nyck de Vries. Fewtrell claimed the championship title in the season finale after a season-long battle with fellow Renault junior Christian Lundgaard.\n\nGP3 Series\nAfter winning the 2018 Formula Renault Eurocup, Fewtrell partook in the post-season test with ART Grand Prix.\n\nFIA Formula 3 Championship\nIn January 2019, Fewtrell joined the championship with ART Grand Prix, alongside Christian Lundgaard and David Beckmann. He finished on the podium twice, first in Austria and then again at the Hungaroring, both being second-place finishes. Fewtrell concluded his debut season in 10th place, after scoring 57 points.\nFewtrell subsequently joined Hitech GP for the 2020 season. He left the team in August 2020.\n\nOther ventures\nFewtrell has gained over 150,000 followers on the streaming platform Twitch, where he plays FPS games such as Escape from Tarkov and Call of Duty or races in iRacing on a simulator alongside fellow streamers and occasionally with his close friend Lando Norris, who currently races in Formula One. He took part in Norris' Twitch Rivals Charity Tournament in 2021. After appearing in some earlier content, on 13 June 2021, Fewtrell was announced as a new ambassador and core member of Norris' entertainment, athlete and apparel brand, Team Quadrant.

He was a former CS:GO professional player before announcing that he would be officially making the switch to Riot Games' Valorant. He would find most of his success in Valorant as he went on to win their first international LAN tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland.\n\nEarly life and career history\nKhan grew up in Maryland. On December 15, 2014, he joined Cloud9.\nKhan was central in uncovering the iBuyPower and NetcodeGuides match fixing scandal, after he issued a statement confirming that the match at issue had been thrown.\nOn April 13, 2016, he was released from OpTic Gaming.\nOn May 19, 2016 Echo Fox replaced AWPer Mohamad \"m0E\" Assad (who was promoted to general manager), picking up ShahZaM as his replacement.\nOn December 15, 2016, ShahZaM and Sgares joined Team SoloMid.\nOn January 17, 2017, ShahZaM and the rest of the Team SoloMid roster were acquired by Misfits Gaming.\nOn February 7, 2018, ShahZaM joined OpTic Gaming.\nOn April 27, 2018, ShahZaM joined compLexity Gaming as an AWPer.\nOn October 28, 2019, ShahZaM was removed from the active roster of compLexity Gaming. The announcement was made in the wake of Complexity's poor performance during the months prior, including their early elimination from the StarSeries Berlin Major. ShahZaM later communicated on his Twitch stream that the team had struggled in large part due to the relative inexperience of many of the team's members, which included the then 16 year old Owen \"oBo\" Schlatter. ShahZaM expressed frustration with not being able to focus on his primary role of AWPing due to constantly having to perform in-game duties that on a more experienced roster would have been able to take on.\nOn November 26, 2019, ShahZaM announced his free-agency via Twitter, bringing an official end to his time with CompLexity Gaming. ShahZaM also mentioned his eagerness to find a new team as quickly as possible.\nOn April 28, 2020, ShahZaM signed with Sentinels, officially making the switch over to Valorant.\nOn October 6, 2022, ShahZaM was informed live on his Twitch stream that he would not be offered a renewed contract with Sentinels when his current contract expires at the end of the year.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty",
        "content": "A patty is a flattened, usually round, serving of ground meat or legumes, grains, vegetables, or meat alternatives. Common ground meat used include beef, bison, elk, turkey, chicken, ostrich, and salmon. Patties are found in multiple cuisines throughout the world.\nThe ingredients are compacted and shaped, usually cooked, and served in various ways.\n\nEtymology\nThe term originated in the 17th century as an English alteration of the French word pâté, originally meaning a pastry with a meat filling, and later the filling itself.\n\nTerminology\nThe term \"patty\" is used in many varieties of English, but less frequently in Britain and Ireland than in the United States. Merriam-Webster defines it as \"a small flat cake of chopped food\", Cambridge as \"pieces of food, especially meat, formed into a thin, circular shape and then usually cooked\". In some countries, patties may be called \"discs.\"\nSimilar-shaped cakes not made from ground beef may also be called \"burgers\": \"fish burgers\" may be made from reshaped mechanically separated meat. Patties made from chicken meat may be called chicken patties.\nVeggie burger patties are made without meat and instead use legumes, grains, other mixed vegetables, and/or soy products such as tofu or tempeh or seitan, a product made of wheat gluten, often mixed with a binding agent.\n\nVariations and serving styles\nCroquettes\nPatties can be breaded and deep-fried, producing croquettes such as crab cakes. In Ireland, traditional chippers often serve batter burgers (a beef-based patty dipped in batter and deep fried). A batter burger served as a sandwich is called a wurly burger, and is believed to have been invented by the Mona Lisa chipper in Crumlin, Dublin. In Japan the Korokke is an example. Rissoles are meat (typically beef), or fish and other ingredients, coated in breadcrumbs or less frequently battered, and deep-fried; they are found in various European cuisines.\n\nCutlets\nPatties can be treated as a cutlet and eaten with a knife and fork in dishes like Salisbury steak, the German Hamburg steak, or the Serbo-Croatian pljeskavica, or with chopsticks in dishes such as Songjeong tteok-galbi. Other examples include the Russian Pozharsky cutlet.\n\nFritters\nAloo tikki is a potato patty that originated in the Indian subcontinent. A related dish is ragda pattice, which covers the potato patty in a gravy.\nAn arepa is a dish of maize and other ingredients shaped into a patty and griddled; it has been eaten in parts of Central and South American since pre-Columbian times.\n\nQuenelles\nGefilte fish is often served as a quenelle, a patty shaped into a flattened egg.\n\nSandwich fillings\nPatties are often served as sandwiches, typically in buns, making a type of sandwich called a \"burger\", or a hamburger if the patty is made from ground beef, or sometimes between slices of bread. An American patty melt is a ground beef patty topped with melted cheese (typically Swiss) served on toasted bread, typically rye.\nIn Ireland, traditional chippers often serve sandwiches called spice burgers.\nIn Japan and Korea, a ground beef patty is sometimes served as a sandwich on a \"bun\" made of compressed rice; the sandwich is called a rice burger.\n\nTartares\nSome patties, like steak tartare and Middle Eastern kibbeh nayeh, are served raw.\n\nCommercial production\nCommercially produced patties are machine-formed.\nWith mass-produced patties, it is not uncommon to find them with seemingly abnormal shapes or a bumpy perimeter. These groove-like bumps are caused by the machine that forms the patties. They are used in production to keep the patties in line, so they will not fall off the assembly line, and can be manipulated by the various machines. In other boxed patties, small punctures can be seen in the top and bottom sides of the patty. These punctures are there for similar reasons.\n\nSee also\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel Francesca (born December 27, 1993), better known as dafran, is a Danish Twitch video game streamer and former professional Overwatch player. As an esports competitor, Francesca represented Selfless Gaming before being suspended from competitive play. He returned to competitive play with Atlanta Reign, one of the expansion franchises for the 2019 Overwatch League season. At the end of the Stage 1 of the League's 2019 season, Francesca announced that he would be stepping away from competitive play in favor of being a full-time streamer for the Atlanta Reign. Francesca has also played in the Overwatch World Cup for Team Denmark in 2016.\n\nCareer\nSelfless Gaming\nOn January 31, 2017, esports organization Selfless Gaming announced the addition of Francesca to their Overwatch roster. The team qualified for Season Zero of Overwatch Contenders 2017 on June 3; however, two days later, Francesca was suspended from casual and competitive play by Blizzard and Selfless Gaming after throwing Overwatch games on stream while streaming a pornographic dating sim game, Nekopara, atop his matches. \"While Dafran will no longer be playing with our team,\" Selfless said in a statement, \"we will be assisting him in finding the help, counseling, and guidance that he needs to improve his mental and emotional well-being.\" While Francesca was still on the team's roster, Selfless disbanded on July 7, 2017.\n\nAtlanta Reign\n\nFrancesca was approved to join Atlanta's professional Overwatch League team (later revealed as Atlanta Reign) in September 2018; although he refuted the claim. A month later, Reign announced their inaugural season starting roster, which included dafran. On November 7, Francesca announced via Twitter that he would be leaving the Overwatch League, stating, \"The end. I hate the game. Thought I could love it again and have passion, but it's impossible. I always end up soft throwing. Contract ended. Overwatch uninstalled. McDonald's here I come. For real though, thanks for everything you have given me OW community.\" However, he apologized and rejoined the team a day later, stating that he made a \"dumb\" mistake. The retraction marked the fourth time in nearly four months that he had changed his intentions about participating in the Overwatch League.\nThroughout Stage 1 of the 2019 season, Francesca had the top-selling Overwatch League jersey, ahead of the 2018 season MVP Bang \"JJonak\" Sung-hyeon. Francesca helped Atlanta Reign finish Stage 1 with a 4–3 record and a Stage 1 playoff berth. Reign lost in the quarterfinals to Philadelphia Fusion on March 22; five days later, Francesca announced that he was, again, officially retiring from the Overwatch League and becoming an official Atlanta Reign streamer, citing that professional gaming was not something he enjoyed anymore.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is a member of OfflineTV, an online group of content creators, and was one of the most subscribed female Twitch streamers in the late 2010s and early 2020s. She remains one of the most followed female streamers on the platform. As a voice actress, she is most well-known for the voice of Genshin Impact character Sayu and the English dub voice of Muni Ohnaruto in D4DJ First Mix. Ki began creating videos on YouTube in June 2010 and streaming on Twitch in August 2012. After ten years of streaming on Twitch, she signed an exclusive contract with YouTube in July 2022 and announced the move to the platform. However, as of July 12, 2024, Ki returned to streaming on Twitch after her contract deal with YouTube expired.\n\nEarly life and education\nKi was born on November 20, 1991, in Queens, New York. Her family lived in The Bronx before moving to North Jersey. She is of Korean descent, and has a brother named Daniel. Ki grew up in a musical household and began playing the piano at a young age, but she also had an interest in art and illustration. She received an associate's degree in Arts and Music at a community college.\n\nCareer\nKi's content includes gaming, art, and music. She first gained popularity in 2011 when her parody song \"I'll Quit LoL\" went viral on YouTube.  In 2015, she made her musical debut with the release of her extended play Lilies. In July 2017, a video of Ki playing the melodica to unsuspecting cosplayers at PopCon Indy also went viral, becoming her most viewed YouTube video to date. That same month, she joined OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group of content creators. In September 2018, Riot Games launched a series of ads on YouTube for League of Legends which featured Ki and other content creators.\nKi was the fifth most-watched female Twitch streamer in 2020. In 2020, she was nominated for the Shorty Award for Twitch Streamer of the Year. That same year, she appeared in an advertisement for 5 Gum. In 2021, Ki appeared in the music video for Bella Poarch and Sub Urban's song \"Inferno\", where she cameoed alongside several other content creators. At the 1st Streamer Awards in 2022, Ki was nominated for Best League of Legends Streamer and Best Music Streamer, winning for the latter.\nIn July 2022, it was announced that Ki had signed exclusively with YouTube and will no longer stream on Twitch.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2018, Ki began dating YouTuber Albert Chang, better known as Sleightlymusical, and in 2019, they separated after he had an affair. On February 21, 2020, Ki confirmed on a livestream that she and fellow OfflineTV member Michael Reeves were in a relationship.\nOn June 27, 2020, Ki and Yvonne \"Yvonnie\" Ng came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against former OfflineTV member Federico \"Fedmyster\" Gaytan, stating that he would enter her room uninvited and make inappropriate advances on her. Gaytan was removed from the group following the allegations, and in the week following his removal, six members of OfflineTV came forward with stories of his inappropriate and manipulative behavior.\n\nDiscography\nExtended plays\nSingles\nAs a lead artist\nAs a featured artist\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nVideo games\nMusic videos\nAwards and nominations\n\n\n== References ==",

He is known for his Minecraft hardcore series, where he plays the game on its most difficult setting, with permadeath (one life per game) and no respawns. Watson also formerly held the world record for the longest-running Minecraft hardcore world. As of May 2024, he had 4.3 million followers on Twitch.\n\nEarly life\nPhillip Watson was born on 1 March 1988. He is from Newcastle upon Tyne, England.\nHe worked in a retail job for more than a decade while making content on Twitch and YouTube before quitting his job to become a full-time content creator.\n\nCareer\n2006–2013: Early career\nWatson created his YouTube account in 2006 and started his channel by uploading Halo 2 and Skate 2 content. He created his Twitch (then Justin.tv) account \"Philza\" in 2009.\n\n2014–2019: Minecraft hardcore series and initial growth\nIn 2014, Watson started his Minecraft hardcore series, playing the game in its most difficult setting with increased mobs difficulty, permadeath (one life per game), and no respawns. The series garnered significant attention in April 2019 when Watson's then-world-record five-year hardcore run ended due to a surprise attack by a fully enchanted golden-armoured baby zombie, a spider, and a skeleton. Watson has described this event as a turning point in his career, propelling him from an average viewership of 5–15 per stream to roughly 180 viewers on Twitch. The success of the series ultimately led him to leave his retail job and pursue content creation full-time.\nOn 26 July 2019, Watson was featured in the official Minecraft series Meet a Minecrafter.\n\n2020–present: Continued growth\nIn October 2021, Watson appeared in the Twitch leaks, which disclosed the top Twitch streamers' revenue from August 2019 to October 2021. Watson placed 47th on the list, with a reported payout of $1,364,215.61 for this time period.\nIn 2023, Watson, along with fellow Twitch streamers and YouTubers TommyInnit, Wilbur Soot, Slimecicle, and Ranboo, started a new comedy group YouTube channel called The Sorry Boys. The channel mainly posted sketch comedy group vlog content. The group went on an indefinite hiatus in March 2024.\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn September 2021, Watson participated in a charity livestream fundraising event organized by fellow streamer and YouTuber Technoblade. The event featured a Minecraft game where Watson served as one of the \"hunters\" tasked with pursuing Technoblade. They managed to raise more than $324,000 for the Sarcoma Foundation of America.\n\nPersonal life\nWatson met his wife, Kristin Rosales, an American, on Twitch and began dating. They were married on 12 March 2020, at the Old Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana, California.\n\nFilmography\nWeb\nReferences\nExternal links\nPhilza's channel on YouTube\nPhilza on Twitch",

        "streamer": "KNIGHT",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight",
        "content": "A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state (including the pope) or representative for service to the monarch, the church or the country, especially in a military capacity. \nThe concept of knighthood may have been inspired by the ancient Greek hippeis (ἱππεῖς) and Roman equites. In the Early Middle Ages in Western Christian Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of petty nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter or a bodyguard for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry, cavalier and related terms such as the French title chevalier. In that sense, the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the furusiyya in the Islamic world. The Crusades brought various military orders of knights to the forefront of defending Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.\nIn the Late Middle Ages, new methods of warfare – such as the introduction of the culverin as an anti-personnel, gunpowder-fired weapon – began to render classical knights in armour obsolete, but the titles remained in many countries. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459–1519) is often referred to as the \"last knight\" in this regard; however, some of the most iconic battles of the Knights Hospitaller, such as the Siege of Rhodes and the Great Siege of Malta, took place after his rule. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, and the Matter of Britain, relating to the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.\nToday, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in Christian Churches, as well as in several historically Christian countries and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Protestant Order of Saint John, as well as the English Order of the Garter, the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim, the Spanish Order of Santiago, and the Norwegian Order of St. Olav. There are also dynastic orders like the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Imperial Order of the Rose, the Order of the British Empire and the Order of St. George. In modern times these are orders centered around charity and civic service, and are no longer military orders. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a head of state, monarch, or prelate to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the British honours system, often for service to the Church or country. The modern female equivalent in the English language is Dame. Knighthoods and damehoods are traditionally regarded as being one of the most prestigious awards people can obtain.\n\nEtymology\nThe word knight, from Old English cniht (\"boy\" or \"servant\"), is a cognate of the German word Knecht (\"servant, bondsman, vassal\"). This meaning, of unknown origin, is common among West Germanic languages (cf Old Frisian kniucht, Dutch knecht, Danish knægt, Swedish knekt, Norwegian knekt, Middle High German kneht, all meaning \"boy, youth, lad\"). Middle High German had the phrase guoter kneht, which also meant knight; but this meaning was in decline by about 1200.\nThe meaning of cniht changed over time from its original meaning of \"boy\" to \"household retainer\". Ælfric's homily of St. Swithun describes a mounted retainer as a cniht. While cnihtas might have fought alongside their lords, their role as household servants features more prominently in the Anglo-Saxon texts. In several Anglo-Saxon wills cnihtas are left either money or lands. In his will, King Æthelstan leaves his cniht, Aelfmar, eight hides of land.\nA rādcniht, \"riding-servant\", was a servant on horseback.\nA narrowing of the generic meaning \"servant\" to \"military follower of a king or other superior\" is visible by 1100. The specific military sense of a knight as a mounted warrior in the heavy cavalry emerges only in the Hundred Years' War. The verb \"to knight\" (to make someone a knight) appears around 1300; and, from the same time, the word \"knighthood\" shifted from \"adolescence\" to \"rank or dignity of a knight\".\nAn Equestrian (Latin, from eques \"horseman\", from equus \"horse\") was a member of the second highest social class in the Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. This class is often translated as \"knight\"; the medieval knight, however, was called miles in Latin (which in classical Latin meant \"soldier\", normally infantry).\nIn the later Roman Empire, the classical Latin word for horse, equus, was replaced in common parlance by the vulgar Latin caballus, sometimes thought to derive from Gaulish caballos. From caballus arose terms in the various Romance languages cognate with the (French-derived) English cavalier: Italian cavaliere, Spanish caballero, French chevalier (whence chivalry), Portuguese cavaleiro, and Romanian cavaler.  The Germanic languages have terms cognate with the English rider: German Ritter, and Dutch and Scandinavian ridder. These words are derived from Germanic rīdan, \"to ride\", in turn derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *reidh-.\n\nHistory and evolution of medieval knighthood\nPre-Carolingian legacies\nIn ancient Rome, there was a knightly class Ordo Equestris (order of mounted nobles). Some portions of the armies of Germanic peoples who occupied Europe from the 3rd century AD onward had been mounted, and some armies, such as those of the Ostrogoths, were mainly cavalry. However, it was the Franks who generally fielded armies composed of large masses of infantry, with an infantry elite, the comitatus, which often rode to battle on horseback rather than marching on foot. When the armies of the Frankish ruler Charles Martel defeated the Umayyad Arab invasion at the Battle of Tours in 732, the Frankish forces were still largely infantry armies, with elites riding to battle but dismounting to fight.\n\nCarolingian age\nIn the Early Medieval period, any well-equipped horseman could be described as a knight, or miles in Latin. The first knights appeared during the reign of Charlemagne in the 8th century. As the Carolingian Age progressed, the Franks were generally on the attack, and larger numbers of warriors took to their horses to ride with the Emperor in his wide-ranging campaigns of conquest. At about this time the Franks increasingly remained on horseback to fight on the battlefield as true cavalry rather than mounted infantry, with the discovery of the stirrup, and would continue to do so for centuries afterwards. Although in some nations the knight returned to foot combat in the 14th century, the association of the knight with mounted combat with a spear, and later a lance, remained a strong one. The older Carolingian ceremony of presenting a young man with weapons influenced the emergence of knighthood ceremonies, in which a noble would be ritually given weapons and declared to be a knight, usually amid some festivities.  These mobile mounted warriors made Charlemagne's far-flung conquests possible, and to secure their service he rewarded them with grants of land called benefices. These were given to the captains directly by the Emperor to reward their efforts in the conquests, and they in turn were to grant benefices to their warrior contingents, who were a mix of free and unfree men. In the century or so following Charlemagne's death, his newly empowered warrior class grew stronger still, and Charles the Bald declared their fiefs to be hereditary, and also issued the Edict of Pîtres in 864, largely moving away from the infantry-based traditional armies and calling upon all men who could afford it to answer calls to arms on horseback to quickly repel the constant and wide-ranging Viking attacks, which is considered the beginnings of the period of knights that were to become so famous and spread throughout Europe in the following centuries. The period of chaos in the 9th and 10th centuries, between the fall of the Carolingian central authority and the rise of separate Western and Eastern Frankish kingdoms (later to become France and Germany respectively) only entrenched this newly landed warrior class. This was because governing power and defense against Viking, Magyar and Saracen attack became an essentially local affair which revolved around these new hereditary local lords and their demesnes.\n\nMultiple crusades and military orders\nClerics and the Church often opposed the practices of the Knights because of their abuses against women and civilians, and many such as St. Bernard de Clairvaux were convinced that Knights served the devil and not God, and needed reforming. \nIn the course of the 12th century, knighthood became a social rank with a distinction being made between milites gregarii (non-noble cavalrymen) and milites nobiles (true knights). As the term \"knight\" became increasingly confined to denoting a social rank, the military role of fully armoured cavalryman gained a separate term, \"man-at-arms\". Although any medieval knight going to war would automatically serve as a man-at-arms, not all men-at-arms were knights. \nThe first military orders of knighthood were the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and the Knights Hospitaller, both founded shortly after the First Crusade of 1099, followed by the Order of Saint Lazarus (1100), Knights Templars (1118), the Order of Montesa (1128), the Order of Santiago (1170) and the Teutonic Knights (1190). At the time of their foundation, these were intended as monastic orders, whose members would act as simple soldiers protecting pilgrims. \nIt was only over the following century, with the successful conquest of the Holy Land and the rise of the crusader states, that these orders became powerful and prestigious.\nThe great European legends of warriors such as the paladins, the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain popularized the notion of chivalry among the warrior class. The ideal of chivalry as the ethos of the Christian warrior, and the transmutation of the term \"knight\" from the meaning \"servant, soldier\", and of chevalier \"mounted soldier\", to refer to a member of this ideal class, is significantly influenced by the Crusades, on one hand inspired by the military orders of monastic warriors, and on the other hand also cross-influenced by Islamic (Saracen) ideals of furusiyya.\n\nKnightly culture in the Middle Ages\nTraining\nThe institution of knights was already well-established by the 10th century. While the knight was essentially a title denoting a military office, the term could also be used for positions of higher nobility such as landholders. The higher nobles grant the vassals their portions of land (fiefs) in return for their loyalty, protection, and service. The nobles also provided their knights with necessities, such as lodging, food, armour, weapons, horses, and money. The knight generally held his lands by military tenure which was measured through military service that usually lasted 40 days a year. The military service was the quid pro quo for each knight's fief. Vassals and lords could maintain any number of knights, although knights with more military experience were those most sought after. Thus, all petty nobles intending to become prosperous knights needed a great deal of military experience. A knight fighting under another's banner was called a knight bachelor while a knight fighting under his own banner was a knight banneret.\nSome knights were familiar with city culture or familiarized with it during training. These knights, among others, were called in to end large insurgencies and other large uprisings that involved urban areas such as the Peasants' Revolt of England and the 1323–1328 Flemish revolt.\n\nPage\nA knight had to be born of nobility – typically sons of knights or lords. In some cases, commoners could also be knighted as a reward for extraordinary military service. Children of the nobility were cared for by noble foster-mothers in castles until they reached the age of seven.\nThese seven-year-old boys were given the title of page and turned over to the care of the castle's lords. They were placed on an early training regime of hunting with huntsmen and falconers, and academic studies with priests or chaplains. Pages then become assistants to older knights in battle, carrying and cleaning armour, taking care of the horses, and packing the baggage. They would accompany the knights on expeditions, even into foreign lands. Older pages were instructed by knights in swordsmanship, equestrianism, chivalry, warfare, and combat (using wooden swords and spears).\n\nSquire\nWhen the boy turned 14, he became a squire. In a religious ceremony, the new squire swore on a sword consecrated by a bishop or priest, and attended to assigned duties in his lord's household. During this time, the squires continued training in combat and were allowed to own armour (rather than borrowing it).Squires were required to master the seven points of agilities – riding, swimming and diving, shooting different types of weapons, climbing, participation in tournaments, wrestling, fencing, long jumping, and dancing – the prerequisite skills for knighthood. All of these were even performed while wearing armour.\nUpon turning 21, the squire was eligible to be knighted.\n\nAccolade\nThe accolade or knighting ceremony was usually held during one of the great feasts or holidays, like Christmas or Easter, and sometimes at the wedding of a noble or royal. The knighting ceremony usually involved a ritual bath on the eve of the ceremony and a prayer vigil during the night. On the day of the ceremony, the would-be knight would swear an oath and the master of the ceremony would dub the new knight on the shoulders with a sword. Squires, and even soldiers, could also be conferred direct knighthood early if they showed valor and efficiency for their service; such acts may include deploying for an important quest or mission, or protecting a high diplomat or a royal relative in battle.\n\nChivalric code\nKnights were expected, above all, to fight bravely and to display military professionalism and courtesy. When knights were taken as prisoners of war, they were customarily held for ransom in somewhat comfortable surroundings. This same standard of conduct did not apply to non-knights (archers, peasants, foot-soldiers, etc.) who were often slaughtered after capture, and who were viewed during battle as mere impediments to knights' getting to other knights to fight them.\nChivalry developed as an early standard of professional ethics for knights, who were relatively affluent horse owners and were expected to provide military services in exchange for landed property. Early notions of chivalry entailed loyalty to one's liege lord and bravery in battle, similar to the values of the Heroic Age. During the Middle Ages, this grew from simple military professionalism into a social code including the values of gentility, nobility and treating others reasonably. In The Song of Roland (c. 1100), Roland is portrayed as the ideal knight, demonstrating unwavering loyalty, military prowess and social fellowship. In Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival (c. 1205), chivalry had become a blend of religious duties, love and military service. Ramon Llull's Book of the Order of Chivalry (1275) demonstrates that by the end of the 13th century, chivalry entailed a litany of very specific duties, including riding warhorses, jousting, attending tournaments, holding Round Tables and hunting, as well as aspiring to the more æthereal virtues of \"faith, hope, charity, justice, strength, moderation and loyalty.\"\nKnights of the late medieval era were expected by society to maintain all these skills and many more, as outlined in Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, though the book's protagonist, Count Ludovico, states the \"first and true profession\" of the ideal courtier \"must be that of arms.\" Chivalry, derived from the French word chevalier ('cavalier'), simultaneously denoted skilled horsemanship and military service, and these remained the primary occupations of knighthood throughout the Middle Ages.\nChivalry and religion were mutually influenced during the period of the Crusades. The early Crusades helped to clarify the moral code of chivalry as it related to religion. As a result, Christian armies began to devote their efforts to sacred purposes. As time passed, clergy instituted religious vows which required knights to use their weapons chiefly for the protection of the weak and defenseless, especially women and orphans, and of churches.\n\nTournaments\nIn peacetime, knights often demonstrated their martial skills in tournaments, which usually took place on the grounds of a castle. Knights could parade their armour and banner to the whole court as the tournament commenced. Medieval tournaments were made up of martial sports called hastiludes, and were not only a major spectator sport but also played as a real combat simulation. It usually ended with many knights either injured or even killed. One contest was a free-for-all battle called a melee, where large groups of knights numbering hundreds assembled and fought one another, and the last knight standing was the winner. The most popular and romanticized contest for knights was the joust. In this competition, two knights charge each other with blunt wooden lances in an effort to break their lance on the opponent's head or body or unhorse them completely. The loser in these tournaments had to turn his armour and horse over to the victor. The last day was filled with feasting, dancing and minstrel singing.\nBesides formal tournaments, there were also unformalized judicial duels done by knights and squires to end various disputes. Countries like Germany, Britain and Ireland practiced this tradition. Judicial combat was of two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat. The feat of arms were done to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The chivalric combat was fought when one party's honor was disrespected or challenged and the conflict could not be resolved in court. Weapons were standardized and must be of the same caliber. The duel lasted until the other party was too weak to fight back and in early cases, the defeated party were then subsequently executed. Examples of these brutal duels were the judicial combat known as the Combat of the Thirty in 1351, and the trial by combat fought by Jean de Carrouges in 1386. A far more chivalric duel which became popular in the Late Middle Ages was the pas d'armes or \"passage of arms\". In this hastilude, a knight or a group of knights would claim a bridge, lane or city gate, and challenge other passing knights to fight or be disgraced. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.\n\nHeraldry\nOne of the greatest distinguishing marks of the knightly class was the flying of coloured banners, to display power and to distinguish knights in battle and in tournaments. Knights are generally armigerous (bearing a coat of arms), and indeed they played an essential role in the development of heraldry. As heavier armour, including enlarged shields and enclosed helmets, developed in the Middle Ages, the need for marks of identification arose, and with coloured shields and surcoats, coat armoury was born. Armorial rolls were created to record the knights of various regions or those who participated in various tournaments.\n\nEquipment\nKnights used a variety of weapons, including maces, axes and swords. Elements of the knightly armour included helmet, cuirass, gauntlet and shield.\nThe sword was a weapon designed to be used solely in combat; it was useless in hunting and impractical as a tool. Thus, the sword was a status symbol among the knightly class. Swords were effective against lightly armoured enemies, while maces and warhammers were more effective against heavily armoured ones.: 85–86 \nOne of the primary elements of a knight's armour was the shield, which could be used to block strikes and projectiles. Oval shields were used during the Dark Ages and were made of wooden boards that were roughly half an inch thick. Towards the end of the 10th century, oval shields were lengthened to cover the left knee of the mounted warrior, called the kite shield. The heater shield was used during the 13th and the first half of the 14th century. Around 1350, square shields called bouched shields appeared, which had a notch in which to place the couched lance.: 15 \nUntil the mid-14th century, knights wore mail armour as their main form of defence. Mail was extremely flexible and provided good protection against sword cuts, but weak against blunt weapons such as the mace and piercing weapons such as the lance. Padded undergarment known as aketon was worn to absorb shock damage and prevent chafing caused by mail. In hotter climates metal rings became too hot, so sleeveless surcoats were worn as a protection against the sun, and also to show their heraldic arms.: 15–17  This sort of coat also evolved to be tabards, waffenrocks and other garments with the arms of the wearer sewn into it.\nHelmets of the knight of the early periods usually were more open helms such as the nasal helmet, and later forms of the spangenhelm. The lack of more facial protection lead to the evolution of more enclosing helmets to be made in the late 12th to early 13th centuries, this eventually would evolve to make the great helm. Later forms of the bascinet, which was originally a small helm worn under the larger great helm, evolved to be worn solely, and would eventually have pivoted or hinged visors, the most popular was the hounskull, also known as the \"pig-face visor\".\nPlate armour first appeared in the 13th century, when plates were added onto the torso and mounted to a base of leather. This form of armour is known as a coat of plates, and was initially used over chain mail in the 13th and 14th centuries, at the time of Transitional armour. The torso was not the only part of the knight to receive this plate protection evolution, as the elbows and shoulders were covered with circular pieces of metal, commonly referred to as rondels, eventually evolving into the plate arm harness consisting of the rerebrace, vambrace, and spaulder or pauldron. The legs too were covered in plates, mainly on the shin, called schynbalds which later evolved to fully enclose the leg in the form of enclosed greaves. As for the upper legs, cuisses came about in the mid 14th century. Overall, plate armour offered better protection against piercing weapons such as arrows and especially bolts than mail armour did.: 15–17 Plate armor reached his peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, but was still used at the beginning of the 17th century by the first Cuirassiers like the London lobsters.\nKnights' horses were also armoured in later periods; caparisons were the first form of medieval horse coverage and was used much like the surcoat. Other armours, such as the facial armouring chanfron, were made for horses.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance chivalric literature\nKnights and the ideals of knighthood featured largely in medieval and Renaissance literature, and have secured a permanent place in literary romance. While chivalric romances abound, particularly notable literary portrayals of knighthood include The Song of Roland, Cantar de Mio Cid, The Twelve of England, Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale, Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, and Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, as well as Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur and other Arthurian tales (Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, the Pearl Poet's Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, etc.).\nGeoffrey of Monmouth's  Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), written in the 1130s, introduced the legend of King Arthur, which was to be important to the development of chivalric ideals in literature. Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (The Death of Arthur), written in 1469, was important in defining the ideal of chivalry, which is essential to the modern concept of the knight, as an elite warrior sworn to uphold the values of faith, loyalty, courage, and honour.\nInstructional literature was also created. Geoffroi de Charny's \"Book of Chivalry\" expounded upon the importance of Christian faith in every area of a knight's life, though still laying stress on the primarily military focus of knighthood.\nIn the early Renaissance greater emphasis was laid upon courtliness. The ideal courtier—the chivalrous knight—of Baldassarre Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier became a model of the ideal virtues of nobility.  Castiglione's tale took the form of a discussion among the nobility of the court of the Duke of Urbino, in which the characters determine that the ideal knight should be renowned not only for his bravery and prowess in battle, but also as a skilled dancer, athlete, singer and orator, and he should also be well-read in the humanities and classical Greek and Latin literature.\nLater Renaissance literature, such as Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, rejected the code of chivalry as unrealistic idealism.  The rise of Christian humanism in Renaissance literature demonstrated a marked departure from the chivalric romance of late medieval literature, and the chivalric ideal ceased to influence literature over successive centuries until it saw some pockets of revival in post-Victorian literature.\n\nDecline\nBy the mid to late 16th century, knights were quickly becoming obsolete as countries started creating their own standing armies that were faster to train, cheaper to equip, and easier to mobilize. The advancement of high-powered firearms contributed greatly to the decline in use of plate armour, as the time it took to train soldiers with guns was much less compared to that of the knight. The cost of equipment was also significantly lower, and guns had a reasonable chance to easily penetrate a knight's armour. In the 14th century the use of infantrymen armed with pikes and fighting in close formation also proved effective against heavy cavalry, such as during the Battle of Nancy, when Charles the Bold and his armoured cavalry were decimated by Swiss pikemen. As the feudal system came to an end, lords saw no further use of knights. Many landowners found the duties of knighthood too expensive and so contented themselves with the use of squires. Mercenaries also became an economic alternative to knights when conflicts arose.\nArmies of the time started adopting a more realistic approach to warfare than the honor-bound code of chivalry. Soon, the remaining knights were absorbed into professional armies. Although they had a higher rank than most soldiers because of their valuable lineage, they lost their distinctive identity that previously set them apart from common soldiers. Some knightly orders survived into modern times. They adopted newer technology while still retaining their age-old chivalric traditions. Examples include the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, Knights Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights.\n\nTypes of knighthood\nHereditary knighthoods\nContinental Europe\nIn continental Europe different systems of hereditary knighthood have existed or do exist.\nIn the Kingdom of Spain, the Royal House of Spain grants titles of knighthood to the successor of the throne. This knighthood title, known as Order of the Golden Fleece, is probably the most prestigious and exclusive chivalric order. This order can also be granted to persons not belonging to the Spanish Crown, as the former Emperor of Japan Akihito, Queen of United Kingdom Elizabeth II or the relevant Spanish politician of the Spanish democratic transition Adolfo Suárez, among others.\nRidder, Dutch for \"knight\", is a hereditary noble title in the Netherlands. It is the lowest title within the nobility system and ranks below that of \"Baron\" but above \"Jonkheer\" (the latter is not a title, but a Dutch honorific to show that someone belongs to the untitled nobility). The collective term for its holders in a certain locality is the Ridderschap (e.g. Ridderschap van Holland, Ridderschap van Friesland, etc.). In the Netherlands no female equivalent exists. Before 1814, the history of nobility is separate for each of the eleven provinces that make up the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In each of these, there were in the early Middle Ages a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so than the rulers themselves. During this period, knights ranked below the ruler and above the feudal barons (Dutch: heren). In the Netherlands only 10 knightly families are still extant, a number which steadily decreases because in that country ennoblement or incorporation into the nobility is not possible anymore.\n\nLikewise Ridder, Dutch for \"knight\", or the equivalent French Chevalier is a hereditary noble title in Belgium. It is the second lowest title within the nobility system above Écuyer or Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw and below Baron. Like in the Netherlands, no female equivalent to the title exists. Belgium still does have about 232 registered knightly families.\nThe German and Austrian equivalent of an hereditary knight is a Ritter. This designation is used as a title of nobility in all German-speaking areas. Traditionally it denotes the second lowest rank within the nobility, standing above \"Edler\" (noble) and below \"Freiherr\" (baron). For its historical association with warfare and the landed gentry in the Middle Ages, it can be considered roughly equal to the titles of \"Knight\" or \"Baronet\".\nThe Royal House of Portugal historically bestowed hereditary knighthoods to holders of the highest ranks in the Royal Orders. Today, the head of the Royal House of Portugal Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, bestows hereditary knighthoods for extraordinary acts of sacrifice and service to the Royal House. There are very few hereditary knights and they are entitled to wear an oval neck badge with the shield of the house of Braganza. As there are two classes of hereditary knights in Portugal, the highest grade is the hereditary knight with grand collar. Portuguese hereditary knighthoods confer nobility. \nIn France, the hereditary knighthood existed similarly throughout as a title of nobility, as well as in regions formerly under Holy Roman Empire control. One family ennobled with a title in such a manner is the house of Hauteclocque (by letters patents of 1752), even if its most recent members used a pontifical title of count. In some other regions such as Normandy, a specific type of fief was granted to the lower ranked knights (French: chevaliers) called the fief de haubert, referring to the hauberk, or chain mail shirt  worn almost daily by knights, as they would not only fight for their liege lords, but enforce and carry out their orders on a routine basis as well. Later the term came to officially designate the higher rank of the nobility in the Ancien Régime (the lower rank being Squire), as the romanticism and prestige associated with the term grew in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\nItaly and Poland also had the hereditary knighthood that existed within their respective systems of nobility. Just as with the Royal House of Portugal, the Royal House of Italy - House of Savoy, continue to confer their dynastic orders of chivalry on both Italian and non-Italian citizens, these dynastic orders include the; Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and the Civil Order of Savoy. Additionally the Royal House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies confers their dynastic orders of chivalry on both Italian and non-italian citizens, including the dynastic orders of; Order of Saint Januarius, Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George, and the Order of Saint Ferdinand and of Merit.\n\nIreland\nThere are traces of the Continental system of hereditary knighthood in Ireland. Notably all three of the following belong to the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, created by the Earls of Desmond, acting as Earls Palatine, for their kinsmen.\n\nKnight of Kerry or Green Knight (FitzGerald of Kerry) — the current holder is Sir Adrian FitzGerald, 6th Baronet of Valencia, 24th Knight of Kerry. He is also a Knight of Malta, and has served as President of the Irish Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\nKnight of Glin or Black Knight (FitzGerald of Limerick) — now dormant.\nWhite Knight (see Edmund Fitzgibbon) — now dormant.\nAnother Irish family were the O'Shaughnessys, who were created knights in 1553 under the policy of surrender and regrant (first established by Henry VIII of England). They were attainted in 1697 for participation on the Jacobite side in the Williamite wars.\n\nBritish baronetcies\nSince 1611, the British Crown has awarded a hereditary title in the form of the baronetcy. Like knights, baronets are accorded the title Sir. Baronets are not peers of the Realm, and have never been entitled to sit in the House of Lords, therefore like knights they remain commoners in the view of the British legal system. However, unlike knights, the title is hereditary and the recipient does not receive an accolade. The position is therefore more comparable with hereditary knighthoods in continental European orders of nobility, such as Ritter, than with knighthoods under the British orders of chivalry. However, unlike the continental orders, the British baronetcy system was a modern invention, designed specifically to raise money for the Crown with the purchase of the title.\n\nChivalric orders\nMilitary orders\nSovereign Military Order of Malta founded to provide military medical services in 1048\nOrder of the Holy Sepulchre, founded very shortly after the First Crusade in 1099\nOrder of Saint Lazarus established to serve and protect lepers on/about 1100\nKnights Templar, founded 1118, disbanded 1307\nTeutonic Knights, established about 1190, and ruled the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia until 1525\nOther orders were established in the Iberian peninsula, under the influence of the orders in the Holy Land and the Crusader movement of the Reconquista and generally aligned with geographical area, for example:\n\nOrder of Aviz, established in Avis (Portugal) in 1143\nOrder of Alcántara, established in Alcántara (Spain) in 1156\nOrder of Calatrava, established in Calatrava (Spain) in 1158\nOrder of Santiago, established in Santiago (Spain) in 1164.\n\nHonorific orders of knighthood\nAfter the Crusades, the military orders became idealized and romanticized, resulting in the late medieval notion of chivalry, as reflected in the chivalric romances of the time. The creation of chivalric orders was fashionable among the nobility in the 14th and 15th centuries, and this is still reflected in contemporary honours systems, including the term order itself. Examples of notable orders of chivalry are:\n\nthe Order of Saint George, founded by Charles I of Hungary in 1326\nthe Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, founded by Count Amadeus VI in 1362\nthe Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III of England in 1348\nthe Order of the Dragon, founded by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1408\nthe Order of the Golden Fleece, founded by Philip III, Duke of Burgundy in 1430\nthe Order of Saint Michael, founded by Louis XI of France in 1469\nthe Order of the Thistle, founded by King James VII of Scotland (also known as James II of England) in 1687\nthe Order of the Elephant, which may have been first founded by Christian I of Denmark, but was founded in its current form by King Christian V in 1693\nthe Order of the Bath, founded by George I in 1725\n\nFrom roughly 1560, purely honorific orders were established, as a way to confer prestige and distinction, unrelated to military service and chivalry in the more narrow sense. Such orders were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and knighthood continues to be conferred in various countries:\n\nThe United Kingdom using the British honours system and some Commonwealth of Nations countries such as New Zealand;\nSome European countries, such as The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain among others (see below). The Order of Charles III, the Order of Isabella the Catholic, and the Order of Civil Merit are Spain's highest civil honours.\nThe Holy See implementing the Papal Orders of Chivalry.\nThere are other monarchies and also republics that also follow this practice. Modern knighthoods are typically conferred in recognition for services rendered to society, which are not necessarily martial in nature. The British musician Elton John, for example, is a Knight Bachelor, thus entitled to be called Sir Elton. The female equivalent is a Dame, for example Dame Julie Andrews.\nIn the United Kingdom, honorific knighthood may be conferred in two different ways:\n\nThe first is by membership of one of the pure orders of chivalry such as the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of Saint Patrick, of which all members are knighted. In addition, many British orders of merit, namely the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire are part of the British honours system, and the award of their highest ranks (Knight/Dame Commander and Knight/Dame Grand Cross), comes together with an honorific knighthood, making them a cross between orders of chivalry and orders of merit. By contrast, membership of other British orders of merit, such as the Distinguished Service Order, the Order of Merit and the Order of the Companions of Honour does not confer a knighthood.\nThe second is being granted honorific knighthood by the British sovereign without membership of an order, the recipient being called Knight Bachelor.\nIn the British honours system the knightly style of Sir and its female equivalent Dame are followed by the given name only when addressing the holder. Thus, Sir Elton John should be addressed as Sir Elton, not Sir John or Mr John. Similarly, actress Dame Judi Dench should be addressed as Dame Judi, not Dame Dench or Ms Dench.\nWives of knights, however, are entitled to the honorific pre-nominal \"Lady\" before their husband's surname. Thus Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife was formally styled Lady McCartney (rather than Lady Paul McCartney or Lady Heather McCartney). The style Dame Heather McCartney could be used for the wife of a knight; however, this style is largely archaic and is only used in the most formal of documents, or where the wife is a Dame in her own right (such as Dame Norma Major, who gained her title six years before her husband Sir John Major was knighted). The husbands of Dames have no honorific pre-nominal, so Dame Norma's husband remained John Major until he received his own knighthood.\nUp until 1965 it was not permitted to use these titles until after the knight concerned had received the accolade; but in that year the prohibition was lifted, and it is now permitted to use the titles immediately, from the time the award is gazetted.\n\n \nWith the award of a KCVO to the Rt Rev. Randall Davidson in 1902, the custom was established whereby a clerk in holy orders in the Church of England, on being appointed to a degree of knighthood, does not received the accolade. He receives the insignia of his honour and may place the appropriate letters after his name or title but he may not be called Sir and his wife may not be called Lady. This custom is not observed in Australia and New Zealand, where knighted Anglican clergymen routinely use the title \"Sir\". Ministers of other Christian Churches are entitled to receive the accolade. For example, Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy did receive the accolade on his appointment as Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1969. A knight who is subsequently ordained does not lose his title. A famous example of this situation was The Revd Sir Derek Pattinson, who was ordained just a year after he was appointed Knight Bachelor, apparently somewhat to the consternation of officials at Buckingham Palace. A woman clerk in holy orders may be made a Dame in exactly the same way as any other woman since there are no military connotations attached to the honour. A clerk in holy orders who is a baronet is entitled to use the title Sir.\nOutside the British honours system it is usually considered improper to address a knighted person as 'Sir' or 'Dame' (notable exceptions are members of the Order of the Knights of Rizal in the Republic of the Philippines.) Some countries, however, historically did have equivalent honorifics for knights, such as Cavaliere in Italy (e.g. Cavaliere Benito Mussolini), and Ritter in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (e.g. Georg Ritter von Trapp).\n\nState knighthoods in the Netherlands are issued in three orders: the Order of William, the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and the Order of Orange Nassau. Additionally there remain a few hereditary knights in the Netherlands.\nIn Belgium, honorific knighthood (not hereditary) can be conferred by the king on particularly meritorious individuals such as scientists or eminent businessmen, or for instance to astronaut Frank De Winne, the second Belgian in space. This practice is similar to the conferral of the dignity of Knight Bachelor in the United Kingdom. In addition, there still are a number of hereditary knights in Belgium (see below).\nIn France and Belgium, one of the ranks conferred in some orders of merit, such as the Légion d'Honneur, the Ordre National du Mérite, the Ordre des Palmes académiques and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France, and the Order of Leopold, Order of the Crown and Order of Leopold II in Belgium, is that of Chevalier (in French) or Ridder (in Dutch), meaning Knight.\nIn the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the monarchs tried to establish chivalric orders, but the hereditary lords who controlled the Union did not agree and managed to ban such assemblies. They feared the king would use orders to gain support for absolutist goals and to make formal distinctions among the peerage, which could lead to its legal breakup into two separate classes, and that the king would later play one against the other and eventually limit the legal privileges of hereditary nobility. But finally in 1705 King August II managed to establish the Order of the White Eagle which remains Poland's most prestigious order of that kind. The head of state (now the President as the acting Grand Master) confers knighthoods of the order to distinguished citizens, foreign monarchs and other heads of state. The order has its chapter. There were no particular honorifics that would accompany a knight's name, as historically all (or at least by far most) of its members would be royals or hereditary lords anyway. So today, a knight is simply referred to as \"Name Surname, knight of the White Eagle (Order)\".\nIn Nigeria, holders of religious honours like the Knighthood of St. Gregory make use of the word Sir as a pre-nominal honorific in much the same way as it is used for secular purposes in Britain and the Philippines. Wives of such individuals also typically assume the title of Lady.\n\nWomen\nEngland and the United Kingdom\nWomen were appointed to the Order of the Garter almost from the start. In all, 68 women were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments of women are known, although it is said that the Garter was conferred upon Neapolitan poet Laura Bacio Terricina, by King Edward VI. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but this did not occur. Queens consort have been made Ladies of the Garter since 1901 (Queens Alexandra in 1901, Mary in 1910 and Elizabeth in 1937). The first non-royal woman to be made Lady Companion of the Garter was The Duchess of Norfolk in 1990, the second was The Baroness Thatcher in 1995 (post-nominal: LG). On 30 November 1996, Lady Fraser was made Lady of the Thistle, the first non-royal woman (post-nominal: LT). (See Edmund Fellowes, Knights of the Garter, 1939; and Beltz: Memorials of the Order of the Garter). The first woman to be granted a knighthood in modern Britain seems to have been Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal, who became a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1861, at the foundation of the order. Her daughter received the same honor in 1872, as well as her granddaughter in 1910. The order was open to \"princes and chiefs\" without distinction of gender. The first European woman to have been granted an order of knighthood was Queen Mary, when she was made a Knight Grand Commander of the same order, by special statute, in celebration of the Delhi Durbar of 1911. She was also granted a damehood in 1917 as a Dame Grand Cross, when the Order of the British Empire was created (it was the first order explicitly open to women). The Royal Victorian Order was opened to women in 1936, and the Orders of the Bath and Saint Michael and Saint George in 1965 and 1971 respectively.\n\nFrance\nMedieval French had two words, chevaleresse and chevalière, which were used in two ways: one was for the wife of a knight, and this usage goes back to the 14th century. The other was possibly for a female knight. Here is a quote from Ménestrier, a 17th-century writer on chivalry: It was not always necessary to be the wife of a knight in order to take this title. Sometimes, when some male fiefs were conceded by special privilege to women, they took the rank of chevaleresse, as one sees plainly in Hemricourt where women who were not wives of knights are called chevaleresses.Modern French orders of knighthood include women, for example the Légion d'Honneur (Legion of Honor) since the mid-19th century, but they are usually called chevaliers. The first documented case is that of Angélique Brûlon (1772–1859), who fought in the Revolutionary Wars, received a military disability pension in 1798, the rank of 2nd lieutenant in 1822, and the Legion of Honor in 1852. A recipient of the Ordre National du Mérite recently requested from the order's Chancery the permission to call herself \"chevalière,\" and the request was granted.\n\nItaly\nAs related in Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See by H. E. Cardinale (1983), the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary was founded by two Bolognese nobles Loderingo degli Andalò and Catalano di Guido in 1233, and approved by Pope Alexander IV in 1261. It was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of militissa to women. However, this order was suppressed by Pope Sixtus V in 1558.\n\nThe Low Countries\nAt the initiative of Catherine Baw in 1441, and 10 years later of Elizabeth, Mary, and Isabella of the house of Hornes, orders were founded which were open exclusively to women of noble birth, who received the French title of chevalière or the Latin title of equitissa. In his Glossarium (s.v. militissa), Du Cange notes that still in his day (17th century), the female canons of the canonical monastery of St. Gertrude in Nivelles (Brabant), after a probation of 3 years, are made knights (militissae) at the altar, by a (male) knight called in for that purpose, who gives them the accolade with a sword and pronounces the usual words.\n\nSpain\nTo honour those women who defended Tortosa against an attack by the Moors, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, created the Order of the Hatchet (\"Orde de la Atxa\" in catalan) in 1149.\n\nThe inhabitants [of Tortosa] being at length reduced to great streights, desired relief of the Earl, but he, being not in a condition to give them any, they entertained some thoughts of making a surrender. Which the Women hearing of, to prevent the disaster threatening their City, themselves, and Children, put on men's Clothes, and by a resolute sally, forced the Moors to raise the Siege. The Earl, finding himself obliged, by the gallentry of the action, thought fit to make his acknowlegements thereof, by granting them several Privileges and Immunities, and to perpetuate the memory of so signal an attempt, instituted an Order, somewhat like a Military Order, into which were admitted only those Brave Women, deriving the honour to their Descendants, and assigned them for a Badge, a thing like a Fryars Capouche, sharp at the top, after the form of a Torch, and of a crimson colour, to be worn upon their Head-clothes. He also ordained, that at all publick meetings, the women should have precedence of the Men. That they should be exempted from all Taxes, and that all the Apparel and Jewels, though of never so great value, left by their dead Husbands, should be their own. These Women having thus acquired this Honour by their personal Valour, carried themselves after the Military Knights of those days.\n\nNotable knights\nSee also\nCounterparts in other cultures\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "streamer": "GURU",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru",
        "content": "Guru ( Sanskrit: गुरु; IAST: guru) is a Sanskrit term for a \"mentor, guide, expert, or master\" of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, a guru is more than a teacher: traditionally, the guru is a reverential figure to the disciple (or shisya in Sanskrit, literally seeker [of knowledge or truth]) or student, with the guru serving as a \"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student\". Whatever language it is written in, Judith Simmer-Brown says that a tantric spiritual text is often codified in an obscure twilight language so that it cannot be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher, the guru. A guru is also one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the guru has already realized.\nThe oldest references to the concept of guru are found in the earliest Vedic texts of Hinduism. The guru, and gurukula – a school run by guru, were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE, and these helped compose and transmit the various Vedas, the Upanishads, texts of various schools of Hindu philosophy, and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts so also specific science and technology. By about mid 1st millennium CE, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of gurus existed in India, some near Hindu temples, where guru-shishya tradition helped preserve, create and transmit various fields of knowledge. These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures, Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.\nThe tradition of the guru is also found in Jainism, referring to a spiritual preceptor, a role typically served by a Jain ascetic. In Sikhism, the guru tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century, its founder is referred to as Guru Nanak, and its scripture as Guru Granth Sahib. The guru concept has thrived in Vajrayāna Buddhism, where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.\n\nDefinition and etymology\nThe word guru (Sanskrit: गुरु), a noun, connotes \"teacher\" in Sanskrit, but in ancient Indian traditions it has contextual meanings with significance beyond what teacher means in English. The guru is more than someone who teaches a specific type of knowledge, and included in the term's scope is someone who is also a \"counselor, a sort of parent of mind (Citta) and Self (Atman), who helps mold values (Yamas and Niyamas) and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.\" The word has the same meaning in other languages derived from or borrowing words from Sanskrit, such as Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Bengali, Gujarati and Nepali. The Malayalam term Acharyan or Asan is derived from the Sanskrit word Acharya.\nAs a noun the word means the imparter of knowledge (jñāna; also Pali: ñāna). As an adjective, it means 'heavy,' or 'weighty,' in the sense of \"heavy with knowledge,\" heavy with spiritual wisdom, \"heavy with spiritual weight,\" \"heavy with the good qualities of scriptures and realization,\" or \"heavy with a wealth of knowledge.\" The word has its roots in the Sanskrit gri (to invoke, or to praise), and may have a connection to the word gur, meaning 'to raise, lift up, or to make an effort'.\nSanskrit guru is cognate with Latin gravis 'heavy; grave, weighty, serious' and Greek βαρύς barus 'heavy'. All three derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *gʷerə-, specifically from the zero-grade form *gʷr̥ə-.\n\nDarkness and light\nA popular etymological theory considers the term \"guru\" to be based on the syllables gu (गु) and ru (रु), which it claims stands for darkness and \"light that dispels it\", respectively. The guru is seen as the one who \"dispels the darkness of ignorance.\"\nReender Kranenborg disagrees, stating that darkness and light have nothing to do with the word guru. He describes this as a folk etymology.\nJoel Mlecko states, \"Gu means ignorance, and Ru means dispeller,\" with guru meaning the one who \"dispels ignorance, all kinds of ignorance\", ranging from spiritual to skills such as dancing, music, sports and others. Karen Pechilis states that, in the popular parlance, the \"dispeller of darkness, one who points the way\" definition for guru is common in the Indian tradition.\nIn Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion, Pierre Riffard makes a distinction between \"occult\" and \"scientific\" etymologies, citing as an example of the former the etymology of 'guru' in which the derivation is presented as gu (\"darkness\") and ru ('to push away'); the latter he exemplifies by \"guru\" with the meaning of 'heavy.'\n\nIn Hinduism\nThe Guru is an ancient and central figure in the traditions of Hinduism. Ultimate liberation or moksha and inner perfection is considered achievable in Hinduism with the help of a guru. The Guru can also serve as a teacher of skills, a counselor, one who helps in the realization of one's Self (Atma), who instills values and experiential knowledge, an exemplar, an inspiration and one who helps guide a student's (śiṣya) spiritual development. At a social and religious level, the Guru helps continue the religion and Hindu way of life. Guru thus has a historic, reverential and an important role in the Hindu culture.\n\nScriptures\nThe word Guru is mentioned in the earliest layer of Vedic texts. The hymn 4.5.6 of Rigveda describes the guru as, \"the source and inspirer of the knowledge of the Self, the essence of reality,\" for one who seeks.\nIn chapter 4.4 within the Chandogya Upanishad, a guru is described as one whom one attains knowledge that matters, the insights that lead to Self-knowledge. Verse 1.2.8 of the Katha Upanisad declares the guru \"as indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge.\" In chapter 3 of Taittiriya Upanishad, human knowledge is described as that which connects the teacher and the student through the medium of exposition, just like a child is the connecting link between the father and the mother through the medium of procreation. In the Taittiriya Upanishad, the guru then urges a student to \"struggle, discover and experience the Truth, which is the source, stay and end of the universe.\"\nThe ancient tradition of reverence for the guru in Hindu scriptures is apparent in 6.23 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which equates the need of reverence and devotion for guru to be the same as for god,\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita also exemplifies the importance of a guru within Hinduism. Arjuna when faced with the realization of having to wage war with his kin is paralyzed with grief and remorse. Overwhelmed he lays down his weapons and refuses to fight. Despite his intellectual prowess and skill in warfare he finds himself lacking in Dharmic (moral) clarity. At this moment he turns to Krishna for guidance and in essence seeks Krishna as his guru. This interaction exemplifies the importance within the Hindu tradition for a disciple to seek guidance from an experienced spiritual guru. Additionally, other references to the role of a guru in the Bhagavad Gita include verse 4.34 - those who know their subject well are eager for good students, and the student can learn from such a guru through reverence, service, effort and the process of inquiry.\n\nCapabilities, role and methods for helping a student\nThe 8th century Hindu text Upadesasahasri of the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara discusses the role of the guru in assessing and guiding students. In Chapter 1, he states that teacher is the pilot as the student walks in the journey of knowledge, he is the raft as the student rows. The text describes the need, role and characteristics of a teacher, as follows,\n\nWhen the teacher finds from signs that knowledge has not been grasped or has been wrongly grasped by the student, he should remove the causes of non-comprehension in the student. This includes the student's past and present knowledge, want of previous knowledge of what constitutes subjects of discrimination and rules of reasoning, behavior such as unrestrained conduct and speech, courting popularity, vanity of his parentage, ethical flaws that are means contrary to those causes. The teacher must enjoin means in the student that are enjoined by the Śruti and Smrti, such as avoidance of anger, Yamas consisting of Ahimsa and others, also the rules of conduct that are not inconsistent with knowledge. He [teacher] should also thoroughly impress upon the student qualities like humility, which are the means to knowledge.\n\n \nThe teacher is one who is endowed with the power of furnishing arguments pro and con, of understanding questions [of the student], and remembers them. The teacher possesses tranquility, self-control, compassion and a desire to help others, who is versed in the Śruti texts (Vedas, Upanishads), and unattached to pleasures here and hereafter, knows the subject and is established in that knowledge. He is never a transgressor of the rules of conduct, devoid of weaknesses such as ostentation, pride, deceit, cunning, jugglery, jealousy, falsehood, egotism and attachment. The teacher's sole aim is to help others and a desire to impart the knowledge.\n\nAdi Shankara presents a series of examples wherein he asserts that the best way to guide a student is not to give immediate answers, but posit dialogue-driven questions that enable the student to discover and understand the answer.\n\nReverence and Guru-Bhakti\nReverence for the guru is a fundamental principle in Hinduism, as illustrated in the Guru Gita by the following shloka \n\nगुरु ब्रह्मा गुरु विष्णु गुरु देवो महेश्वरः।\nगुरु साक्षात् परम ब्रह्म तस्मै श्री गुरुवे नमः।\nTransliteration: Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara,\nGuru Sakshat Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah.\n\nMeaning: This shloka praises the Guru, identifying them as the creator (Brahma), the preserver (Vishnu), and the destroyer (Shiva), ultimately recognizing the Guru as the supreme reality.Other notable examples of devotion to the guru within Hinduism include the religious festival of Guru Purnima.\n\nGurukula and the guru-shishya tradition\nTraditionally, the Guru would live a simple married life, and accept shishya (student, Sanskrit: शिष्य) where he lived. A person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula (the household of the Guru). The process of acceptance included proffering firewood and sometimes a gift to the guru, signifying that the student wants to live with, work and help the guru in maintaining the gurukul, and as an expression of a desire for education in return over several years. At the Gurukul, the working student would study the basic traditional vedic sciences and various practical skills-oriented shastras along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. The education stage of a youth with a guru was referred to as Brahmacharya, and in some parts of India this followed the Upanayana or Vidyarambha rites of passage.\nThe gurukul would be a hut in a forest, or it was, in some cases, a monastery, called a matha or ashram or sampradaya in different parts of India. Each ashram had a lineage of gurus, who would study and focus on certain schools of Hindu philosophy or trade, also known as the guru-shishya parampara (teacher-student tradition). This guru-driven tradition included arts such as sculpture, poetry and music.\nInscriptions from 4th century CE suggest the existence of gurukuls around Hindu temples, called Ghatikas or Mathas, where the Vedas were studied. In south India, 9th century Vedic schools attached to Hindu temples were called Calai or Salai, and these provided free boarding and lodging to students and scholars. Archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggests that ancient and medieval era gurukuls near Hindu temples offered wide range of studies, ranging from Hindu scriptures to Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.\nThe guru-shishya parampara, occurs where knowledge is passed down through succeeding generations. It is the traditional, residential form of education, where the Shishya remains and learns with his Guru as a family member.\n\nGender and caste\nThe Hindu texts offer a conflicting view of whether access to guru and education was limited to men and to certain varna (castes). The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or varna. The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state that knowledge is for everyone, and offer examples of women and people from all segments of society who are guru and participated in vedic studies. The Upanishads assert that one's birth does not determine one's eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one's effort and sincerity matters.\nThe early Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras, such as Paraskara Grhyasutra, Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya smriti, state all four varnas are eligible to all fields of knowledge while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas, unavailable to Shudra and women. Kramrisch, Scharfe, and Mookerji state that the guru tradition and availability of education extended to all segments of ancient and medieval society. Lise McKean states the guru concept has been prevalent over the range of class and caste backgrounds, and the disciples a guru attracts come from both genders and a range of classes and castes. During the bhakti movement of Hinduism, which started in about mid 1st millennium CE, the gurus included women and members of all varna.\n\nAttributes\nThe Advayataraka Upanishad states that the true teacher is a master in the field of knowledge, well-versed in the Vedas, is free from envy, knows yoga, lives a simple life that of a yogi, has realized the knowledge of the Atman (Self). Some scriptures and gurus have warned against false teachers, and have recommended that the spiritual seeker test the guru before accepting him.  Swami Vivekananda said that there are many incompetent gurus, and that a true guru should understand the spirit of the scriptures, have a pure character and be free from sin, and should be selfless, without desire for money and fame.\nAccording to the Indologist Georg Feuerstein, in some traditions of Hinduism, when one reaches the state of Self-knowledge, one's own Self becomes the guru. In Tantra, states Feuerstein, the guru is the \"ferry who leads one across the ocean of existence.\" A true guru guides and counsels a student's spiritual development because, states Yoga-Bija, endless logic and grammar leads to confusion, and not contentment. However, various Hindu texts caution prudence and diligence in finding the right guru, and avoiding the wrong ones. For example, in Kula-Arnava text states the following guidance:\n\nA true guru is, asserts Kula-Arnava, one who lives the simple virtuous life he preaches, is stable and firm in his knowledge, master yogi with the knowledge of Self (Atma Gyaan) and Brahman (ultimate reality). The guru is one who initiates, transmits, guides, illuminates, debates and corrects a student in the journey of knowledge and of self-realization. The attribute of the successful guru is to help make the disciple into another guru, one who transcends him, and becomes a guru unto himself, driven by inner spirituality and principles.\n\nIn modern Hinduism\nIn modern neo-Hinduism, Kranenborg states guru may refer to entirely different concepts, such as a spiritual advisor, or someone who performs traditional rituals outside a temple, or an enlightened master in the field of tantra or yoga or eastern arts who derives his authority from his experience, or a reference by a group of devotees of a sect to someone considered a god-like Avatar by the sect.\nThe tradition of reverence for guru continues in several denominations within modern Hinduism, but rather than being considered as a prophet, the guru is seen as a person who points the way to spirituality, oneness of being, and meaning in life.\n\nIn Buddhism\nIn some forms of Buddhism, states Rita Gross, the concept of Guru is of supreme importance. Guru is called as Garu in Pali. The Guru is the teacher, who teaches the spiritual and religious knowledge. Guru can be anyone who teach this knowledge and not generally need to be Acariya or Upajjhaya. Guru can also be a personal teacher. Buddha is called as Lokagaru, meaning \"the teacher of the world\".\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism's Tantric teachings, the rituals require the guidance of a guru. The guru is considered essential and to the Buddhist devotee, the guru is the \"enlightened teacher and ritual master\", states Stephen Berkwitz. The guru is known as the vajra guru (literally \"diamond guru\"). Initiations or ritual empowerments are necessary before the student is permitted to practice a particular tantra, in Vajrayana Buddhist sects found in Tibet and South Asia. The tantras state that the guru is equivalent to Buddha, states Berkwitz, and is a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.\n\nThe guru is the Buddha, the guru is the Dhamma, and the guru is the Sangha. The guru is the glorious Vajradhara, in this life only the guru is the means [to awakening]. Therefore, someone wishing to attain the state of Buddhahood should please the guru.\n\nThere are Four Kinds of Lama (Guru) or spiritual teacher (Tib. lama nampa shyi) in Tibetan Buddhism:\n\ngangzak gyüpé lama — the individual teacher who is the holder of the lineage\ngyalwa ka yi lama — the teacher which is the word of the buddhas\nnangwa da yi lama — the symbolic teacher of all appearances\nrigpa dön gyi lama — the absolute teacher, which is rigpa, the true nature of mind\nIn various Buddhist traditions, there are equivalent words for guru, which include Shastri (teacher), Kalyana Mitra (friendly guide, Pali: Kalyāṇa-mittatā), Acarya (master), and Vajra-Acarya (hierophant). The guru is literally understood as \"weighty\", states Alex Wayman, and it refers to the Buddhist tendency to increase the weight of canons and scriptures with their spiritual studies. In Mahayana Buddhism, a term for Buddha is Bhaisajya guru, which refers to \"medicine guru\", or \"a doctor who cures suffering with the medicine of his teachings\".\n\nIn Jainism\nGuru is the spiritual preceptor in Jainism, and typically a role served by Jain ascetics. The guru is one of three fundamental tattva (categories), the other two being dharma (teachings) and deva (divinity). The guru-tattva is what leads a lay person to the other two tattva. In some communities of the Śvētāmbara sect of Jainism, a traditional system of guru-disciple lineage exists.\nThe guru is revered in Jainism ritually with Guru-vandan or Guru-upashti, where respect and offerings are made to the guru, and the guru sprinkles a small amount of vaskep (a scented powder mixture of sandalwood, saffron, and camphor) on the devotee's head with a mantra or blessings.\n\nIn Sikhism\nIn Sikhism, seeking a Guru (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ gurū) is of the utmost importance, Guru Nanak writes in Ang (ਅੰਗ):751 (੫੧ of the Guru Granth Sahib:ਗਾਫਲ ਗਿਆਨ ਵਿਹੂਣਿਆ ਗੁਰ ਬਿਨੁ ਗਿਆਨੁ ਨ ਭਾਲਿ ਜੀਉ ॥\nO foolish mind, without seeking a Guru, loving devotion with the Almighty is not possible.Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru says knowledge will have no foundation without a Guru\nThe Guru is the source of all knowledge which is Almighty. In Chaupai Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh states about who is the Guru:\n\nThe Sikh gurus were fundamental to the Sikh religion, however the concept in Sikhism differs from other usages. The Punjabi word Sikh derives from the Sanskrit word shishya, or disciple and is all about the relationship between the teacher and a student. The concept of Guru in Sikhism stands on two pillars i.e. Miri-Piri (ਮੀਰੀ-ਪੀਰੀ). 'Piri' means spiritual authority and 'Miri' means temporal authority. Traditionally, the concept of Guru is considered central in Sikhism, and its main scripture is prefixed as a Guru, called Guru Granth Sahib, the words therein called Gurbani.\n\nIn Western culture\nAs an alternative to established religions in the West, some people in Europe and the US looked to spiritual guides and gurus from India and other countries. Gurus from many denominations traveled to Western Europe and the US and established followings.\nIn particular during the 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the US. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially due to the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the US. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values.\nIn the Western world, the term is sometimes used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers' naiveté, particularly in certain cults or groups in the fields of hippie, new religious movements, self-help, and tantra.\nAccording to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), one of the reasons why in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the US then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demanding lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.\nSome gurus and the groups they lead attract opposition from the Anti-Cult Movement. According to Kranenborg (1984), Jesus Christ fits the Hindu definition and characteristics of a guru.\nEnvironmental activists are sometimes called \"gurus\" or \"prophets\" for embodying a moral or spiritual authority and gathering followers. Examples of environmental gurus are John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, George Perkins Marsh, and David Attenborough. Abidin et al. wrote that environmental gurus \"merge the boundaries\" between spiritual and scientific authority.\n\nViewpoints\nGurus and the Guru-shishya tradition have been criticized and assessed by secular scholars, theologians, anti-cultists, skeptics, and religious philosophers.\nJiddu Krishnamurti, groomed to be a world spiritual teacher by the leadership of the Theosophical Society in the early part of the 20th century, publicly renounced this role in 1929 while also denouncing the concept of gurus, spiritual leaders, and teachers, advocating instead the unmediated and direct investigation of reality.\nU. G. Krishnamurti, [no relation to Jiddu], sometimes characterized as a spiritual anarchist, denied both the value of gurus and the existence of any related worthwhile teaching.\nDr. David C. Lane proposes a checklist consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have high standards of moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret the behavior of a spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are likely to be more unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.\nHighlighting what he sees as the difficulty in understanding the guru from Eastern tradition in Western society, Indologist Georg Feuerstein writes in the chapter Understanding the Guru in his book The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and practice: \"The traditional role of the guru, or spiritual teacher, is not widely understood in the West, even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship. [...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not even about morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this kind of message is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing\". In his Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of yoga to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.\nA British professor of psychiatry, Anthony Storr, states in his book, Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus, that he confines the word guru (translated by him as \"revered teacher\") to persons who have \"special knowledge\" who tell, referring to their special knowledge, how other people should lead their lives. He argues that gurus share common character traits (e.g. being loners) and that some suffer from a mild form of schizophrenia. He argues that gurus who are authoritarian, paranoid, eloquent, or who interfere in the private lives of their followers are the ones who are more likely to be unreliable and dangerous. Storr also refers to Eileen Barker's checklist to recognize false gurus. He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation, offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation. Storr's criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them, though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so. He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of psychosis to make sense of their own minds and perceptions, and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone. Storr notes that gurus generalize their experience to all people. Some of them believe that all humanity should accept their vision, while others teach that when the end of the world comes, only their followers will be saved, and the rest of the people will remain unredeemed. According to him, this ″apparently arrogant assumption″ is closely related and other characteristics of various gurus. Storr applies the term \"guru\" to figures as diverse as Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Gurdjieff, Rudolf Steiner, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Jim Jones and David Koresh. \nRob Preece, a psychotherapist and a practicing Buddhist, writes in The Noble Imperfection that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards. He writes that these potential hazards are the result of naiveté amongst Westerners as to the nature of the guru/devotee relationship, as well as a consequence of a lack of understanding on the part of Eastern teachers as to the nature of Western psychology. Preece introduces the notion of transference to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes: \"In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves.\" In developing this concept, Preece writes that, when we transfer an inner quality onto another person, we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger: \"In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist, while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the archetype\".\nThe psychiatrist Alexander Deutsch performed a long-term observation of a small cult, called The Family (not to be confused with Family International), founded by an American guru called Baba or Jeff in New York in 1972, who showed increasingly schizophrenic behavior. Deutsch observed that this man's mostly Jewish followers interpreted the guru's pathological mood swings as expressions of different Hindu deities and interpreted his behavior as holy madness, and his cruel deeds as punishments that they had earned. After the guru dissolved the cult in 1976, his mental condition was confirmed by Jeff's retrospective accounts to an author.\nJan van der Lans (1933–2002), a professor of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, the distinction between the person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical personality cult.\nIn their 1993 book, The Guru Papers, authors Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer reject the guru-disciple tradition because of what they see as its structural defects. These defects include the authoritarian control of the guru over the disciple, which is in their view increased by the guru's encouragement of surrender to him. Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus are likely to be hypocrites because, in order to attract and maintain followers, gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus.\nAccording to the journalist Sacha Kester, in a 2003 article in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, finding a guru is a precarious matter, pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of Sathya Sai Baba whom Kester considers a swindler. In this article he also quotes the book Karma Cola describing that in this book a German economist tells author Gita Mehta, \"It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. Many of my friends have become crazy in India\". She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners do not believe in spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.\n\nSee also\nBibliography\nAmanda Lucia (2022), The contemporary guru field.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOL",
        "content": "LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laughing out loud, and a popular element of Internet slang, which can be used to indicate amusement, irony, or double meanings. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO (\"laughing my ass off\") and ROFL or ROTFL (\"rolling on the floor laughing\").\nIn 2003, the list of acronyms was said to \"grow by the month\", and they were collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication. These initialisms are controversial, and several authors recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications. The Oxford English Dictionary first listed LOL in March 2011.\n\nHistory\nIn the early to mid-1980s, Wayne Pearson was reportedly the first person to have used LOL while responding to a friend's joke in a pre-Internet digital chat room called Viewline. Instead of writing \"hahaha,\" as he had done before when he found something humorous, Pearson stated that he instead typed \"LOL\" to symbolize extreme laughter. Although the account is commonly accepted as true, no written record of the conversation has been found, and the exact date of origin is unknown.: 82–83  The earliest recorded mention of LOL in the contemporary meaning of \"Laughing Out Loud\" was made in a list of common online acronyms on the May 8, 1989 issue of the electronic newsletter FidoNews, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and linguist Ben Zimmer.: 83 \n\nA 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students \"used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons\". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of LOL.On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary. In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for \"little old lady\" in the 1960s.\nGabriella Coleman references \"lulz\" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.\nLOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal – likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century – states that this is \"a brand new variety of language evolving\", invented by young people within five years, that \"extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language\". However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their \"total effect on language\" would be \"utterly trivial\".\nWhile LOL originally meant \"laughing out loud,\" modern usage is different, and it is commonly used for irony, as an indicator of second meanings, and as a way to soften statements.\n\nAnalysis\nSilvio Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Scott Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, \"Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms.\" Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that smileys and abbreviations are \"no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication\".\nLinguist John McWhorter stated, \"Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles...\" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as oh in \"Oh, I don't know\" and uh when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that lol is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.\nFrank Yunker and Stephen Barry, in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting, have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are \"often misunderstood\" by students and are \"difficult to decipher\" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of \"ROFL\" as not obviously being the abbreviation of \"rolling on the floor laughing\" (emphasis added). Matt Haig describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that \"as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing\". Hossein Bidgoli advises that such initialisms should be used \"only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning\" as they \"might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver\", and differences in meaning may lead to misunderstandings in international contexts.\nTim Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of \"annotating text with stage directions\". Peter Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: \"The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.\"\nDavid Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question \"How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?\". Louis Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.\nVictoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that \"a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol\", and opines that \"these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse\". Michael Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, \"or you won't be LOL\".\n\nVariations on the theme\nVariants\nlul: phonetic spelling of LOL. \"LUL\" is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote on Twitch, which depicts game critic TotalBiscuit laughing.\nlolz: Occasionally used in place of LOL.\nlulz: Often used to denote laughter at someone who is the victim of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a New York Times article about Internet trolling, \"lulz means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium.\" Can be used as a noun – e.g. \"do it for the lulz.\", shortened into \"ftlulz\" (to distinguish it from \"ftl\" – \"for the loss\"). See also LulzSec.\nLOLOLOL...: For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of \"OL\". In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., \"Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud\"), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row.\nOMEGALUL and LULW: variants of \"LUL\" used as a Twitch emote.\ntrolololol or trollololol: A blend of troll and LOL iterated, likely meant to mimick Eduard Khil's 1976 song Mr. Trololo song, which became an internet meme in 2010. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as internet trolling.\n\nDerivations\n(to) LOL: Used as a verb (\"to laugh out loud\") and is meant to be conjugated in the appropriate tense. When the past tense is meant, it is written as \"LOL(e)d\" or \"LOL'd\".\nlolwut (sometimes \"lulwut\"): lol + wut, used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion.\nlawl, lawlz, or lal: Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying \"lawl\" is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL and is not meant to express laughter.\nLel or LEL is a \"playful or ironic\" variation of LOL. It is sometimes thought to be an initialism, standing for \"laughing extremely loud\" or \"laughing extra loud\", but this has been disputed.\nlolcat, an image macro of a cat\n\nRelated\n*G* or *g*: For \"grins\". Like \"lulz\" it is used in the initialism \"J4G\" (\"just for grins\").\nkek: A term for laughter that originated in online games, possibly either World of Warcraft or StarCraft, the latter in which Korean players would type \"kekeke\" as onomatopoeia for laughter. It later became associated with alt-right politics, in the form of a parody religion surrounding the character Pepe the Frog by analogy with the frog-headed ancient Egyptian god Kek.\nLMAO: For \"laughing my arse/ass off\". Variants: LMBO (\"Laughing my butt off\"), LMFAO (\"Laughing my fucking ass off\").\nlqtm: For \"Laughing quietly to myself\".\nROFL: For \"rolling on the floor laughing\". It is often combined with LMAO for added emphasis as ROFLMAO (\"Rolling on the floor laughing my ass off\") or ROFLMFAO (Rolling on the floor laughing my fucking ass off).\nroflcopter: A portmanteau of ROFL and helicopter. A popular glitch in the Microsoft Sam text-to-speech engine enables the voice to make a sound akin to the rotation of rotor blades when 'SOI' or 'SOY' is entered, and the phrase 'My ROFLcopter goes soi soi soi...\" is often associated with the term as a result.\nPMSL: For \"pissing myself laughing\".\nIJBOL: For \"I just burst out laughing\". Gaining popularity among Gen Z, initially popularized within the K-pop fandom. Not derived from Korean.\nXD, sometimes stylized as xD, xd, or Xd, is an emoticon commonly used to symbolize extreme laughter or happiness.\n\nCommonly used equivalents in other languages\nPre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is \"hi hi\". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.\n\n555: the Thai variation of LOL. \"5\" in Thai is pronounced \"ha\", three of them being \"hahaha\" (ห้า ห้า ห้า).\nasg: Swedish abbreviation of the term asgarv, meaning intense laughter.\ng: Danish abbreviation of the word griner, which means \"laughing\" in Danish.\njajajá: in Spanish, the letter \"j\" is pronounced /x/.\njejeje: in the Philippines is used to represent \"hehehe\". \"j\" in Filipino languages is pronounced as /h/, derived from the Spanish /x/. Its origins can be traced to SMS language. It is widely used in a Filipino youth subculture known as Jejemons.\nmdr: Esperanto version, from the initials of multe da ridoj, which translates to \"lot of laughs\" in English.\nmdr: French version, from the initials of \"mort de rire\" which roughly translated means \"died of laughter\", although many French people also use LOL instead as it is the most widely used on the internet.\nmkm: in Afghanistan \"mkm\" (being an abbreviation of the phrase \"ma khanda mikonom\"). This is a Dari phrase that means \"I am laughing\".\nptdr: French variant from pété de rire – literally meaning \"broken with laughter\"\nrs: in Brazil \"rs\" (being an abbreviation of \"risos\", the plural of \"laugh\") is often used in text based communications in situations where in English LOL would be used, repeating it (\"rsrsrsrsrs\") is often done to express longer laughter or laughing harder. Also popular is \"kkk\" (which can also be repeated indefinitely), due to the pronunciation of the letter k in Brazilian Portuguese sounding similar to the ca in card, and therefore representing the laugh \"cacacacaca\" (also similar to the Hebrew version below).\nחחח/ההה: Hebrew version of LOL. The letter ח is pronounced [/x/ /x/] and ה is pronounced [/h/ /h/]. Putting them together (usually three or more in a row) makes the word khakhakha or hahaha (since vowels in Hebrew are generally not written), which is in many languages regarded as the sound of laughter.\nㅋㅋㅋ (\"kkk\" or \"kekeke\") and ㅎㅎㅎ (\"hhh\") are usually used to indicate laughter in Korean. 'ㅋ', is a Korean Jamo consonant representing a \"k\" sound, and 'ㅎ' represents an \"h\" sound. Both \"ㅋㅋㅋ\" and \"ㅎㅎㅎ\" represent laughter which is not very loud. However, if a vowel symbol is written, louder laughter is implied: 하하 \"haha\" 호호, \"hoho.\"\n(笑): in Japanese, the kanji for laugh, is used in the same way as lol. It can be read as kakko warai (literally \"parentheses laugh\") or just wara. w is also used as an abbreviation, and it is common for multiple w to be chained together. The resulting shape formed from multiple wwwww leads to the usage of 草 ( 草 meaning grass, read as kusa), due to its resemblance to the shape of grass.\n\nSee also\nFace with Tears of Joy emoji (😂)\nInternet meme\nLeet\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nConnery, Brian A.

        "content": "Apathy, also referred to as indifference, is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, or concern about something. It is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, or passion. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, virtual, or physical life and the world. Apathy can also be defined as a person's lack of goal orientation. Apathy falls in the less extreme spectrum of diminished motivation, with abulia in the middle and akinetic mutism being more extreme than both apathy and abulia.\nThe apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or meaning in their life. People with severe apathy tend to have a lower quality of life and are at a higher risk for mortality and early institutionalization. They may also exhibit insensibility or sluggishness. In positive psychology, apathy is described as a result of the individuals' feeling they do not possess the level of skill required to confront a challenge (i.e. \"flow\"). It may also be a result of perceiving no challenge at all (e.g., the challenge is irrelevant to them, or conversely, they have learned helplessness). Apathy is usually felt only in the short term, but sometimes it becomes a long-term or even lifelong state, often leading to deeper social and psychological issues.\nApathy should be distinguished from reduced affect display, which refers to reduced emotional expression but not necessarily reduced emotion.\nPathological apathy, characterized by extreme forms of apathy, is now known to occur in many different brain disorders, including neurodegenerative conditions often associated with dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Although many patients with pathological apathy also have depression, several studies have shown that the two syndromes are dissociable: apathy can occur independent of depression and vice versa.\n\nEtymology\nAlthough the word apathy was first used in 1594 and is derived from the Greek ἀπάθεια (apatheia), from ἀπάθης (apathēs, \"without feeling\" from a- (\"without, not\") and pathos (\"emotion\")), it is important not to confuse the two terms.  Also meaning \"absence of passion,\" \"apathy\" or \"insensibility\" in Greek, the term apatheia was used by the Stoics to signify a (desirable) state of indifference toward events and things that lie outside one's control (that is, according to their philosophy, all things exterior, one being only responsible for one's own representations and judgments). In contrast to apathy, apatheia is considered a virtue, especially in Orthodox monasticism.  In the Philokalia the word dispassion is used for apatheia, so as not to confuse it with apathy.\n\nHistory and other views\nChristians have historically condemned apathy as a deficiency of love and devotion to God and his works. This interpretation of apathy is also referred to as Sloth and is listed among the Seven Deadly Sins. Clemens Alexandrinus used the term to draw to gnostic Christianity philosophers who aspired after virtue.\nThe modern concept of apathy became more well known after World War I, when it was one of the various forms of \"shell shock\", now better known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Soldiers who lived in the trenches amidst the bombing and machine gun fire, and who saw the battlefields strewn with dead and maimed comrades, developed a sense of disconnected numbness and indifference to normal social interaction when they returned from combat.\nIn 1950, US novelist John Dos Passos wrote: \"Apathy is one of the characteristic responses of any living organism when it is subjected to stimuli too intense or too complicated to cope with. The cure for apathy is comprehension.\"\n\nSocial origin\nThere may be other factors contributing to a person's apathy.\nApathy has been socially viewed as worse than things such as hate or anger.  Not caring whatsoever, in the eyes of some, is even worse than having distaste for something.  Author Leo Buscaglia is quoted as saying \"I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate-it's apathy.  It's not giving a damn.\" Helen Keller stated that apathy is the \"worst of them all\" when it comes to the various evils in the world. French social commentator and political thinker Charles de Montesquieu stated that \"the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in the democracy.\" As can be seen by these quotes and various others, the social implications of apathy are great.  Many people believe that not caring at all can be worse for society than individuals who are overpowering or hateful.\n\nIn the school system\nApathy in students, especially those in high school, is a growing problem. It causes teachers to lower standards in order to try to engage their  students. Apathy in schools is most easily recognized by students being unmotivated or, quite commonly, being motivated by outside factors. For example, when asked about their motivation for doing well in school, fifty percent of students cited outside sources such as \"college acceptance\" or \"good grades\". On the contrary, only fourteen percent cited \"gaining an understanding of content knowledge or learning subject material\" as their motivation to do well in school. As a result of these outside sources, and not a genuine desire for knowledge, students often do the minimum amount of work necessary to get by in their classes. This then leads to average grades and test grades but no real grasping of knowledge. Many students cited that \"assignments/content was irrelevant or meaningless\" and that this was the cause of their apathetic attitudes toward their schooling, leading to teacher and parent frustration. Other causes of apathy in students include situations within their home life, media influences, peer influences, school struggles and failures. Some of the signs of apathetic students include declining grades, skipping classes, routine illness, and behavioral changes both in school and at home. In order to combat this, teachers have to be aware that students have different motivation profiles; i.e. they are motivated by different factors or stimuli.\n\nBystander\nAlso known as the bystander effect, bystander apathy occurs when, during an emergency, those standing by do nothing to help but instead stand by and watch.  Sometimes this can be caused by one bystander observing other bystanders and imitating their behavior. If other people are not acting in a way that makes the situation seem like an emergency that needs attention, often other bystanders will act in the same way. The diffusion to responsibility can also be to blame for bystander apathy.  The more people that are around in emergency situations, the more likely individuals are to think that someone else will help so they do not need to. This theory was popularized by social psychologists in response to the 1964 Kitty Genovese murder. The murder took place in New York and the victim, Genovese, was stabbed to death as bystanders reportedly stood by and did nothing to stop the situation or even call the police. Latané and Darley are the two psychologists who did research on this theory.  They performed different experiments that placed people into situations where they had the opportunity to intervene or do nothing. The individuals in the experiment were either by themselves, with a stranger(s), with a friend, or with a confederate. The experiments ultimately led them to the conclusion that there are many social and situational factors that are behind whether a person will react in an emergency situation or simply remain apathetic to what is occurring.\n\nMeasurement\nSeveral different questionnaires and clinical interview instruments have been used to measure pathological apathy or, more recently, apathy in healthy people.\n\nApathy Evaluation Scale\nDeveloped by Robert Marin in 1991, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) was the first method developed to measure apathy in clinical populations. Centered around evaluation, the scale can either be self-informed or other-informed. The three versions of the test include self, informant such as a family member, and clinician. The scale is based around questionnaires that ask about topics including interest, motivation, socialization, and how the individual spends their time. The individual or informant answers on a scale of \"not at all\", \"slightly\", \"somewhat\" or \"a lot\". Each item on the evaluation is created with positive or negative syntax and deals with cognition, behavior, and emotion.  Each item is then scored and, based on the score, the individual's level of apathy can be evaluated.\n\nApathy Motivation Index\nThe Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) was developed to measure different dimensions of apathy in healthy people. Factor analysis identified three distinct axes of apathy: behavioural, social and emotional. The AMI has since been used to examine apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease who, overall, showed evidence of behavioural and social apathy, but not emotional apathy. Patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, subjective cognitive impairment and limbic encephalitis have also been assessed using the AMI, and their self-reports of apathy were compared with those of caregivers using the AMI caregiver scale.\n\nDimensional Apathy Scale\nThe Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is a multidimensional apathy instrument for measuring subtypes of apathy in different clinical populations and healthy adults. It was developed using factor analysis, quantifying Executive apathy (lack of motivation for planning, organising and attention), Emotional apathy (emotional indifference, neutrality, flatness or blunting) and Initiation apathy (lack of motivation for self-generation of thought/action). There is a self-rated version of the DAS and an informant/carer-rated version of the DAS. Further a clinical brief DAS has also been developed. It has been validated for use in stroke, Huntington's disease, motor neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, showing to differentiate profiles of apathy subtypes between these conditions.\n\nMedical aspects\nDepression\nMental health journalist and author John McManamy argues that although psychiatrists do not explicitly deal with the condition of apathy, it is a psychological problem for some depressed people, in which they get a sense that \"nothing matters\", the \"lack of will to go on and the inability to care about the consequences\". He describes depressed people who \"...cannot seem to make [themselves] do anything\", who \"can't complete anything\", and who do not \"feel any excitement about seeing loved ones\". He acknowledges that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not discuss apathy.\nIn a Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences article from 1991, Robert Marin, MD, claimed that pathological apathy occurs due to brain damage or neuropsychiatric illnesses such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, or stroke. Marin argues that apathy is a syndrome associated with many different brain disorders. This has now been shown to be the case across a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions.\nA review article by Robert van Reekum, MD, et al. from the University of Toronto in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry (2005) claimed that an obvious relationship between depression and apathy exists in some populations. However, although many patients with depression also have apathy, several studies have shown that apathy can occur independently of depression, and vice versa.\nApathy can be associated with depression, a manifestation of negative disorders in schizophrenia, or a symptom of various somatic and neurological disorders. Sometimes apathy and depression are viewed as the same thing, but actually take different forms depending on someone's mental condition.\n\nAlzheimer's disease\nDepending upon how it has been measured, apathy affects 19–88% percent of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (mean prevalence of 49% across different studies). It is a neuropsychiatric symptom associated with functional impairment. Brain imaging studies have demonstrated changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in Alzheimer's patients with apathy. Cholinesterase inhibitors, used as the first line of treatment for the cognitive symptoms associated with dementia, have also shown some modest benefit for behavior disturbances such as apathy. The effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine have all been assessed but, overall, the findings have been inconsistent, and it is estimated that apathy in ~60% of Alzheimer's patients does not respond to treatment with these drugs. Methylphenidate, a dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake blocker, has received increasing interest for the treatment of apathy. Management of apathetic symptoms using methylphenidate has shown promise in randomized placebo controlled trials of Alzheimer's patients. A phase III multi-centered randomized placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy has reported positive effects.\n\nParkinson's disease\nOverall, ~40% of Parkinson's disease patients suffer from apathy, with prevalence rates varying from 16 to 62%, depending on the study. Apathy is increasingly recognized to be an important non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease. It has a significant negative impact on quality of life. In some patients, apathy can be improved by dopaminergic medication. There is also some evidence for a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors such as Rivastigmine on apathy. Diminished sensitivity to reward may be a key component of the syndrome in Parkinson's disease.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia\nPathological apathy is considered to be one of the diagnostic features of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, occurring in the majority of people with this condition. Both hypersensitivity to effort as well as blunting of sensitivity to reward may be components of behavioural apathy in frontotemporal dementia.\n\nAnxiety\nWhile apathy and anxiety may appear to be separate, and different, states of being, there are many ways that severe anxiety can cause apathy.  First, the emotional fatigue that so often accompanies severe anxiety leads to one's emotions being worn out, thus leading to apathy.  Second, the low serotonin levels associated with anxiety often lead to less passion and interest in the activities in one's life, which can be seen as apathy.  Third, negative thinking and distractions associated with anxiety can ultimately lead to a decrease in one's overall happiness which can then lead to an apathetic outlook about one's life.  Finally, the difficulty enjoying activities that individuals with anxiety often face can lead to them doing these activities much less often and can give them a sense of apathy about their lives.  Even behavioral apathy may be found in individuals with anxiety in the form of them not wanting to make efforts to treat their anxiety.\n\nOther\nOften, apathy is felt after witnessing horrific acts, such as the killing or maiming of people during a war, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. It is also known to be a distinct psychiatric syndrome that is associated with many conditions, more prominently recognized in the elderly, some of which are: CADASIL syndrome, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Chagas disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, dementia (and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia), Korsakoff's syndrome, excessive vitamin D, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, general fatigue, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), brain damage, schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, and others. Some medications and the heavy use of drugs such as opiates may bring apathy as a side effect.\n\nSee also\nAcedia\nCallous and unemotional traits\nCompassion fatigue\nDetachment (philosophy)\nPolitical apathy\nReduced affect display\n\nNotes\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chambers, Ephraim, ed.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt",
        "content": "A stunt is an unusual, difficult, dramatic physical feat that may require a special skill, performed for artistic purposes usually for a public audience, as on television or in theaters or cinema. Stunts are a feature of many action films. Before computer-generated imagery special effects, these depictions were limited to the use of models, false perspective and other in-camera effects, unless the creator could find someone willing to carry them out, even such dangerous acts as jumping from car to car in motion or hanging from the edge of a skyscraper: the stunt performer or stunt double.\n\nTypes of stunt effects\nPractical effects\nOne of the most-frequently used practical stunts is stage combat. Although contact is normally avoided, many elements of stage combat, such as sword fighting, martial arts, and acrobatics required contact between performers in order to facilitate the creation of a particular effect, such as noise or physical interaction. Stunt performances are highly choreographed and may be rigorously rehearsed for hours, days and sometimes weeks before a performance. Seasoned professionals will commonly treat a performance as if they have never done it before, since the risks in stunt work are high, every move and position must be correct to reduce risk of injury from accidents. Examples of practical effects include tripping and falling down, high jumps, extreme sporting moves, acrobatics and high diving, spins, gainer falls, \"suicide backflips,\" and other martial arts stunts. Stunt airbags (or \"stunt mats\"), large deep airbags that may be the size of a small swimming pool, are typically used by professional stunt performers to cushion their landings from staged falls from heights.\n\nMechanical effects\nA physical stunt is usually performed with help of mechanics. For example, if the plot requires the hero to jump to a high place, the film crew could put the actor in a special harness, and use aircraft high tension wire to pull them up. Piano wire is sometimes used to fly objects, but an actor is never suspended from it as it is brittle and can break under shock impacts. Hero (2003) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) are examples of wuxia films that use kung-fu and are heavily reliant on wire stunts. The Matrix is an example of extensive wire and rigging work in Western cinema.\n\nVehicular stunts\nPerformers of vehicular stunts require extensive training and may employ specially adapted vehicles. Stunts can be as simple as a handbrake turn, also known as the bootleg turn, or as advanced as car chases, jumps and crashes involving dozens of vehicles. Rémy Julienne is a well known pioneering automotive stunt performer and coordinator.  A Guinness Book of World Records holder stunt driver, Bobby Ore, performed in numerous movies and events and holds a world record for longest distance driven on two wheels in a London double decker bus (810 feet).\n\nAviation stunts go back to those performed in balloons in the 18th century. After the advent of powered aircraft in 1903, barnstorming and aerobatics came into existence. Ormer Locklear invented or helped develop many of the basic tricks of stunt flying, which included wing walking and transferring between airplanes in mid-air. Hollywood and the public's fascination with aviation made great demands on stunt pilots, resulting in many injuries and fatalities.\n\nComputer-generated effects\nIn the late 20th century stunt men were often placed in dangerous situations less and less as filmmakers turned to relatively inexpensive (and much safer) computer graphics effects using harnesses, fans, blue- or green screens, and a huge array of other devices and digital effects. The Matrix (1999) is an example of a film that extensively enhanced real stunts through CGI post production. The Lord of the Rings film series and the Star Wars prequel films often display stunts that are entirely computer generated. Examples of computer-generated effects include face replacement and wire removal.\n\nHong Kong action cinema\nIn 1982, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in Dragon Lord, which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. In 1983, Project A saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies).\nPolice Story (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase through a shanty town, Chan stopping a double-decker bus with his service revolver and a climactic fight scene in a shopping mall. This final scene earned the film the nickname \"Glass Story\" by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of sugar glass that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering second-degree burns, particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing. Chan performed similarly elaborate stunts in numerous other films, such as several Police Story sequels, Project A Part II, the Armor of God series, Dragons Forever, Drunken Master II, and Rumble in the Bronx among others.\n\n \nOther Hong Kong action movie stars who became known for performing elaborate stunts include Chan's Peking Opera School friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, as well as \"girls with guns\" stars such as Michelle Yeoh and Moon Lee. Other Asian cinema stars also known for performing elaborate stunts include Thai actor Tony Jaa; Indonesian actors Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian; and Indian actors Jayan, Akshay Kumar, Vidyut Jammwal and Tiger Shroff.\n\nStunts that have gone wrong\nRecognition of stunt performers\nFilms such as Hooper and The Stunt Man and the 1980s television show The Fall Guy sought to raise the profile of the stunt performer and debunk the myth that film stars perform all their own stunts. Noted stunt coordinators Hal Needham, Craig R. Baxley, and Vic Armstrong went on to direct the action films The Cannonball Run, Action Jackson, and Joshua Tree. Vic Armstrong became the first stuntman to win both an Academy Award (for developing a descender rig as a safe alternative to airbags) and a BAFTA award (for lifetime achievement in film). But the status of stuntmen in Hollywood is still low; despite the fact that few films of any genre or type could be made without them, stunt performers are still perceived as working mainly in action films. Repeated campaigns for a \"Best Stunts\" Academy Award have been rejected.\nIn 2001, the first \"World Stunt Awards\" were presented in Los Angeles by actor Alec Baldwin. The event had A-list stars presenting the statues to Hollywood's stunt performers. Arnold Schwarzenegger was presented with the first \"Lifetime Achievement\" award. He presented the awards in 2001. The awards show hands out eight awards: Best Fight, Best Fire Stunt, Best High Work, Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Man, Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Woman, Best Speciality Stunt, Best Work with a Vehicle and Best Stunt Coordinator or 2nd Unit Director.\n\nEquality in stunts\nIn past Hollywood films it was common for men to double for women and white American stunt performers to double for African American performers, in a practice known as \"wigging\". Veteran stunt man Dave Sharpe, a man of shorter than average height, often doubled for women in film serials of the 1930s and '40s. Veteran stunt performer Jeannie Epper, who doubled for Lynda Carter in Wonder Woman, explained that the situation improved in the 1970s as actresses did not want to be doubled by men, and could be more convincingly doubled by a woman. SAG-AFTRA union rules for stunt performers say that to double an actor of a different gender or race the stunt must be so dangerous that there are no volunteers available of the appropriate gender or race. For example, in A View to a Kill, stuntman B.J. Worth doubled for the black Jamaican actress Grace Jones whose character parachuted off the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe future of stunt work\nA backlash against dangerous stunts followed the fatal 42-foot backward fall of Sonja Davis off a building on the set of Vampire in Brooklyn. Despite speculation that developments in computer-generated imagery (CGI) would make stunts unnecessary and reduce stunt performers to the status of body doubles, stunt work has increasingly been made safer and enhanced by CGI effects; nevertheless, stunt performers remain essential to provide a human quality to the action.\n\nSee also\nStunt coordinator\nStunt performer\nStunt double\nMotorcycle stunt riding\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nGene Scott Freese, 2014, Hollywood Stunt Performers, 1910s-1970s: A Biographical Dictionary, 2nd ed. illustr. rev., McFarland, ISBN 0786476435, see [1], accessed 16 April 2015.\n\nExternal links\nTaurus World Stunt Awards\nPhotos from competition and international gathering stuntriders in Minsk (Belarus)",

        "content": "In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that prevents state from being modified or accessed by multiple threads of execution at once. Locks enforce mutual exclusion concurrency control policies, and with a variety of possible methods there exist multiple unique implementations for different applications.\n\nTypes\nGenerally, locks are advisory locks, where each thread cooperates by acquiring the lock before accessing the corresponding data. Some systems also implement mandatory locks, where attempting unauthorized access to a locked resource will force an exception in the entity attempting to make the access.\nThe simplest type of lock is a binary semaphore. It provides exclusive access to the locked data. Other schemes also provide shared access for reading data. Other widely implemented access modes are exclusive, intend-to-exclude and intend-to-upgrade.\nAnother way to classify locks is by what happens when the lock strategy prevents the progress of a thread. Most locking designs block the execution of the thread requesting the lock until it is allowed to access the locked resource. With a spinlock, the thread simply waits (\"spins\") until the lock becomes available. This is efficient if threads are blocked for a short time, because it avoids the overhead of operating system process re-scheduling. It is inefficient if the lock is held for a long time, or if the progress of the thread that is holding the lock depends on preemption of the locked thread.\nLocks typically require hardware support for efficient implementation. This support usually takes the form of one or more atomic instructions such as \"test-and-set\", \"fetch-and-add\" or \"compare-and-swap\". These instructions allow a single process to test if the lock is free, and if free, acquire the lock in a single atomic operation.\nUniprocessor architectures have the option of using uninterruptible sequences of instructions—using special instructions or instruction prefixes to disable interrupts temporarily—but this technique does not work for multiprocessor shared-memory machines. Proper support for locks in a multiprocessor environment can require quite complex hardware or software support, with substantial synchronization issues.\nThe reason an atomic operation is required is because of concurrency, where more than one task executes the same logic. For example, consider the following C code:\n\nThe above example does not guarantee that the task has the lock, since more than one task can be testing the lock at the same time. Since both tasks will detect that the lock is free, both tasks will attempt to set the lock, not knowing that the other task is also setting the lock. Dekker's or Peterson's algorithm are possible substitutes if atomic locking operations are not available.\nCareless use of locks can result in deadlock or livelock. A number of strategies can be used to avoid or recover from deadlocks or livelocks, both at design-time and at run-time. (The most common strategy is to standardize the lock acquisition sequences so that combinations of inter-dependent locks are always acquired in a specifically defined \"cascade\" order.)\nSome languages do support locks syntactically. An example in C# follows:\n\nC# introduced System.Threading.Lock in C# 13 on .NET 9.\nThe code lock(this) can lead to problems if the instance can be accessed publicly.\nSimilar to Java, C# can also synchronize entire methods, by using the MethodImplOptions.Synchronized attribute.\n\nGranularity\nBefore being introduced to lock granularity, one needs to understand three concepts about locks:\n\nlock overhead: the extra resources for using locks, like the memory space allocated for locks, the CPU time to initialize and destroy locks, and the time for acquiring or releasing locks. The more locks a program uses, the more overhead associated with the usage;\nlock contention: this occurs whenever one process or thread attempts to acquire a lock held by another process or thread. The more fine-grained the available locks, the less likely one process/thread will request a lock held by the other. (For example, locking a row rather than the entire table, or locking a cell rather than the entire row);\ndeadlock: the situation when each of at least two tasks is waiting for a lock that the other task holds. Unless something is done, the two tasks will wait forever.\nThere is a tradeoff between decreasing lock overhead and decreasing lock contention when choosing the number of locks in synchronization.\nAn important property of a lock is its granularity. The granularity is a measure of the amount of data the lock is protecting. In general, choosing a coarse granularity (a small number of locks, each protecting a large segment of data) results in less lock overhead when a single process is accessing the protected data, but worse performance when multiple processes are running concurrently. This is because of increased lock contention. The more coarse the lock, the higher the likelihood that the lock will stop an unrelated process from proceeding. Conversely, using a fine granularity (a larger number of locks, each protecting a fairly small amount of data) increases the overhead of the locks themselves but reduces lock contention. Granular locking where each process must hold multiple locks from a common set of locks can create subtle lock dependencies. This subtlety can increase the chance that a programmer will unknowingly introduce a deadlock.\nIn a database management system, for example, a lock could protect, in order of decreasing granularity, part of a field, a field, a record, a data page, or an entire table. Coarse granularity, such as using table locks, tends to give the best performance for a single user, whereas fine granularity, such as record locks, tends to give the best performance for multiple users.\n\nDatabase locks\nDatabase locks can be used as a means of ensuring transaction synchronicity. i.e. when making transaction processing concurrent (interleaving transactions), using 2-phased locks ensures that the concurrent execution of the transaction turns out equivalent to some serial ordering of the transaction. However, deadlocks become an unfortunate side-effect of locking in databases. Deadlocks are either prevented by pre-determining the locking order between transactions or are detected using waits-for graphs. An alternate to locking for database synchronicity while avoiding deadlocks involves the use of totally ordered global timestamps.\nThere are mechanisms employed to manage the actions of multiple concurrent users on a database—the purpose is to prevent lost updates and dirty reads. The two types of locking are pessimistic locking and optimistic locking:\n\nPessimistic locking: a user who reads a record with the intention of updating it places an exclusive lock on the record to prevent other users from manipulating it. This means no one else can manipulate that record until the user releases the lock. The downside is that users can be locked out for a very long time, thereby slowing the overall system response and causing frustration.\nWhere to use pessimistic locking: this is mainly used in environments where data-contention (the degree of users request to the database system at any one time) is heavy; where the cost of protecting data through locks is less than the cost of rolling back transactions, if concurrency conflicts occur. Pessimistic concurrency is best implemented when lock times will be short, as in programmatic processing of records. Pessimistic concurrency requires a persistent connection to the database and is not a scalable option when users are interacting with data, because records might be locked for relatively large periods of time. It is not appropriate for use in Web application development.\nOptimistic locking: this allows multiple concurrent users access to the database whilst the system keeps a copy of the initial-read made by each user. When a user wants to update a record, the application determines whether another user has changed the record since it was last read. The application does this by comparing the initial-read held in memory to the database record to verify any changes made to the record. Any discrepancies between the initial-read and the database record violates concurrency rules and hence causes the system to disregard any update request. An error message is generated and the user is asked to start the update process again. It improves database performance by reducing the amount of locking required, thereby reducing the load on the database server. It works efficiently with tables that require limited updates since no users are locked out. However, some updates may fail. The downside is constant update failures due to high volumes of update requests from multiple concurrent users - it can be frustrating for users.\nWhere to use optimistic locking: this is appropriate in environments where there is low contention for data, or where read-only access to data is required. Optimistic concurrency is used extensively in .NET to address the needs of mobile and disconnected applications, where locking data rows for prolonged periods of time would be infeasible. Also, maintaining record locks requires a persistent connection to the database server, which is not possible in disconnected applications.\n\nLock compatibility table\nSeveral variations and refinements of these major lock types exist, with respective variations of blocking behavior. If a first lock blocks another lock, the two locks are called incompatible; otherwise the locks are compatible. Often, lock types blocking interactions are presented in the technical literature by a Lock compatibility table. The following is an example with the common, major lock types:\n\n✔ indicates compatibility\nX indicates incompatibility, i.e, a case when a lock of the first type (in left column) on an object blocks a lock of the second type (in top row) from being acquired on the same object (by another transaction). An object typically has a queue of waiting requested (by transactions) operations with respective locks. The first blocked lock for operation in the queue is acquired as soon as the existing blocking lock is removed from the object, and then its respective operation is executed. If a lock for operation in the queue is not blocked by any existing lock (existence of multiple compatible locks on a same object is possible concurrently), it is acquired immediately.\nComment: In some publications, the table entries are simply marked \"compatible\" or \"incompatible\", or respectively \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nDisadvantages\nLock-based resource protection and thread/process synchronization have many disadvantages:\n\nContention: some threads/processes have to wait until a lock (or a whole set of locks) is released. If one of the threads holding a lock dies, stalls, blocks, or enters an infinite loop, other threads waiting for the lock may wait indefinitely until the computer is power cycled.\nOverhead: the use of locks adds overhead for each access to a resource, even when the chances for collision are very rare. (However, any chance for such collisions is a race condition.)\nDebugging: bugs associated with locks are time dependent and can be very subtle and extremely hard to replicate, such as deadlocks.\nInstability: the optimal balance between lock overhead and lock contention can be unique to the problem domain (application) and sensitive to design, implementation, and even low-level system architectural changes. These balances may change over the life cycle of an application and may entail tremendous changes to update (re-balance).\nComposability: locks are only composable (e.g., managing multiple concurrent locks in order to atomically delete item X from table A and insert X into table B) with relatively elaborate (overhead) software support and perfect adherence by applications programming to rigorous conventions.\nPriority inversion: a low-priority thread/process holding a common lock can prevent high-priority threads/processes from proceeding. Priority inheritance can be used to reduce priority-inversion duration. The priority ceiling protocol can be used on uniprocessor systems to minimize the worst-case priority-inversion duration, as well as prevent deadlock.\nConvoying: all other threads have to wait if a thread holding a lock is descheduled due to a time-slice interrupt or page fault.\nSome concurrency control strategies avoid some or all of these problems. For example, a funnel or serializing tokens can avoid the biggest problem: deadlocks. Alternatives to locking include non-blocking synchronization methods, like lock-free programming techniques and transactional memory. However, such alternative methods often require that the actual lock mechanisms be implemented at a more fundamental level of the operating software. Therefore, they may only relieve the application level from the details of implementing locks, with the problems listed above still needing to be dealt with beneath the application.\nIn most cases, proper locking depends on the CPU providing a method of atomic instruction stream synchronization (for example, the addition or deletion of an item into a pipeline requires that all contemporaneous operations needing to add or delete other items in the pipe be suspended during the manipulation of the memory content required to add or delete the specific item). Therefore, an application can often be more robust when it recognizes the burdens it places upon an operating system and is capable of graciously recognizing the reporting of impossible demands.\n\nLack of composability\nOne of lock-based programming's biggest problems is that \"locks don't compose\": it is hard to combine small, correct lock-based modules into equally correct larger programs without modifying the modules or at least knowing about their internals. Simon Peyton Jones (an advocate of software transactional memory) gives the following example of a banking application: design a class Account that allows multiple concurrent clients to deposit or withdraw money to an account, and give an algorithm to transfer money from one account to another.\nThe lock-based solution to the first part of the problem is:\n\nclass Account:\n    member balance: Integer\n    member mutex: Lock\n\n    method deposit(n: Integer)\n           mutex.lock()\n           balance ← balance + n\n           mutex.unlock()\n\n    method withdraw(n: Integer)\n           deposit(−n)\n\nThe second part of the problem is much more complicated. A transfer routine that is correct for sequential programs would be\n\nfunction transfer(from: Account, to: Account, amount: Integer)\n    from.withdraw(amount)\n    to.deposit(amount)\n\nIn a concurrent program, this algorithm is incorrect because when one thread is halfway through transfer, another might observe a state where amount has been withdrawn from the first account, but not yet deposited into the other account: money has gone missing from the system. This problem can only be fixed completely by putting locks on both accounts prior to changing either one, but then the locks have to be placed according to some arbitrary, global ordering to prevent deadlock:\n\nfunction transfer(from: Account, to: Account, amount: Integer)\n    if from < to    // arbitrary ordering on the locks\n        from.lock()\n        to.lock()\n    else\n        to.lock()\n        from.lock()\n    from.withdraw(amount)\n    to.deposit(amount)\n    from.unlock()\n    to.unlock()\n\nThis solution gets more complicated when more locks are involved, and the transfer function needs to know about all of the locks, so they cannot be hidden.\n\nLanguage support\nProgramming languages vary in their support for synchronization:\n\nAda provides protected objects that have visible protected subprograms or entries as well as rendezvous.\nThe ISO/IEC C standard provides a standard mutual exclusion (locks) application programming interface (API) since C11. The current ISO/IEC C++ standard supports threading facilities since C++11. The OpenMP standard is supported by some compilers, and allows critical sections to be specified using pragmas. The POSIX pthread API provides lock support. Visual C++ provides the synchronize attribute of methods to be synchronized, but this is specific to COM objects in the Windows architecture and Visual C++ compiler. C and C++ can easily access any native operating system locking features.\nC# provides the lock keyword on a thread to ensure its exclusive access to a resource.\nVisual Basic (.NET) provides a SyncLock keyword like C#'s lock keyword.\nJava provides the keyword synchronized to lock code blocks, methods or objects and libraries featuring concurrency-safe data structures.\nObjective-C provides the keyword @synchronized to put locks on blocks of code and also provides the classes NSLock, NSRecursiveLock, and NSConditionLock along with the NSLocking protocol for locking as well.\nPHP provides a file-based locking  as well as a Mutex class in the pthreads extension. \nPython provides a low-level mutex mechanism with a Lock class from the threading module.\nThe ISO/IEC Fortran standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) provides the lock_type derived type in the intrinsic module iso_fortran_env and the lock/unlock statements since Fortran 2008.\nRuby provides a low-level mutex object and no keyword.\nRust provides the Mutex<T> struct.\nx86 assembly language provides the LOCK prefix on certain operations to guarantee their atomicity.\nHaskell implements locking via a mutable data structure called an MVar, which can either be empty or contain a value, typically a reference to a resource. A thread that wants to use the resource ‘takes’ the value of the MVar, leaving it empty, and puts it back when it is finished. Attempting to take a resource from an empty MVar results in the thread blocking until the resource is available. As an alternative to locking, an implementation of software transactional memory also exists.\nGo provides a low-level Mutex object in standard's library sync package. It can be used for locking code blocks, methods or objects.\n\nMutexes vs. semaphores\nSee also\nCritical section\nDouble-checked locking\nFile locking\nLock-free and wait-free algorithms\nMonitor (synchronization)\nMutual exclusion\nRead/write lock pattern\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTutorial on Locks and Critical Sections",

        "content": "In physics, a quantum (pl.: quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction. Quantum is a discrete quantity of energy proportional in magnitude to the frequency of the radiation it represents. The fundamental notion that a property can be \"quantized\" is referred to as \"the hypothesis of quantization\". This means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum. For example, a photon is a single quantum of light of a specific frequency (or of any other form of electromagnetic radiation). Similarly, the energy of an electron bound within an atom is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values. Atoms and matter in general are stable because electrons can exist only at discrete energy levels within an atom. Quantization is one of the foundations of the much broader physics of quantum mechanics. Quantization of energy and its influence on how energy and matter interact (quantum electrodynamics) is part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature.\n\nEtymology and discovery\nThe word quantum is the neuter singular of the Latin interrogative adjective quantus, meaning \"how much\". \"Quanta\", the neuter plural, short for \"quanta of electricity\" (electrons), was used in a 1902 article on the photoelectric effect by Philipp Lenard, who credited Hermann von Helmholtz for using the word in the area of electricity. However, the word quantum in general was well known before 1900, e.g. quantum was used in E. A. Poe's Loss of Breath. It was often used by physicians, such as in the term quantum satis, \"the amount which is enough\". Both Helmholtz and Julius von Mayer were physicians as well as physicists. Helmholtz used quantum with reference to heat in his article on Mayer's work, and the word quantum can be found in the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics by Mayer in his letter dated July 24, 1841.\n\nIn 1901, Max Planck used quanta to mean \"quanta of matter and electricity\", gas, and heat. In 1905, in response to Planck's work and the experimental work of Lenard (who explained his results by using the term quanta of electricity), Albert Einstein suggested that radiation existed in spatially localized packets which he called \"quanta of light\" (\"Lichtquanta\").\nThe concept of quantization of radiation was discovered in 1900 by Max Planck, who had been trying to understand the emission of radiation from heated objects, known as black-body radiation. By assuming that energy can be absorbed or released only in tiny, differential, discrete packets (which he called \"bundles\", or \"energy elements\"), Planck accounted for certain objects changing color when heated. On December 14, 1900, Planck reported his findings to the German Physical Society, and introduced the idea of quantization for the first time as a part of his research on black-body radiation. As a result of his experiments, Planck deduced the numerical value of h, known as the Planck constant, and reported more precise values for the unit of electrical charge and the Avogadro–Loschmidt number, the number of real molecules in a mole, to the German Physical Society. After his theory was validated, Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery in 1918.\n\nQuantization\nWhile quantization was first discovered in electromagnetic radiation, it describes a fundamental aspect of energy not just restricted to photons.\nIn the attempt to bring theory into agreement with experiment, Max Planck postulated that electromagnetic energy is absorbed or emitted in discrete packets, or quanta.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nHoffmann, Banesh (1959).

        "content": "Noyan Ozkose, better known by his online alias and gaming handle Genburten, is an Australian/Turkish professional Apex Legends player currently playing for 100 Thieves.\n\nApex Legends career\nEarly career and Reignite\nOf a Turkish background, he and his father are immigrants from Turkey; his father has supported his esports career. In 2021, Genburten signed with Reignite South. Genburten's teammates on Reignite included fellow Australians Rick \"Sharky\" Wirth and Rhys \"Zer0\" Perry. The trio played in the APAC South region. They would win the APAC South region's 2022 ALGS Pro League.\nGenburten was unable to play in the Year 2 Split 2 Playoffs LAN tournament, due to COVID-19 regulations. Genburten tested multiple times for COVID-19 around the time of the tournament, and although he received one negative test, he would test positive on the first day of the tournament. Reignite were still able to win, though without Genburten and instead with British loan player \"jmw\".\nOn 4 July 2022, Genburten left Reignite, along with Sharky and Zer0.\n\nDarkZero\nAfter leaving Reignite, the trio signed with the American organization DarkZero Esports. The team won the 2022 ALGS Championship LAN, held in Raleigh, North Carolina. Sharky would then leave the team, with Rody \"Xynew\" Geissle filling the roster spot. Genburten and DarkZero won the 2023 ALGS Split 2 Playoffs. With the victory, Genburten and Zer0 became the only 3-time LAN championship winners in AGLS history. Following the 2023 ALGS Championship, Genburten played trial matches with Sweetdreams and Nafen, but ultimately decided to remain with DarkZero.\nDuring the Year 4 North American Pro League regional finals, Genburten was one of two players to be affected by hacks. Genburten received a \"wallhack\", revealing the location of other players through walls and terrain. As the match was occurring on a private lobby during a high-profile match, the hack was considered unprecedented by media outlets. NME noted that Genburten quickly alerted his teammates and left the match, \"presumably to avoid some sort of penalty for cheating in an official tournament match\". Genburten detailed that he left after his teammate \"Sikezz\" suggested to and also stated that he feared his \"career was over\" because of the incident. With its competitive integrity compromised, the competition was postponed and held at a later date in secret, with Genburten and DarkZero placing in sixth. \nIn May, at the 2024 Split 1 Playoffs LAN, Genburten and DarkZero finished in second, runner-ups to Reject Winnity.\n\nTeam Falcons\nShortly following the 2024 Split 1 Playoffs LAN tournament, it was announced that Zer0 and Genburten would be leaving DarkZero. They joined forces with Phillip \"ImperialHal\" Dosen to form a \"superteam\" for the Split 2 season. It was initially unclear if the three would play under the DZ banner, though on 28 May, it was announced that the trio signed under the Saudi organization Team Falcons. The org is believed to have connections to the Al-Saud royal family. The three played together at the Apex Legends tournament during the 2024 Esports World Cup. Falcons had a disappointing 20th-place finish at the 2024 Split 2 Playoffs LAN. Following this, Genburten announced his departure from Falcons and that he would be joining iiTzTimmy and Dezignful on another squad. It is unclear if Genburten opted to leave Falcons on his own terms or if the team dropped him.\n\nThe Dojo/100 Thieves\nAfter leaving Falcons, Genburten became a member of The Dojo, joining the squad's previous members iiTzTimmy and Dezignful. On 12 November 2024, it was announced that the trio had been signed by 100 Thieves, marking the org's return to Apex Legends.\n\nPlayer profile\nGenburten serves as his team's fragger, with the role expected to provide a considerable amount of a team's kills and damage. Indeed, Genburten has been noted to record high amounts of both at competitive tournaments.\nApex players choose between mouse and keyboard or controller inputs; Genburten plays on the latter, being considered by video game media outlets one of the best controller players in the sport. As he plays on controller, Genburten has been noted to experiment with the input's sensitivity settings. Genburten has dealt with accusations of cheating throughout his career, which he has stated have been persistent.\n\nNotelist\n\n\n== References ==",

The \"Blue Patrol\" was a counterpart offered by Franco to Nazi Germany for its help with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War.\nBetween September 1941 and May 1943 five Spanish squadrons rotated through the Eastern Front, attached to Luftwaffe fighter wings Jagdgeschwader 27 and Jagdgeschwader 51.\nFlying Messerschmitt fighters and Focke-Wulf fighter-bombers, the Spaniards were credited with destroying more than 160 Soviet aircraft in nearly two years, while losing 20 pilots killed, missing, or captured. The unit remained in central Russia, despite requests by Muñoz Grandes that they be attached to the Blue Division, until their withdrawal in 1943.\n\nReferences\nSources\nBowen, Wayne H.

        "content": "Cannabis (), commonly known as marijuana (), weed, and pot, among other names, is a non-chemically uniform psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant. Native to Central or South Asia, cannabis has been used as a drug for both recreational and entheogenic purposes and in various traditional medicines for centuries. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract.\nCannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time, difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory, impaired body movement (balance and fine psychomotor control), relaxation, and an increase in appetite. Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, but may take up to 90 minutes when eaten (as orally consumed drugs must be digested and absorbed). The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used. At high doses, mental effects can include anxiety, delusions (including ideas of reference), hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and psychosis. There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the direction of causality is debated. Physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy; short-term side effects may also include dry mouth and red eyes. Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents, chronic coughing, susceptibility to respiratory infections, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.\nCannabis is mostly used recreationally or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). It is the most commonly used largely-illegal drug in the world, with the highest use among adults in Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria. Since the 1970s, the potency of illicit cannabis has increased, with THC levels rising and CBD levels dropping.\nCannabis plants have been grown since at least the 3rd millennium BCE and there is evidence of it being smoked for its psychoactive effects around 500 BCE in the Pamir Mountains, Central Asia. Since the 14th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions. The possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis has been illegal in most countries since the 20th century. In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize recreational use of cannabis. Other countries to do so are Canada, Georgia, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, South Africa, and Thailand. In the U.S., the recreational use of cannabis is legalized in 24 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia, though the drug remains federally illegal. In Australia, it is legalized only in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nEtymology\nCannabis is a Scythian word. The ancient Greeks learned of the use of cannabis  by observing Scythian funerals, during which cannabis was consumed. In Akkadian, cannabis was known as qunubu (𐎯𐎫𐎠𐎭𐏂). The word was adopted in to the Hebrew as qaneh bosem (קָנֶה בֹּשׂם).\n\nUses\nMedical\nMedical cannabis, or medical marijuana, refers to the use of cannabis to treat disease or improve symptoms; however, there is no single agreed-upon definition (e.g., cannabinoids derived from cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids are also used). The rigorous scientific study of cannabis as a medicine has been hampered by production restrictions and by the fact that it is classified as an illegal drug by many governments. There is some evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, or to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. Evidence for its use for other medical applications is insufficient for drawing conclusions about safety or efficacy. There is evidence supporting the use of cannabis or its derivatives in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, neuropathic pain, and multiple sclerosis. Lower levels of evidence support its use for AIDS wasting syndrome, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, and glaucoma.\nThe medical use of cannabis is legal only in a limited number of territories, including Canada, Belgium, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and many U.S. states. This usage generally requires a prescription, and distribution is usually done within a framework defined by local laws.\n\nRecreational\nAccording to DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge, Francis Young, \"cannabis is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man\". Being under the effects of cannabis is usually referred to as being \"high\". Cannabis consumption has both psychoactive and physiological effects. The \"high\" experience can vary widely, based (among other things) on the user's prior experience with cannabis, and the type of cannabis consumed.: p647  When smoking cannabis, a euphoriant effect can occur within minutes of smoking.: p104  Aside from a subjective change in perception and mood, the most common short-term physical and neurological effects include increased heart rate, increased appetite, impairment of short-term and working memory, and impairment of psychomotor coordination.\nAdditional desired effects from consuming cannabis include relaxation, a general alteration of conscious perception, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido and distortions in the perception of time and space. At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory or visual illusions, pseudohallucinations and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization.\n\nSpiritual\nCannabis has held sacred status in several religions and has served as an entheogen – a chemical substance used in religious, shamanic, or spiritual contexts – in the Indian subcontinent since the Vedic period. The earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the Indian subcontinent come from the Atharva Veda, estimated to have been composed sometime around 1400 BCE.\nThe Hindu god Shiva is described as a cannabis user, known as the \"Lord of bhang\".: p19 \nIn modern culture, the spiritual use of cannabis has been spread by the disciples of the Rastafari movement who use cannabis as a sacrament and as an aid to meditation.\n\nConsumption\nModes of consumption\nMany different ways to consume cannabis involve heat to decarboxylate THCA into THC; common modes include:\n\nSmoking, involves burning and inhaling cannabinoids (\"smoke\") from small pipes, bongs (portable versions of hookahs with a water chamber), paper-wrapped joints, tobacco-leaf-wrapped blunts, or the like.\nVaporizing, heating various forms of cannabis to 165–190 °C (329–374 °F), causing the active ingredients to form vapor without combustion of the plant material (the boiling point of THC is 157 °C (315 °F) at atmospheric pressure).\nEdibles, adding cannabis as an ingredient to a wide variety of foods, including butter and baked goods. In India it is commonly consumed as the beverage bhang.\nCannabis tea, prepared with attention to the lipophilic quality of THC, which is only slightly water-soluble (2.8 mg per liter), often involving cannabis in a saturated fat.\nTincture of cannabis, sometimes known as green dragon, is an alcoholic cannabis concentrate.\nCapsules, typically containing cannabis oil, and other dietary supplement products, for which some 220 were approved in Canada in 2018.\n\nConsumption by country\nIn 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). Cannabis is by far the most widely used illicit substance, with the highest use among adults (as of 2018) in Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria.\n\nUnited States\nBetween 1973 and 1978, eleven states decriminalized marijuana. In 2001, Nevada reduced marijuana possession to a misdemeanor and since 2012, several other states have decriminalized and even legalized marijuana.\nIn 2018, surveys indicated that almost half of the people in the United States had tried marijuana, 16% had used it in the past year, and 11% had used it in the past month. In 2014, surveys said daily marijuana use amongst US college students had reached its highest level since records began in 1980, rising from 3.5% in 2007 to 5.9% in 2014 and had surpassed daily cigarette use.\nIn the US, men are over twice as likely to use marijuana as women, and 18–29-year-olds are six times more likely to use as over-65-year-olds. In 2015, a record 44% of the US population has tried marijuana in their lifetime, an increase from 38% in 2013 and 33% in 1985.\nMarijuana use in the United States is three times above the global average, but in line with other Western democracies. Forty-four percent of American 12th graders have tried the drug at least once, and the typical age of first-use is 16, similar to the typical age of first-use for alcohol but lower than the first-use age for other illicit drugs.\nA 2022 Gallup poll concluded Americans are smoking more marijuana than cigarettes for the first time.\n\nAdverse effects\nShort-term\nAcute negative effects may include anxiety and panic, impaired attention and memory, an increased risk of psychotic symptoms, the inability to think clearly, and an increased risk of accidents. Cannabis impairs a person's driving ability, and THC was the illicit drug most frequently found in the blood of drivers who have been involved in vehicle crashes. Those with THC in their system are from three to seven times more likely to be the cause of the accident than those who had not used either cannabis or alcohol, although its role is not necessarily causal because THC stays in the bloodstream for days to weeks after intoxication.\nSome immediate undesired side effects include a decrease in short-term memory, dry mouth, impaired motor skills, reddening of the eyes, dizziness, feeling tired and vomiting. Some users may experience an episode of acute psychosis, which usually abates after six hours, but in rare instances, heavy users may find the symptoms continuing for many days.\nLegalization has increased the rates at which children are exposed to cannabis, particularly from edibles. While the toxicity and lethality of THC in children is not known, they are at risk for encephalopathy, hypotension, respiratory depression severe enough to require ventilation, somnolence and coma.\n\nFatality\nThere is no clear evidence for a link between cannabis use and deaths from cardiovascular disease, but a 2019 review noted that it may be an under-reported, contributory factor or direct cause in cases of sudden death, due to the strain it can place on the cardiovascular system. Some deaths have also been attributed to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. There is an association between cannabis use and suicide, particularly in younger users.\nA 16-month survey of Oregon and Alaska emergency departments found a report of the death of an adult who had been admitted for acute cannabis toxicity.\nA recent study in 2025 suggests that individuals diagnosed with cannabis use disorder—characterized by an inability to stop using cannabis despite its negative effects—face a nearly threefold increase in mortality rates compared to those without the condition over a five-year period. The research indicates that people with this disorder are ten times more likely to die by suicide than the general population. Additionally, they have a higher risk of death from trauma, drug poisoning, and lung cancer. In a separate study researchers found an increase in schizophrenia and psychosis cases in Canada linked to cannabis use disorder following the drug’s legalization.\n\nLong-term\nPsychological effects\nA 2015 meta-analysis found that, although a longer period of abstinence was associated with smaller magnitudes of impairment, both retrospective and prospective memory were impaired in cannabis users. The authors concluded that some, but not all, of the deficits associated with cannabis use were reversible. A 2012 meta-analysis found that deficits in most domains of cognition persisted beyond the acute period of intoxication, but was not evident in studies where subjects were abstinent for more than 25 days. Few high quality studies have been performed on the long-term effects of cannabis on cognition, and the results were generally inconsistent. Furthermore, effect sizes of significant findings were generally small. One review concluded that, although most cognitive faculties were unimpaired by cannabis use, residual deficits occurred in executive functions. Impairments in executive functioning are most consistently found in older populations, which may reflect heavier cannabis exposure, or developmental effects associated with adolescent cannabis use. One review found three prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between self-reported cannabis use and intelligence quotient (IQ). The study following the largest number of heavy cannabis users reported that IQ declined between ages 7–13 and age 38. Poorer school performance and increased incidence of leaving school early were both associated with cannabis use, although a causal relationship was not established. Cannabis users demonstrated increased activity in task-related brain regions, consistent with reduced processing efficiency.\nA reduced quality of life is associated with heavy cannabis use, although the relationship is inconsistent and weaker than for tobacco and other substances. The direction of cause and effect, however, is unclear.\nThe long-term effects of cannabis are not clear. There are concerns surrounding memory and cognition problems, risk of addiction, and the risk of schizophrenia in young people.\n\nNeuroimaging\nAlthough global abnormalities in white matter and grey matter are not consistently associated with cannabis use, reduced hippocampal volume is consistently found. Amygdala abnormalities are sometimes reported, although findings are inconsistent.\nCannabis use is associated with increased recruitment of task-related areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is thought to reflect compensatory activity due to reduced processing efficiency. Cannabis use is also associated with downregulation of CB1 receptors. The magnitude of down regulation is associated with cumulative cannabis exposure, and is reversed after one month of abstinence. There is limited evidence that chronic cannabis use can reduce levels of glutamate metabolites in the human brain.\n\nCannabis dependence\nAbout 9% of those who experiment with marijuana eventually become dependent according to DSM-IV (1994) criteria. A 2013 review estimates daily use is associated with a 10–20% rate of dependence. The highest risk of cannabis dependence is found in those with a history of poor academic achievement, deviant behavior in childhood and adolescence, rebelliousness, poor parental relationships, or a parental history of drug and alcohol problems. Of daily users, about 50% experience withdrawal upon cessation of use (i.e. are dependent), characterized by sleep problems, irritability, dysphoria, and craving. Cannabis withdrawal is less severe than withdrawal from alcohol.\nAccording to DSM-V criteria, 9% of those who are exposed to cannabis develop cannabis use disorder, compared to 20% for cocaine, 23% for alcohol and 68% for nicotine. Cannabis use disorder in the DSM-V involves a combination of DSM-IV criteria for cannabis abuse and dependence, plus the addition of craving, without the criterion related to legal troubles.\n\nPsychiatric\nFrom a clinical perspective, two significant school of thought exists for psychiatric conditions associated with cannabis (or cannabinoids) use: transient, non-persistent psychotic reactions, and longer-lasting, persistent disorders that resemble schizophrenia. The former is formally known as acute cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms (CAPS). \nAt an epidemiological level, a dose–response relationship exists between cannabis use and increased risk of psychosis and earlier onset of psychosis. Although the epidemiological association is robust, evidence to prove a causal relationship is lacking.\nCannabis may also increase the risk of depression, but insufficient research has been performed to draw a conclusion. Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of anxiety disorders, although causality has not been established.\nA review in 2019 found that research was insufficient to determine the safety and efficacy of using cannabis to treat schizophrenia, psychosis, or other mental disorders. Another found that cannabis during adolescence was associated with an increased risk of developing depression and suicidal behavior later in life, while finding no effect on anxiety.\n\nPhysical\nHeavy, long-term exposure to marijuana may have physical, mental, behavioral and social health consequences. It may be \"associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis C), lungs, heart, and vasculature\". A 2014 review found that while cannabis use may be less harmful than alcohol use, the recommendation to substitute it for problematic drinking was premature without further study. Various surveys conducted between 2015 and 2019 found that many users of cannabis substitute it for prescription drugs (including opioids), alcohol, and tobacco; most of those who used it in place of alcohol or tobacco either reduced or stopped their intake of the latter substances.\nCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a severe condition seen in some chronic cannabis users where they have repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting for 24–48 hours.\nFour cases of death have been reported as a result of CHS.\nA limited number of studies have examined the effects of cannabis smoking on the respiratory system. Chronic heavy marijuana smoking is associated with respiratory infections, coughing, production of sputum, wheezing, and other symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The available evidence does not support a causal relationship between cannabis use and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Short-term use of cannabis is associated with bronchodilation. Other side effects of cannabis use include cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a condition which involves recurrent nausea, cramping abdominal pain, and vomiting.\nCannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic chemical compounds. This tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke, and over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke, including; nitrosamines, reactive aldehydes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including benz[a]pyrene. Cannabis smoke is also inhaled more deeply than tobacco smoke. As of 2015, there is no consensus regarding whether cannabis smoking is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer. Evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy, long-term use. In general there are far lower risks of pulmonary complications for regular cannabis smokers when compared with those of tobacco. A 2015 review found an association between cannabis use and the development of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), particularly non-seminoma TGCTs. Another 2015 meta-analysis found no association between lifetime cannabis use and risk of head or neck cancer. Combustion products are not present when using a vaporizer, consuming THC in pill form, or consuming cannabis foods.\nThere is concern that cannabis may contribute to cardiovascular disease, but as of 2018, evidence of this relationship was unclear. Research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco, and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine that are known to have cardiovascular risk factors. Smoking cannabis has also been shown to increase the risk of myocardial infarction by 4.8 times for the 60 minutes after consumption.\nThere is preliminary evidence that cannabis interferes with the anticoagulant properties of prescription drugs used for treating blood clots. As of 2019, the mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory and possible pain relieving effects of cannabis were not defined, and there were no governmental regulatory approvals or clinical practices for use of cannabis as a drug.\n\nEmergency department visits\nEmergency room (ER) admissions associated with cannabis use rose significantly from 2012 to 2016; adolescents from age 12–17 had the highest risk. At one Colorado medical center following legalization, approximately two percent of ER admissions were classified as cannabis users. The symptoms of one quarter of these users were partially attributed to cannabis (a total of 2567 out of 449,031 patients); other drugs were sometimes involved. Of these cannabis admissions, one quarter were for acute psychiatric effects, primarily suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety. An additional third of the cases were for gastrointestinal issues including cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.\nAccording to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011. These statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use. The drug use must be \"implicated\" in the emergency department visit, but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit. Most of the illicit drug emergency room visits involved multiple drugs. In 129,000 cases, cannabis was the only implicated drug.\n\nReproductive health\nSecondhand cannabis smoke\nA 2022 study found that smoking cannabis using a bong can greatly increase background levels of fine particulate matter, a carcinogen, in an enclosed space such as a living room. After 15 minutes, mean levels of particulate matter were more than twice the Environmental Protection Agency hazardous air quality threshold, and after 140 minutes, the concentrations were four times greater than those generated by smoking tobacco using a cigarette or hookah. This suggests secondhand cannabis smoke from bongs may present a health risk to non-smokers.\n\nPharmacology\nMechanism of action\nTHC is a weak partial agonist at CB1 receptors, while CBD is a CB1 receptor antagonist.\nThe CB1 receptor is found primarily in the brain as well as in some peripheral tissues, and the CB2 receptor is found primarily in peripheral tissues, but is also expressed in neuroglial cells. THC appears to alter mood and cognition through its agonist actions on the CB1 receptors, which inhibit a secondary messenger system (adenylate cyclase) in a dose-dependent manner.\nVia CB1 receptor activation, THC indirectly increases dopamine release and produces psychotropic effects. CBD also acts as an allosteric modulator of the μ- and δ-opioid receptors. THC also potentiates the effects of the glycine receptors. It is unknown if or how these actions contribute to the effects of cannabis.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nThe high lipid-solubility of cannabinoids results in their persisting in the body for long periods of time. Even after a single administration of THC, detectable levels of THC can be found in the body for weeks or longer (depending on the amount administered and the sensitivity of the assessment method). Investigators have suggested that this is an important factor in marijuana's effects, perhaps because cannabinoids may accumulate in the body, particularly in the lipid membranes of neurons.\n\nChemistry\nChemical composition\nThe main psychoactive component of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is formed via decarboxylation of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) from the application of heat. Raw leaf is not psychoactive because the cannabinoids are in the form of carboxylic acids. THC is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD).\n\nDetection in body fluids\nTHC and its major (inactive) metabolite, THC-COOH, can be measured in blood, urine, hair, oral fluid or sweat using chromatographic techniques as part of a drug use testing program or a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal offense. The concentrations obtained from such analyses can often be helpful in distinguishing active use from passive exposure, elapsed time since use, and extent or duration of use. These tests cannot, however, distinguish authorized cannabis smoking for medical purposes from unauthorized recreational smoking. Commercial cannabinoid immunoassays, often employed as the initial screening method when testing physiological specimens for marijuana presence, have different degrees of cross-reactivity with THC and its metabolites. Urine contains predominantly THC-COOH, while hair, oral fluid and sweat contain primarily THC. Blood may contain both substances, with the relative amounts dependent on the recency and extent of usage.\nThe Duquenois–Levine test is commonly used as a screening test in the field, but it cannot definitively confirm the presence of cannabis, as a large range of substances have been shown to give false positives. Researchers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of THC and other drugs in urine. However, a 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Utah School of Medicine refute the possibility of self-administered zinc producing false-negative urine drug tests.\n\nVarieties and strains\nCBD is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, which is under laboratory research to determine if it has an anxiolytic effect. It is often claimed that sativa strains provide a more stimulating psychoactive high while indica strains are more sedating with a body high. However, this is disputed by researchers.\nA 2015 review found that the use of high CBD-to-THC strains of cannabis showed significantly fewer positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, better cognitive function and both lower risk for developing psychosis, as well as a later age of onset of the illness, compared to cannabis with low CBD-to-THC ratios.\n\nPsychoactive ingredients\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), \"the amount of THC present in a cannabis sample is generally used as a measure of cannabis potency.\" The three main forms of cannabis products are the flower/fruit, resin (hashish), and oil (hash oil). The UNODC states that cannabis often contains 5% THC content, resin \"can contain up to 20% THC content\", and that \"Cannabis oil may contain more than 60% THC content.\"\nStudies have found that the potency of illicit cannabis has greatly increased since the 1970s, with THC levels rising and CBD levels dropping. It is unclear, however, whether the increase in THC content has caused people to consume more THC or if users adjust based on the potency of the cannabis. It is likely that the higher THC content allows people to ingest less tar. At the same time, CBD levels in seized samples have lowered, in part because of the desire to produce higher THC levels and because more illegal growers cultivate indoors using artificial lights. This helps avoid detection but reduces the CBD production of the plant.\nAustralia's National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre (NCPIC) states that the buds (infructescences) of the female Cannabis plant contain the highest concentration of THC, followed by the leaves. The stalks and seeds have \"much lower THC levels\". The UN states that the leaves can contain ten times less THC than the buds, and the stalks 100 times less THC.\nAfter revisions to cannabis scheduling in the UK, the government moved cannabis back from a class C to a class B drug. A purported reason was the appearance of high potency cannabis. They believe skunk accounts for between 70% and 80% of samples seized by police (despite the fact that skunk can sometimes be incorrectly mistaken for all types of herbal cannabis). Extracts such as hashish and hash oil typically contain more THC than high potency cannabis infructescences.\n\nLaced cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids\nHemp buds (or low-potency cannabis buds) laced with synthetic cannabinoids started to be sold as cannabis street drug in 2020.\nThe short-term effects of cannabis can be altered if it has been laced with opioid drugs such as heroin or fentanyl. The added drugs are meant to enhance the psychoactive properties, add to its weight, and increase profitability, despite the increased danger of overdose.\n\nPreparations\nMarijuana\nMarijuana or marihuana (herbal cannabis) consists of the dried flowers and fruits and subtending leaves and stems of the female cannabis plant. This is the most widely consumed form, containing 3% to 20% THC, with reports of up to 33% THC. This is the stock material from which all other preparations are derived. Although herbal cannabis and industrial hemp derive from the same species and contain the psychoactive component (THC), they are distinct strains with unique biochemical compositions and uses. Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of CBD, which gives lesser psychoactive effects.\n\nKief\nKief is a powder, rich in trichomes, which can be sifted from the leaves, flowers and fruits of cannabis plants and either consumed in powder form or compressed to produce cakes of hashish. The word \"kif\" derives from colloquial Arabic كيف kēf/kīf, meaning pleasure.\n\nHashish\nHashish (also spelled hasheesh, hashisha, or simply hash) is a concentrated resin cake or ball produced from pressed kief, the detached trichomes and fine material that falls off cannabis fruits, flowers and leaves, or from scraping the resin from the surface of the plants and rolling it into balls. It varies in color from black to golden brown depending upon purity and variety of cultivar it was obtained from. It can be consumed orally or smoked, and is also vaporized, or 'vaped'. The term \"rosin hash\" refers to a high quality solventless product obtained through heat and pressure.\n\nTincture\nCannabinoids can be extracted from cannabis plant matter using high-proof spirits (often grain alcohol) to create a tincture, often referred to as \"green dragon\".: p17  Nabiximols is a branded product name from a tincture manufacturing pharmaceutical company.\n\nHash oil\nHash oil is a resinous matrix of cannabinoids obtained from the cannabis plant by solvent extraction, formed into a hardened or viscous mass. Hash oil can be the most potent of the main cannabis products because of its high level of psychoactive compound per its volume, which can vary depending on the plant's mix of essential oils and psychoactive compounds. Butane and supercritical carbon dioxide hash oil have become popular in recent years.\n\nInfusions\nThere are many varieties of cannabis infusions owing to the variety of non-volatile solvents used. The plant material is mixed with the solvent and then pressed and filtered to express the oils of the plant into the solvent. Examples of solvents used in this process are cocoa butter, dairy butter, cooking oil, glycerine, and skin moisturizers. Depending on the solvent, these may be used in cannabis foods or applied topically.\n\nMarihuana prensada\nMarihuana prensada ('pressed marijuana') is a cannabis-derived product widespread among the lower classes of South America, especially from the 90s. Locally it is known as \"paraguayo\" or \"paragua\", since its main producer is Paraguay. Marijuana is dried and mixed with binding agents that make it toxic and highly harmful to health. It is cut into the shape of bricks (ladrillos) and sold for a low price in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, and even the United States.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nCannabis is indigenous to Central or South Asia and its uses for fabric and rope dates back to the Neolithic age in China and Japan. It is unclear when cannabis first became known for its psychoactive properties. The oldest archeological evidence for the burning of cannabis was found in Romanian kurgans dated 3,500 BC, and scholars suggest that the drug was first used in ritual ceremonies by Proto-Indo-European tribes living in the Pontic-Caspian steppe during the Chalcolithic period, a custom they eventually spread throughout Western Eurasia during the Indo-European migrations. Some research suggests that the ancient Indo-Iranian drug soma, mentioned in the Vedas, sometimes contained cannabis. This is based on the discovery of a basin containing cannabis in a shrine of the second millennium BC in Turkmenistan.\nCannabis was known to the ancient Assyrians, who discovered its psychoactive properties through the Iranians. Using it in some religious ceremonies, they called it qunubu (meaning \"way to produce smoke\"), a probable origin of the modern word cannabis. The Iranians also introduced cannabis to the Scythians, Thracians and Dacians, whose shamans (the kapnobatai – \"those who walk on smoke/clouds\") burned cannabis infructescences to induce trance. The plant was used in China before 2800 BC, and found therapeutic use in India by 1000 BC, where it was used in food and drink, including bhang.\n\nCannabis has an ancient history of ritual use and has been used by religions around the world. It has been used as a drug for both recreational and entheogenic purposes and in various traditional medicines for centuries. The earliest evidence of cannabis smoking has been found in the 2,500-year-old tombs of Jirzankal Cemetery in the Pamir Mountains in Western China, where cannabis residue were found in burners with charred pebbles possibly used during funeral rituals. Hemp seeds discovered by archaeologists at Pazyryk suggest early ceremonial practices like eating by the Scythians occurred during the 5th to 2nd century BC, confirming previous historical reports by Herodotus. It was used by Muslims in various Sufi orders as early as the Mamluk period, for example by the Qalandars. Smoking pipes uncovered in Ethiopia and carbon-dated to around c. AD 1320 were found to have traces of cannabis.\n\nModern history\nCannabis was introduced to the New World by the Spaniards in 1530–1545. Following an 1836–1840 travel in North Africa and the Middle East, French physician Jacques-Joseph Moreau wrote on the psychological effects of cannabis use; he founded the Paris' Club des Hashischins in 1844. In 1842, Irish physician William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, who had studied the drug while working as a medical officer in Bengal with the East India Company, brought a quantity of cannabis with him on his return to Britain, provoking renewed interest in the West. Examples of classic literature of the period featuring cannabis include Les paradis artificiels (1860) by Charles Baudelaire and The Hasheesh Eater (1857) by Fitz Hugh Ludlow.\n\nCannabis was criminalized in some countries beginning in the 14th century and was illegal in most countries by the middle of the 20th century. The colonial government of Mauritius banned cannabis in 1840 over concerns on its effect on Indian indentured workers; the same occurred in Singapore in 1870. In the United States, the first restrictions on sale of cannabis came in 1906 (in the District of Columbia). Canada criminalized cannabis in The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, before any reports of the use of the drug in Canada, but eventually legalized its consumption for recreational and medicinal purposes in 2018.\nIn 1925, a compromise was made at an international conference in The Hague about the International Opium Convention that banned exportation of \"Indian hemp\" to countries that had prohibited its use, and requiring importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required \"exclusively for medical or scientific purposes\". It also required parties to \"exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin\". In the United States in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, and prohibited the production of hemp in addition to cannabis.\n\nIn 1972, the Dutch government divided drugs into more- and less-dangerous categories, with cannabis being in the lesser category. Accordingly, possession of 30 grams (1.1 oz) or less was made a misdemeanor. Cannabis has been available for recreational use in coffee shops since 1976. Cannabis products are only sold openly in certain local \"coffeeshops\" and possession of up to 5 grams (0.18 oz) for personal use is decriminalized, however: the police may still confiscate it, which often happens in car checks near the border. Other types of sales and transportation are not permitted, although the general approach toward cannabis was lenient even before official decriminalization.\nIn Uruguay, President Jose Mujica signed legislation to legalize recreational cannabis in December 2013, making Uruguay the first country in the modern era to legalize cannabis. In August 2014, Uruguay legalized growing up to six plants at home, as well as the formation of growing clubs (Cannabis social club), and a state-controlled marijuana dispensary regime.\nAs of 17 October 2018, when recreational use of cannabis was legalized in Canada, dietary supplements for human use and veterinary health products containing not more than 10 parts per million of THC extract were approved for marketing; Nabiximols (as Sativex) is used as a prescription drug in Canada.\nThe United Nations' World Drug Report stated that cannabis \"was the world's most widely produced, trafficked, and consumed drug in the world in 2010\", and estimated between 128 million and 238 million users globally in 2015.\n\nCulture, legality and economics\nCulture\nCannabis has been one of the most used psychoactive drugs in the world since the late 20th century, following only tobacco and alcohol in popularity. According to Vera Rubin, the use of cannabis has been encompassed by two major cultural complexes over time: a continuous, traditional folk stream, and a more circumscribed, contemporary configuration. The former involves both sacred and secular use, and is usually based on small-scale cultivation: the use of the plant for cordage, clothing, medicine, food, and a \"general use as an euphoriant and symbol of fellowship.\" The second stream of expansion of cannabis use encompasses \"the use of hemp for commercial manufacturers utilizing large-scale cultivation primarily as a fiber for mercantile purposes\"; but it is also linked to the search for psychedelic experiences (which can be traced back to the formation of the Parisian Club des Hashischins).\n\nLegality\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, most countries have enacted laws against the cultivation, possession or transfer of cannabis. These laws have had an adverse effect on cannabis cultivation for non-recreational purposes, but there are many regions where handling of cannabis is legal or licensed. Many jurisdictions have lessened the penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis so that it is punished by confiscation and sometimes a fine, rather than imprisonment, focusing more on those who traffic the drug on the black market.\nIn some areas where cannabis use had been historically tolerated, new restrictions were instituted, such as the closing of cannabis coffee shops near the borders of the Netherlands, and closing of coffee shops near secondary schools in the Netherlands. In Copenhagen, Denmark in 2014, mayor Frank Jensen discussed possibilities for the city to legalize cannabis production and commerce.\nSome jurisdictions use free voluntary or mandatory treatment programs for frequent known users. Simple possession can carry long prison terms in some countries, particularly in East Asia, where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution. Political parties, non-profit organizations, and causes based on the legalization of medical cannabis or legalizing the plant entirely (with some restrictions) have emerged in such countries as China and Thailand.\n\nIn December 2012, the U.S. state of Washington became the first state to officially legalize cannabis in a state law (Washington Initiative 502) (but still illegal by federal law), with the state of Colorado following close behind (Colorado Amendment 64). On 1 January 2013, the first cannabis \"club\" for private marijuana smoking (no buying or selling, however) was allowed for the first time in Colorado. The California Supreme Court decided in May 2013 that local governments can ban medical cannabis dispensaries despite a state law in California that permits the use of cannabis for medical purposes. At least 180 cities across California have enacted bans in recent years. \nOn 30 April 2024, the United States Department of Justice announced it would move to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance.\nIn December 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize growing, sale and use of cannabis. After a long delay in implementing the retail component of the law, in 2017 sixteen pharmacies were authorized to sell cannabis commercially. On 19 June 2018, the Canadian Senate passed a bill and the Prime Minister announced the effective legalization date as 17 October 2018. Canada is the second country to legalize the drug.\nIn November 2015, Uttarakhand became the first state of India to legalize the cultivation of hemp for industrial purposes. Usage within the Hindu and Buddhist cultures of the Indian subcontinent is common, with many street vendors in India openly selling products infused with cannabis, and traditional medical practitioners in Sri Lanka selling products infused with cannabis for recreational purposes and well as for religious celebrations. Indian laws criminalizing cannabis date back to the colonial period. India and Sri Lanka have allowed cannabis to be taken in the context of traditional culture for recreational/celebratory purposes and also for medicinal purposes.\nOn 17 October 2015, Australian health minister Sussan Ley presented a new law that will allow the cultivation of cannabis for scientific research and medical trials on patients.\nOn 17 October 2018, Canada legalized cannabis for recreational adult use making it the second country in the world to do so after Uruguay and the first G7 nation. This legalization comes with regulation similar to that of alcohol in Canada, age restrictions, limiting home production, distribution, consumption areas and sale times. Laws around use vary from province to province including age limits, retail structure, and growing at home. The Canadian Licensed Producer system aims to become the Gold Standard in the world for safe and secure cannabis production, including provisions for a robust craft cannabis industry where many expect opportunities for experimenting with different strains. \nAs the drug has increasingly been seen as a health issue instead of criminal behavior, cannabis has also been legalized or decriminalized in: Czech Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Portugal, South Africa and Canada. Medical marijuana was legalized in Mexico in mid-2017 and legalized for recreational use in June 2021.\nGermany legalized cannabis for recreational use in April 2024.\n\nLegal status by country\nAs of 2022, Uruguay and Canada are the only countries that have fully legalized the cultivation, consumption and bartering of recreational cannabis nationwide. In the United States, 24 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of cannabis – though the drug remains illegal at the federal level. Laws vary from state to state when it comes to the commercial sale. Court rulings in Georgia and South Africa have led to the legalization of cannabis consumption, but not legal sales. A policy of limited enforcement has also been adopted in many countries, in particular Spain and the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis is tolerated at licensed establishments. Contrary to popular belief, cannabis is not legal in the Netherlands, but it has been decriminalized since the 1970s. In 2021, Malta was the first European Union member to legalize the use of cannabis for recreational purposes. In Estonia, it is only legal to sell cannabis products with a THC content of less than 0.2%, although products may contain more cannabidiol. Lebanon has recently become the first Arab country to legalize the plantation of cannabis for medical use.\nPenalties for illegal recreational use ranges from confiscation or small fines to jail time and even death. In some countries citizens can be punished if they have used the drug in another country, including Singapore and South Korea.\n\nEconomics\nProduction\nSinsemilla (Spanish for \"without seed\") is the dried, seedless (i.e. parthenocarpic) infructescences of female cannabis plants. Because THC production drops off once pollination occurs, the male plants (which produce little THC themselves) are eliminated before they shed pollen to prevent pollination, thus inducing the development of parthenocarpic fruits gathered in dense infructescences. Advanced cultivation techniques such as hydroponics, cloning, high-intensity artificial lighting, and the sea of green method are frequently employed as a response (in part) to prohibition enforcement efforts that make outdoor cultivation more risky.\n\"Skunk\" refers to several named strains of potent cannabis, grown through selective breeding and sometimes hydroponics. It is a cross-breed of Cannabis sativa and C. indica (although other strains of this mix exist in abundance). Skunk cannabis potency ranges usually from 6% to 15% and rarely as high as 20%. The average THC level in coffee shops in the Netherlands is about 18–19%.\nThe average levels of THC in cannabis sold in the United States rose dramatically between the 1970s and 2000. This is disputed for various reasons, and there is little consensus as to whether this is a fact or an artifact of poor testing methodologies. According to Daniel Forbes writing for slate.com, the relative strength of modern strains are likely skewed because undue weight is given to much more expensive and potent, but less prevalent, samples. Some suggest that results are skewed by older testing methods that included low-THC-content plant material such as leaves in the samples, which are excluded in contemporary tests. Others believe that modern strains actually are significantly more potent than older ones.\nThe main producing countries of cannabis are Afghanistan, Canada, China, Colombia, India, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Paraguay, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nPrice\nThe price or street value of cannabis varies widely depending on geographic area and potency. Prices and overall markets have also varied considerably over time.\n\nIn 1997, cannabis was estimated to be overall the number four value crop in the US, and number one or two in many states, including California, New York, and Florida. This estimate is based on a value to growers of ~60% of retail value, or $3,000 per pound ($6,600/kg).\nIn 2006, cannabis was estimated to have been a $36 billion market. This estimate has been challenged as exaggerated. The UN World Drug Report (2008) estimated that 2006 street prices in the US and Canada ranged from about US$8.8 to $25 per gram (approximately $250 to $700 per ounce), depending on quality. Typical U.S. retail prices were $10–15 per gram (approximately $280–420 per ounce).\nIn 2017, the U.S. was estimated to constitute 90% of the worldwide $9.5 billion legal trade in cannabis.\nAfter some U.S. states legalized cannabis, street prices began to drop. In Colorado, the price of smokable buds (infructescences) dropped 40 percent between 2014 and 2019, from $200 per ounce to $120 per ounce ($7 per gram to $4.19 per gram).\nThe European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports that typical retail prices in Europe for cannabis varied from €2 to €20 per gram in 2008, with a majority of European countries reporting prices in the range €4–10.\n\nCannabis as a gateway drug\nThe gateway hypothesis states that cannabis use increases the probability of trying \"harder\" drugs. The hypothesis has been hotly debated as it is regarded by some as the primary rationale for the United States prohibition on cannabis use. A Pew Research Center poll found that political opposition to marijuana use was significantly associated with concerns about the health effects and whether legalization would increase cannabis use by children.\nSome studies state that while there is no proof for the gateway hypothesis, young cannabis users should still be considered as a risk group for intervention programs. Other findings indicate that hard drug users are likely to be poly-drug users, and that interventions must address the use of multiple drugs instead of a single hard drug. Almost two-thirds of the poly drug users in the 2009–2010 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey used cannabis.\nThe gateway effect may appear due to social factors involved in using any illegal drug. Because of the illegal status of cannabis, its consumers are likely to find themselves in situations allowing them to acquaint with individuals using or selling other illegal drugs. Studies have shown that alcohol and tobacco may additionally be regarded as gateway drugs; however, a more parsimonious explanation could be that cannabis is simply more readily available (and at an earlier age) than illegal hard drugs. In turn, alcohol and tobacco are typically easier to obtain at an earlier age than is cannabis (though the reverse may be true in some areas), thus leading to the \"gateway sequence\" in those individuals, since they are most likely to experiment with any drug offered.\nA related alternative to the gateway hypothesis is the common liability to addiction (CLA) theory. It states that some individuals are, for various reasons, willing to try multiple recreational substances. The \"gateway\" drugs are merely those that are (usually) available at an earlier age than the harder drugs. Researchers have noted in an extensive review that it is dangerous to present the sequence of events described in gateway \"theory\" in causative terms as this hinders both research and intervention.\nIn 2020, the National Institute on Drug Abuse released a study backing allegations that marijuana is a gateway to harder drugs, though not for the majority of marijuana users. The National Institute on Drug Abuse determined that marijuana use is \"likely to precede use of other licit and illicit substances\" and that \"adults who reported marijuana use during the first wave of the survey were more likely than adults who did not use marijuana to develop an alcohol use disorder within 3 years; people who used marijuana and already had an alcohol use disorder at the outset were at greater risk of their alcohol use disorder worsening. Marijuana use is also linked to other substance use disorders including nicotine addiction.\" It also reported that \"These findings are consistent with the idea of marijuana as a \"gateway drug\". However, the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, \"harder\" substances. Also, cross-sensitization is not unique to marijuana. Alcohol and nicotine also prime the brain for a heightened response to other drugs and are, like marijuana, also typically used before a person progresses to other, more harmful substances.\"\n\nResearch\nResearch on cannabis is challenging since the plant is illegal in most countries. Research-grade samples of the drug are difficult to obtain for research purposes, unless granted under authority of national regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration.\nThere are also other difficulties in researching the effects of cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco. This causes confounding factors, where questions arise as to whether the tobacco, the cannabis, or both that have caused a cancer. Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies. Because cannabis is an illegal drug in many countries, people may be reluctant to take part in research, and if they do agree to take part, they may not say how much cannabis they actually smoke.\n\nSee also\nCannabis rights\nGlossary of cannabis terms\nList of books about cannabis\nList of celebrities who own cannabis businesses\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nExternal links\n\n Media related to Cannabis at Wikimedia Commons\n The dictionary definition of marijuana at Wiktionary",

        "content": "Sweet Anita (born 28 July 1990) is an English streamer and YouTuber.\n\nEarly life\nAnita was born in East Anglia on 28 July 1990, and was raised by a single mother. She later moved to South West England. She was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, including the rare symptom of coprolalia, at the age of 27. She exhibited symptoms of the disorder throughout her teenage years and could only participate in formal education for a year because of her tics. She attempted to get a diagnosis when she was 13 but the doctor did not take her symptoms seriously, claimed she would grow out of it, and dismissed her as seeking attention; over a decade later, she visited a hospital in another attempt to get a diagnosis, and was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome after a week of tests.\n\nCareer\nAnita began streaming on Twitch in 2018. Her early streams consisted of gaming content, primarily Overwatch. She quickly gained popularity after clips of her profanity-laden outbursts, caused by her Tourette syndrome, went viral. Later that year, Variety named her among the most influential people in video games. In 2019, she was nominated for her first major award at the 11th Shorty Awards for \"Twitch Streamer of the Year\". In December 2020, she hosted VY Esports' online gaming festival LuudoFest.\n\nCharity work\nAnita has hosted multiple fundraisers for the charity Tourettes Action.\n\nPersonal life\nAnita identifies as demisexual. She rehabilitates animals in her spare time and has cared for several rabbits, rats, and chinchillas. She also ran her own business selling sea glass that she collected from the seashore. She has discussed her experience with Tourette syndrome in several interviews in an effort to raise awareness and promote education on its effects, by citing examples such as its impact on daily social interactions.\nAnita has been a victim of deepfake porn and online harassment, raising concerns about the lack of legal protections and difficulty removing such content from the internet. Efforts are being made to advocate for federal legislation and raise awareness about the issue of revenge porn and its impact on victims. In mid-2019, she revealed that she was experiencing long-term harassment and abuse from an unidentified stalker. She criticised the police's handling of the situation in a tweet that said, \"If anything happens to me, I really hope that I'm the last canary in the coal mine. The law needs to change. No job should have such a high risk of rape, assault or death, especially not live streaming.\" In September 2020, she released a YouTube video detailing her ordeal along with the experience of several other online personalities in regards to stalking.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\n== References ==",

        "streamer": "SCRAP",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrap",
        "content": "Scrap consists of recyclable materials, usually metals, left over from product manufacturing and consumption, such as parts of vehicles, building supplies, and surplus materials. Unlike waste, scrap can have monetary value, especially recovered metals, and non-metallic materials are also recovered for recycling. Once collected, the materials are sorted into types – typically metal scrap will be crushed, shredded, and sorted using mechanical processes.\nMetal recycling, especially of structural steel, ships, used manufactured goods, such as vehicles and white goods, is an industrial activity with complex networks of wrecking yards, sorting facilities, and recycling plants. The industry includes both formal organizations and a wide range of informal roles such as waste pickers who help sorting through scrap.\n\nProcessing\nScrap metal originates both in business and residential environments. Typically a \"scrapper\" will advertise their services to conveniently remove scrap metal for people who don't need it.\nScrap is often taken to a wrecking yard (also known as a scrapyard, junkyard, or breaker's yard), where it is processed for later melting into new products. A wrecking yard, depending on its location, may allow customers to browse their lot and purchase items before they are sent to the smelters, although many scrap yards that deal in large quantities of scrap usually do not, often selling entire units such as engines or machinery by weight with no regard to their functional status. Customers are typically required to supply all of their own tools and labor to extract parts, and some scrapyards may first require waiving liability for personal injury before entering. Many scrapyards also sell bulk metals (stainless steel, etc.) by weight, often at prices substantially below the retail purchasing costs of similar pieces.\nA scrap metal shredder is often used to recycle items containing a variety of other materials in combination with steel. Examples are automobiles and white goods such as refrigerators, stoves, clothes washers, etc. These items are labor-intensive to manually sort things like plastic, copper, aluminum, and brass. By shredding it into relatively small pieces, the steel can easily be separated out magnetically. The non-ferrous waste stream requires other techniques to sort.\nIn contrast to wrecking yards, scrapyards typically sell everything by weight, instead of by item. To the scrapyard, the primary value of the scrap is what the smelter will give them for it, rather than the value of whatever shape the metal may be in. An auto wrecker, on the other hand, would price exactly the same scrap based on what the item does, regardless of what it weighs. Typically, if a wrecker cannot sell something above the value of the metal in it, they would then take it to the scrapyard and sell it by weight. Equipment containing parts of various metals can often be purchased at a price below that of either of the metals, due to saving the scrapyard the labor of separating the metals before shipping them to be recycled.\n\nThieves sometimes sell stolen items to scrapyards. Copper pipes and wiring, bronze monuments and aluminium siding have all been targets of metal theft, with the number of thefts increasing as prices rise. Manhole covers have also been stolen. In the 1970s, the term \"newsjacking\" was coined to describe the theft of newspapers for sale to scrap dealers.\n\nResources\nScrap prices may vary markedly over time and in different locations. Prices are often negotiated between buyers and sellers directly or indirectly over the Internet. Prices displayed as the market prices are not the prices that recyclers will see at the scrap yards. Other prices are ranges or older and not updated frequently. Some scrap yards' websites have updated scrap prices.\nIn the US, scrap prices are reported in a handful of publications, including American Metal Market, based on confirmed sales as well as reference sites such as Scrap Metal Prices and Auctions. Non-US domiciled publications, such as The Steel Index, also report on the US scrap price, which has become increasingly important to global export markets. Scrap yards directories are also used by recyclers to find facilities in the US and Canada, allowing users to get in contact with yards.\nWith resources online for recyclers to look at for scrapping tips, like websites, blogs, and search engines, scrapping is often referred to as a hand and labor-intensive job. Taking apart and separating metals is important to making more money on scrap, tips like using a magnet to determine ferrous and non-ferrous materials can help recyclers make more money on their metal recycling. When a magnet sticks to the metal, it will be a ferrous material, like steel or iron. This is usually a less expensive item that is recycled but usually is recycled in larger quantities of thousands of pounds. Non-ferrous metals like copper, aluminum, and brass do not stick to a magnet. Some cheaper grades of stainless steel are magnetic, other grades are not. These items are higher priced commodities for metal recycling and are important to separate when recycling them. The prices of non-ferrous metals also tend to fluctuate more than ferrous metals so it is important for recyclers to pay attention to these sources and the overall markets.\n\nUrban mining\nThis term is used to describe the recovery of \"dormant\" materials that once served a purpose in society but have become disused since. For example, large amounts of metal are buried underground as part of the provision of basic services including telecoms. Infrastructure, buildings and equipment stored or lying dormant in this way accounted for 28% of Sweden's copper use in 2021. In the same period, one sixth of the cables installed in Sweden's telecoms came from harvesting via urban mining. In particular this involved copper, aluminium, iron and steel. Figures for this are issued by SGU, a Swedish government body responsible for geological survey of bedrock, soil and groundwater.\n\nHazards\nGreat potential exists in the scrap metal industry for accidents in which a hazardous material present in scrap causes death, injury, or environmental damage. A classic example is radioactivity in scrap; the Goiânia accident and the Mayapuri radiological accident were incidents involving radioactive materials. Toxic materials such as asbestos, and toxic metals such as beryllium, cadmium, lead and mercury may pose dangers to personnel, as well as contaminating materials intended for metal smelters.\nMany specialized tools used in scrapyards are hazardous, such as the alligator shear, which cuts metal using hydraulic force, compactors, scrap metal shredder, and vacuum.\n\nMetal recycling industry\nThe metal recycling industry encompasses a wide range of metals. The more frequently recycled metals are scrap steel, iron (ISS), lead, aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and zinc. Steel is the most recycled due to its sustainable properties. There are two main categories of metals: ferrous and non-ferrous. Metals that contain iron in them are known as ferrous.\nMetals without iron are non-ferrous.\n\nCommon non-ferrous metals are copper, brass, aluminum, zinc, magnesium, tin, nickel, and lead.\nUsable coins can be deposited in banks. Damaged US coins can be redeemed for money via the Mutilated Coin Redemption Program.\nNon-ferrous metals also include precious and exotic metals:\n\nPrecious metals are metals with a high market value in any form, such as gold, silver, and platinum group metals.\nExotic metals contain rare elements such as cobalt, mercury, titanium, tungsten, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cerium, cadmium, niobium, indium, gallium, germanium, lithium, selenium, tantalum, tellurium, vanadium, and zirconium. Some types of metals are radioactive. These may be \"naturally occurring\" or formed by nuclear reactions. Metals that have been exposed to radioactive sources may also become radioactive in settings such as medical environments, research laboratories, and nuclear power plants.\nOSHA guidelines should be followed when recycling any type of scrap metal to ensure safety.\n\nFerrous metal recycling\nFerrous metals are able to be recycled, with steel being one of the most recycled materials in the world. Ferrous metals contain an appreciable percentage of iron and the addition of carbon and other substances creates steel. Iron  is also commonly recycled, since it is a ferrous metal.\n\nDescription\nIn the United States, steel containers, cans, automobiles, appliances, and construction materials contribute the greatest weight of recycled materials. For example, in 2008, more than 97% of structural steel and 106% of automobiles were recycled, comparing the current steel consumption for each industry with the amount of recycled steel being produced (the late 2000s recession and the associated sharp decline in automobile production in the US explains the over-100% calculation). A typical appliance is about 75% steel by weight and automobiles are about 65% steel and iron.\nThe steel industry has been actively recycling for more than 150 years, in large part because it is economically advantageous to do so. It is cheaper to recycle steel than to mine iron ore and manipulate it through the production process to form new steel. Steel does not lose any of its inherent physical properties during the recycling process, and has drastically reduced energy and material requirements compared with refinement from iron ore. The energy saved by recycling reduces the annual energy consumption of the industry by about 75%, which is enough to power eighteen million homes for one year. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the per capita stock of steel in use in Australia, Canada, the European Union EU15, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, New Zealand, and the US combined is 7,085 kilograms (15,620 lb) (about 860 million people in 2005).\nBasic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) uses 25–35% recycled steel to make new steel. BOS steel usually contains lower concentrations of residual elements such as copper, nickel, and molybdenum, and is, therefore more malleable than electric arc furnace (EAF) steel, and is often used to make automotive fenders, tin cans, industrial drums, or any product with a large degree of cold working. EAF steelmaking uses almost 100% recycled steel. This steel contains greater concentrations of residual elements that cannot be removed through the application of oxygen and lime. It is used to make structural beams, plates, reinforcing bar, and other products that require little cold working. Downcycling of steel by hard-to-separate impurities such as copper or tin can only be prevented by well-aimed scrap selection or dilution by pure steel. Recycling one metric ton (1,000 kilograms) of steel saves 1.1 metric tons of iron ore, 630 kilograms of coal, and 55 kilograms of limestone.\n\nTypes of scrap used in steelmaking\nHeavy melting steel – Industrial or commercial scrap steel greater than 6 mm thick, such as plates, beams, columns, channels; may also include scrap machinery or implements or certain metal stampings\nOld car bodies – Vehicles with or without interiors and their original wheels\nCast iron – Cast iron bathtubs, machinery, pipe, and engine blocks\nPressing steel – Domestic scrap metal up to approx. 6 mm (0.24 in) thick. Examples – \"White goods\" (fridges, washing machines, etc.), roofing iron, water heaters, water tanks, and sheet metal offcuts\nReinforcing bars or mesh – Used in the construction industry within concrete structures\nTurnings – Remains of drilling or shaping steels. Also known as \"borings\" or \"swarf\"\nManganese steel – Non-magnetic, hardened steel used in the mining industry, cement mixers, rock crushers, and other high-impact and abrasive environments.\nRails – Rail or tram tracks\n\nShip breaking\nThe hulls of ships, with any usable equipment salvaged and removed, can be broken up to provide scrap steel. For a time countries in south Asia carried out most shipbreaking, often using manual methods that were hazardous to workers and the environment. International regulations now dictate the treatment of old ships as sources of hazardous waste, so shipbreaking has returned to ports in more developed countries. In 2013, about 29 million tons of scrap steel were recovered from broken ships. Some of the scrap can be reheated and rolled to make products such as concrete reinforcing bars, or the scrap may be melted to make new steel.\n\nEconomic role\nUnited States\nThe scrap industry was valued at more than $90 billion in 2012, up from $54 billion in 2009 balance of trade, exporting $28 billion in scrap commodities to 160 countries. Since 2010, the industry has added more than 15,000 jobs and supports 463,000 workers, both directly and indirectly. In addition, it generates more than $10 billion in revenue for federal, state, and local governments. Scrap recycling also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy and natural resources. For example, scrap recycling diverts 135 million short tons (121,000,000 long tons; 122,000,000 t) of materials away from landfills. Recycled scrap is a raw material feedstock for nearly 60% of steel made in the US, almost 50% of the copper and copper alloys produced in the US, more than 75% of the US paper industry's needs, and for 50% of US aluminum. Recycled scrap helps keep air and water cleaner by removing potentially hazardous materials and keeping them out of landfills.\n\nSee also\nAircraft boneyard\nAluminium recycling\nBritish Metals Recycling Association\nHeavy metals\nMetal prices\nMetal swarf\nParticulates\nRecycling by material\nSlag\nShip breaking\nVehicle recycling\nWrecking yard\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nScrap Buyers in Hyderabad, India\nSteel Recycling Institute – Steel Recycling Information, News, and Resources\nHow Scrap Is Recycled: Video[usurped]",

        "content": "Dizziness is an imprecise term that can refer to a sense of disorientation in space, vertigo, or lightheadedness. It can also refer to disequilibrium or a non-specific feeling, such as giddiness or foolishness.\nDizziness is a common medical complaint, affecting 20–30% of persons. Dizziness is broken down into four main subtypes: vertigo (~25–50%), disequilibrium (less than ~15%), presyncope (less than ~15%), and nonspecific dizziness (~10%).\n\nVertigo is the sensation of spinning or having one's surroundings spin about them. Many people find vertigo very disturbing and often report associated nausea and vomiting.\nPresyncope describes lightheadedness or feeling faint; the name relates to syncope, which is actually fainting.\nDisequilibrium is the sensation of being off balance and is most often characterized by frequent falls in a specific direction.  This condition is not often associated with nausea or vomiting.\nNon-specific dizziness such as persistent postural-perceptual dizziness may be psychiatric in origin.  It is a diagnosis of exclusion and can sometimes be brought about by hyperventilation.\n\nMechanism and causes\nMany conditions cause dizziness because multiple parts of the body are required for maintaining balance including the inner ear, eyes, muscles, skeleton, and the nervous system. Thus dizziness can be caused by a variety of problems and may reflect a focal process (such as one affecting balance or coordination) or a diffuse one (such as a toxic exposure or low perfusion state).\nCommon causes of dizziness include:\n\nInadequate blood supply to the brain due to:\nA sudden fall in blood pressure\nHeart problems or artery blockages\nAnaemias, such as vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, iron deficiency anemia\nLoss or distortion of vision or visual cues\nStanding too quickly/prolonged standing\nDisorders of the inner ear\nDehydration\nDistortion of brain/nervous function by medications such as anticonvulsants and sedatives\nDysfunction of cervical proprioception\nSide effects from other prescription drugs, such as proton-pump inhibitors or Coumadin (warfarin)\n\nDiagnosis\nDifferential diagnosis\nDizziness may occur from an abnormality involving the brain (in particular the brainstem or cerebellum), inner ear, eyes, heart, vascular system, fluid or blood volume, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, or body electrolytes. Dizziness can accompany certain serious events, such as a concussion or brain bleed, epilepsy and seizures (convulsions), stroke, and cases of meningitis and encephalitis. However, the most common subcategories can be broken down as follows: 40% peripheral vestibular dysfunction, 10% central nervous system lesion, 15% psychiatric disorder, 25% presyncope/disequilibrium, and 10% nonspecific dizziness. Some vestibular pathologies have symptoms that are comorbid with mental disorders.\nWhile traditional medical teaching has focused on determining the cause of dizziness based on the category (such as vertigo vs. presyncope),  research published in 2017 suggests that this analysis is of limited clinical utility.\nMedical conditions that often have dizziness as a symptom include:\n\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo\nMénière's disease\nLabyrinthitis\nOtitis media\nBrain tumor\nAcoustic neuroma\nMotion sickness\nRamsay Hunt syndrome\nFatal Familial Insomnia\nMigraine\nMultiple sclerosis\nPregnancy\nLow blood pressure (hypotension)\nLow blood oxygen content (hypoxemia)\nHeart attack\nIron deficiency (anemia)\nVitamin B12 deficiency\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\nHormonal changes (e.g. thyroid disease, menstruation, pregnancy)\nPanic disorder\nHyperventilation\nAnxiety\nDepression\nAge-diminished visual, balance, and perception of spatial orientation abilities\nStroke; cause of isolated dizziness in 0.7% of people who present to the emergency department\n\nDisequilibrium\nIn medicine, disequilibrium refers to impaired equilibrioception that can be characterised as a sensation of impending fall or of the need to obtain external assistance for proper locomotion. It is sometimes described as a feeling of improper tilt of the floor, or as a sense of floating. This sensation can originate in the inner ear or other motion sensors, or in the central nervous system. Neurologic disorders tend to cause constant vertigo or disequilibrium and usually have other symptoms of neurologic dysfunction associated with the vertigo. Many medications used to treat seizures, depression, anxiety, and pain affect the vestibular system and the central nervous system which can cause the symptom of disequilibrium.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nDizzytimes.com (Archived 2020-05-27 at the Wayback Machine)—Online community for people with vertigo and dizziness\nDysautonomia Youth Network of America, Inc.",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apply",
        "content": "In mathematics and computer science, apply is a function that applies a function to arguments. It is central to programming languages derived from lambda calculus, such as LISP and Scheme, and also in functional languages. It has a role in the study of the denotational semantics of computer programs, because it is a continuous function on complete partial orders. Apply is also a continuous function in homotopy theory, and, indeed underpins the entire theory: it allows a homotopy deformation to be viewed as a continuous path in the space of functions.  Likewise, valid mutations (refactorings) of computer programs can be seen as those that are \"continuous\" in the Scott topology.\nThe most general setting for apply is in category theory, where it is right adjoint to currying in closed monoidal categories. A special case of this are the Cartesian closed categories, whose internal language is simply typed lambda calculus.\n\nProgramming\nIn computer programming, apply applies a function to a list of arguments. Eval and apply are the two interdependent components of the eval-apply cycle, which is the essence of evaluating Lisp, described in SICP.  Function application corresponds to beta reduction in lambda calculus.\n\nApply function\nApply is also the name of a special function in many languages, which takes a function and a list, and uses the list as the function's own argument list, as if the function were called with the elements of the list as the arguments.  This is important in languages with variadic functions, because this is the only way to call a function with an indeterminate (at compile time) number of arguments.\n\nCommon Lisp and Scheme\nIn Common Lisp apply is a function that applies a function to a list of arguments (note here that \"+\" is a variadic function that takes any number of arguments):\n\nSimilarly in Scheme:\n\nC++\nIn C++, Bind  is used either via the std namespace or via the boost namespace.\n\nC# and Java\nIn C# and Java, variadic arguments are simply collected in an array. Caller can explicitly pass in an array in place of the variadic arguments. This can only be done for a variadic parameter. It is not possible to apply an array of arguments to non-variadic parameter without using reflection. An ambiguous case arises should the caller want to pass an array itself as one of the arguments rather than using the array as a list of arguments. In this case, the caller should cast the array to Object to prevent the compiler from using the apply interpretation.\n\nWith version 8 lambda expressions were introduced. Functions are implemented as objects with a functional interface, an interface with only one non-static method. The standard interface \n\nconsist of the method (plus some static utility functions):\n\nGo\nIn Go, typed variadic arguments are simply collected in a slice. The caller can explicitly pass in a slice in place of the variadic arguments, by appending a ... to the slice argument. This can only be done for a variadic parameter. The caller can not apply an array of arguments to non-variadic parameters, without using reflection..\n\nHaskell\nIn Haskell, functions may be applied by simple juxtaposition:\n\nIn Haskell, the syntax may also be interpreted that each parameter curries its function in turn. In the above example, \"func param1\" returns another function accepting one fewer parameters, that is then applied to param2, and so on, until the function has no more parameters.\n\nJavaScript\nIn JavaScript, function objects have an apply method, the first argument is the value of the this keyword inside the function; the second is the list of arguments:\n\nES6 adds the spread operator func(...args) which may be used instead of apply.\n\nLua\nIn Lua, apply can be written this way:\n\nPerl\nIn Perl, arrays, hashes and expressions are automatically \"flattened\" into a single list when evaluated in a list context, such as in the argument list of a function\n\nPHP\nIn PHP, apply is called call_user_func_array:\n\nPython and Ruby\nIn Python and Ruby, the same asterisk notation used in defining variadic functions is used for calling a function on a sequence and array respectively:\n\nPython originally had an apply function, but this was deprecated in favour of the asterisk in 2.3 and removed in 3.0.\n\nR\nIn R, do.call constructs and executes a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to it:\n\nSmalltalk\nIn Smalltalk, block (function) objects have a valueWithArguments: method which takes an array of arguments:\n\nTcl\nSince Tcl 8.5, a function can be applied to arguments with the apply command  where the function is a two element list {args body} or a three element list {args body namespace}.\n\nUniversal property\nConsider a function \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        :\n        (\n        X\n        ×\n        Y\n        )\n        →\n        Z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g:(X\\times Y)\\to Z}\n  \n, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        ∈\n        [\n        (\n        X\n        ×\n        Y\n        )\n        →\n        Z\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g\\in [(X\\times Y)\\to Z]}\n  \n where the bracket notation \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        A\n        →\n        B\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [A\\to B]}\n  \n denotes the space of functions from A to B.

In category theory, however, \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        A\n        →\n        B\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [A\\to B]}\n  \n is known as the exponential object, and is written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B^{A}}\n  \n. There are other common notational differences as well; for example Apply is often called Eval, even though in computer science, these are not the same thing, with eval distinguished from Apply, as being the evaluation of the quoted string form of a function with its arguments, rather than the application of a function to some arguments.\nAlso, in category theory, curry is commonly denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n, so that \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        g\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda g}\n  \n is written for curry(g).  This notation is in conflict with the use of \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n in lambda calculus, where lambda is used to denote bound variables. With all of these notational changes accounted for, the adjointness of Apply and curry is then expressed in the commuting diagram\n\nThe articles on exponential object and Cartesian closed category provide a more precise discussion of the category-theoretic formulation of this idea.  Thus the use of lambda here is not accidental; the internal language of Cartesian closed categories is simply-typed lambda calculus. The most general possible setting for Apply are the closed monoidal categories, of which the cartesian closed categories are an example. In homological algebra, the adjointness of curry and apply is known as tensor-hom adjunction.\n\nTopological properties\nIn order theory, in the category of complete partial orders endowed with the Scott topology, both curry and apply are continuous functions (that is, they are Scott continuous).  This property helps establish the foundational validity of the study of the denotational semantics of computer programs.\nIn algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, curry and apply are both continuous functions when the space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Y\n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y^{X}}\n  \n of continuous functions from \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n is given the compact open topology, and \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is locally compact Hausdorff. This result is very important, in that it underpins homotopy theory, allowing homotopic deformations to be understood as continuous paths in the space of functions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith",
        "content": "Faith is confidence or trust in a person, thing, or concept. In the context of religion, faith is \"belief in God or in the doctrines or teachings of religion\".\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, faith has multiple definitions, including \"something that is believed especially with strong conviction\", \"complete trust\", \"belief and trust in and loyalty to God\", as well as \"a firm belief in something for which there is no proof\".\nReligious people often think of faith as confidence based on a perceived degree of warrant, or evidence, while others who are more skeptical of religion tend to think of faith as simply belief without evidence.\nIn the Roman world, 'faith' (Latin: fides) was understood without particular association with gods or beliefs. Instead, it was understood as a paradoxical set of reciprocal ideas: voluntary will and voluntary restraint in the sense of father over family or host over guest, whereby one party willfully surrenders to a party who could harm but chooses not to, thereby entrusting or confiding in them.\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas, faith is \"an act of the intellect assenting to the truth at the command of the will\".\nReligion has a long tradition, since the ancient world, of analyzing divine questions using common human experiences such as sensation, reason, science, and history that do not rely on revelation—called Natural theology.\n\nEtymology\nThe English word faith finds its roots in the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *bheidh-, signifying concepts of trust, confidence, and persuasion. This root has given rise to various terms across different languages, such as Greek πίστις (pístis), meaning \"faith\", and Latin fidēs, meaning \"trust\", \"faith\", \"confidence\".\nFurthermore, the Proto-Indo-European root *were-o- adds another layer to the word's etymology, emphasizing the notions of truth and trustworthiness. This root is evident in English words like veracity, verity, and verify, as well as in Latin with verus, meaning \"true\".\nThe term faith in English emerged in the mid-13th century, evolving from Anglo-French and Old French forms like feid and feit, ultimately tracing back to the Latin fidēs. This Latin term, rooted in the PIE root *bheidh-, encompassed meanings such as trust, confidence, and belief.\n\nReligious faith\nExtent of religious faith\nReferring to \"religions\" (plural), Pope Francis claims that \"the majority of people living on our planet profess to be believers\".\n\nChristianity\nThe word translated as \"faith\" in English-language editions of the New Testament, the Greek word πίστις (pístis), can also be translated as \"belief\", \"faithfulness\", or \"trust\". Faith can also be translated from the Greek verb πιστεύω (pisteuo), meaning \"to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure\". Christianity encompasses various views regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true. In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. The 13th-century theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it represents a mean (understood in the Aristotelian sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.\nAccording to Teresa Morgan, faith was understood by early Christians within the cultural milieu of the period as a relationship that created a community based on trust, instead of a set of mental beliefs or feelings of the heart.\nNumerous commentators discuss the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in Jesus brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.\nRegardless of the approach taken to faith, all Christians agree that the Christian faith (in the sense of Christian practice) is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian contemplates the mystery of God and his grace and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, the faith is not static, but causes one to learn more of God and to grow in faith; Christian faith has its origin in God.\nIn Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not fideism or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements. Before Christians have faith, but they must also understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions, and on the personal experiences of the believer.\n\nStrength of faith\nChristians may recognize different degrees of faith when they encourage each other to, and themselves strive to, develop, grow, and/or deepen their faith.\nThis may imply that one can measure faith. Willingness to undergo martyrdom indicates a proxy for depth of faith but does not provide an everyday measurement for the average contemporary Christian. Within the Calvinist tradition the degree of prosperity may serve as an analog of the level of faith.\nOther Christian strands may rely on personal self-evaluation to measure the intensity of an individual's faith, with associated difficulties in calibrating to any scale. Solemn affirmations of a creed (a statement of faith) provide broad measurements of details. Various tribunals of the Inquisition, however, concerned themselves with precisely evaluating the orthodoxy of the faith of those it examined – to acquit or to punish in varying degrees.\nThe classification of different degrees of faith allows that faith and its expression may wax and wane in fervor—during the lifetime of a faithful individual and/or over the various historical centuries of a society with an embedded religious system. Thus, one can speak of an \"Age of Faith\"\nor of the \"decay\" of a society's religiosity into corruption,\nsecularism,\nor atheism,—interpretable as the ultimate loss of faith.\n\nChristian apologetic views\nIn contrast to Richard Dawkins' view of faith as \"blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence\", Alister McGrath quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\" and that it \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...\", which McGrath sees as \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith\".\nAmerican biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson (1863–1934) stated that the Greek word pistis used for \"faith\" in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31, is \"an old verb meaning 'to furnish', used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\" Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded\".\nBritish Christian apologist John Lennox argues that \"faith conceived as a belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as a belief that has warrant\". He states that \"the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind\". \"The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based.\" \"We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up.\" \"Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives.\"\nPeter S. Williams holds that \"the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence\". Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as \"a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true\".\nRegarding doubting Thomas in John 20:24–31, Williams points out that \"Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence\". He was asked to believe based on the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples... But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30–31.\"\nConcerning doubting Thomas, Michael R. Allen wrote: \"Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person qua person\".\nKenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to as evidentialism, and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called classical foundationalism, which is accompanied by deontologism, which holds that humans must regulate their beliefs following evidentialist structures. They show how this can go too far, and Alvin Plantinga deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.\"\n\nCatholicism\nThe four-part Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) gives Part One to \"The Profession of Faith\". This section describes the content of faith. It elaborates and expands, particularly upon the Apostles' Creed. CCC 144 initiates a section on the \"Obedience of Faith\".\nIn the theology of Pope John Paul II, faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of Jesus Christ.\n\nMethodism\nIn Methodism, faith plays an important role in justification, which occurs during the New Birth. The Emmanuel Association, a Methodist denomination in the conservative holiness movement, teaches:\n\nLiving faith is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8; Romans 4:16) imparted to the obedient heart through the Word of God (Romans 10:17), and the ministry of the Holy Ghost (Ephesians 2:18). This faith becomes effective as it is exercised by man with the aid of the Spirit, which aid is always assured when the heart has met the divine condition (Hebrews 5:9). Living faith is to be distinguished from intellectual confidence which may be in the possession of any unawakened soul (Romans 10:1–4).\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nThe Articles of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that \"faith in the Lord Jesus Christ\" is the first principle of the gospel.\nSome alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented by church founder Joseph Smith in a collection of sermons, which are now published as the Lectures on Faith.\n\nLecture 1 explains what faith is;\nLecture 2 describes how mankind comes to know about God;\nLectures 3 and 4 make clear the necessary and unchanging attributes of God;\nLecture 5 deals with the nature of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost;\nLecture 6 proclaims that the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things is a prerequisite to gaining faith in salvation;\nLecture 7 treats the fruits of faith—perspective, power, and eventually perfection.\n\nBuddhism\nFaith in Buddhism (saddhā, śraddhā) refers to a serene commitment to the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as Buddhas or bodhisattvas (those aiming to become a Buddha).: 388–89  Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.: 386, 396–7 \nIn early Buddhism, faith was focused on the Three Jewels or Refuges, namely, Gautama Buddha, his teaching (the Dhamma), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the Sangha). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to deities.: 74–5, 81  A faithful devotee was called upāsaka or upāsika, for which no formal declaration was required. In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason, or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority. As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to wisdom and enlightenment, and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.: 49–50 : 384, 396–7 \nWhile faith in Buddhism does not imply \"blind faith\", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of Gautama Buddha. Faith in Buddhism can still be described as faith in the Three Jewels (the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha). It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or bodhi, and Nirvana. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.\nIn the later stratum of Buddhist history, especially Mahāyāna Buddhism, faith was given a much more important role.: 172  The concept of the Buddha Nature was developed, as devotion to Buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in Pure Lands became commonplace. With the arising of the cult of the Lotus Sūtra, faith gained a central role in Buddhist practice, which was further amplified with the development of devotion to the Amitabha Buddha in Pure Land Buddhism.: 123  In the Japanese form of Pure Land Buddhism, under the teachers Hōnen and Shinran, only entrusting faith toward the Amitabha Buddha was believed to be a fruitful form of practice, as the practice of celibacy, morality, and other Buddhist disciplines were dismissed as no longer effective in this day and age, or as contradicting the virtue of faith.: 122–3 {{Harvey2013}} Faith was defined as a state similar to enlightenment, with a sense of self-negation and humility.\nThus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, Buddhist modernism in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia and the West but is understood and defined differently than in traditional interpretations.: 378, 429, 444  Within the Dalit Buddhist Movement communities, taking refuge is defined not only as a religious, but also a political choice.\n\nHinduism\nBhakti (Sanskrit: भक्ति) literally means \"attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity\". It was originally used in Hinduism, referring to devotion and love for a personal god or a representational god by a devotee. In ancient texts such as the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the term simply means participation, devotion, and love for any endeavor, while in the Bhagavad Gita, it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in bhakti marga.\nAhimsa, also referred to as nonviolence, is a fundamental tenet of Hinduism that advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.\nIn Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.\n\nIslam\nIn Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of Islam is called Iman (Arabic: الإيمان), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestioning or blind belief. A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty. According to the Quran, Iman must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into Paradise. In the Hadith of Gabriel, Iman in addition to Islam and Ihsan form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.\nMuhammad referred to the six axioms of faith in the Hadith of Gabriel: \"Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God].\" The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an. The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God. The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.\n\nJudaism\nJudaism recognizes the positive value of Emunah (generally translated as \"faith\", or \"trust in God\") and the negative status of the Apikorus (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in some other religions, especially Christianity or Islam. Faith could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true knowledge, true prophecy, and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed. Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of Christian faith, which is called Avodah Zarah (foreign worship) in Judaism, a minor form of idol worship, a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honor a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of Jewish principles of faith which are mandatory for all (observant) Jews.\nIn the Jewish scriptures, trust in God – Emunah – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the Torah, notably Deuteronomy 7:9:\n\nKnow therefore that the LORD thy God, He is God; the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations;\nThe specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, Orthodox Jews have accepted Maimonides's Thirteen Principles of Belief.\nA traditional example of Emunah as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of Abraham. On several occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible.\n\nThe Talmud describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, \"G‑d help me!\" The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d's will by stealing from others. For emunah to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation.\n\nSikhism\nFaith is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or Five Ks (in Punjabi known as pañj kakkē or pañj kakār), are sometimes referred to as the Five articles of Faith. The articles include kēs (uncut hair), kaṅghā (small wooden comb), kaṛā (circular steel or iron bracelet), kirpān (sword/dagger), and kacchera (special undergarment). Baptised Sikhs are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.\n\nBaháʼí Faith\nIn the Baháʼí Faith, faith is meant, first, as conscious knowledge, second, as the practice of good deeds, and ultimately as the acceptance of the divine authority of the Manifestations of God. In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth. Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.\n\nSecular faith\nSecular faith refers to a belief or conviction that is not based on religious or supernatural doctrines. Secular faith can arise from a wide range of sources and can take many forms, depending on the individual's beliefs and experiences, including:\n\nPhilosophy\nMany secular beliefs are rooted in philosophical ideas, such as humanism or rationalism. These belief systems often emphasize the importance of reason, ethics, and human agency, rather than relying on supernatural or religious explanations. A prime example is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, whose deontological ethical theory has profoundly shaped western secular values from the 18th century onward. He professed a secular faith in reason, writing in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals that \"the true vocation of reason must be to produce a will that is good, not perhaps as a means to other purposes, but good in itself, for which reason was absolutely necessary. This will need not, because of this, be the sole and complete good, but it must still be the highest good and the condition of every other, even of all demands for happiness.\"\nPersonal values and principles\nPeople may develop secular faith based on their own values and principles, such as a belief in social justice or environmentalism.\nCommunity and culture\nSecular faith can also be influenced by the values and beliefs of a particular community or culture. For example, some people may have faith in the principles of democracy, human rights, or freedom of expression.\n\nEpistemological analysis\nThe epistemological study focuses on epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. A justified belief is a belief that is well-supported by evidence and reasons, and that is arrived at through a reliable and trustworthy process of inquiry.\nFaith is often regarded as a form of belief that may not necessarily rely on empirical evidence. However, when religious faith does make empirical claims, these claims need to undergo scientific testing to determine their validity. On the other hand, some beliefs may not make empirical claims and instead focus on non-empirical issues such as ethics, morality, and spiritual practices. In these cases, it may be necessary to evaluate the validity of these beliefs based on their internal coherence and logical consistency, rather than empirical testing.\nThere is a wide spectrum of opinion concerning the epistemological validity of faith — that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.\n\nFideism\nFideism is considered to be a philosophical position rather than a comprehensive epistemological theory. It maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief but describes a particular philosophical proposition concerning the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid to late-19th century by way of Catholic thought, in a movement called Traditionalism. The Roman Catholic Magisterium has, however, repeatedly condemned fideism.\nCritics of fideism suggest that it is not a justified or rational position from an epistemological standpoint. Fideism holds that religious beliefs cannot be justified or evaluated based on evidence or reason and that faith alone is a sufficient basis for belief. This position has been criticized because it leads to dogmatism, irrationality, and a rejection of the importance of reason and evidence in understanding the world.\nWilliam Alston argues that while faith is an important aspect of religious belief, it must be grounded in reason and evidence to be justified.\n\nReligious epistemology\nReligious epistemologists formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument. Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American psychologist and philosopher William James offers a similar argument in his lecture The Will to Believe.\nFoundationalism is a view about the structure of justification or knowledge. Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and justified belief are ultimately based upon what are called properly basic beliefs. This position is intended to resolve the infinite regress problem in epistemology. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of reformed epistemology.\nReformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. Analytic philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff develop this view. Plantinga holds that a person may rationally believe in God even though the person does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the former requires defense against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant. Plantinga developed reformed epistemology in Warranted Christian Belief as a form of externalism that holds that the justification-conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.\nSome theistic philosophers have defended theism by granting evidentialism but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive or in the sense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by British philosopher Basil Mitchell and analytic philosopher Richard Swinburne, whose arguments are based on Bayesian probability. In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.\nProfessor of Mathematics and philosopher of science at University of Oxford John Lennox justifies his religious belief in Jesus's resurrection and miracles by believing God's capability of breaking the commonly recognized law of nature. John Lennox has stated, \"Faith is not a leap in the dark; it's the exact opposite. It's a commitment based on evidence… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.\" He criticises Richard Dawkins as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.\nCritics of reformed epistemology argue that it fails to provide a compelling justification for belief in God and that it is unable to account for the diversity of religious belief and experience. They also argue that it can lead to a kind of epistemic relativism, in which all religious beliefs are considered equally valid and justified, regardless of their content or coherence. Despite these criticisms, reformed epistemology has been influential in the contemporary philosophy of religion and continues to be an active area of debate and discussion.\n\nEmpirical claims\nMany religious beliefs are intended to be metaphorical or symbolic, but there are also religious beliefs that are taken quite literally by believers. For example, some Christians believe that the Earth was created in six literal days, and some Muslims believe that the Quran contains scientific facts that were not known to humans at the time of its revelation. Furthermore, even if a religious belief is intended to be metaphorical or symbolic, it can still be subject to empirical testing if it makes claims about the world. For example, the claim that the Earth is the center of the universe can be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of humanity's special place in the cosmos, but it also makes an empirical claim that can be tested by scientific observation.\n\nMorality and faith\nFrom a scientific perspective, morality is not dependent on faith. While some individuals may claim that their morality is rooted in their faith or religious beliefs, there is evidence to suggest that morality is also influenced by other factors, such as social and cultural norms, empathy, and reason. Studies have shown that individuals from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds tend to share many moral values, suggesting that morality is not solely dependent on faith. Additionally, research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology has shed light on the biological and cognitive mechanisms underlying moral decision-making, providing further evidence that morality is not exclusively dependent on faith.\n\nCriticism\nBertrand Russell wrote:\n\nChristians hold that their faith does good, but other faiths do harm. At any rate, they hold this about the communist faith. What I wish to maintain is that all faiths do harm. We may define \"faith\" as a firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of \"faith\". We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups substitute different emotions. Christians have faith in the Resurrection; communists have faith in Marx's Theory of Value. Neither faith can be defended rationally, and each therefore is defended by propaganda and, if necessary, by war.\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence. He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, cannot make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.\nPhilosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which \"claims about the world are likely true\". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives an example of the belief held by Muslims that Muhammad (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that Joseph Smith (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no \"built-in corrective mechanism\". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as \"belief without evidence\" or \"pretending to know things you don't know\".\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche expressed his criticism of the Christian idea of faith in passage 51 of The Antichrist: The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an idée fixe by no means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains, but instead raises them up where there were none before: all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic asylum. Not, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums. Christianity finds sickness necessary, just as the Greek spirit had need of a superabundance of health—the actual ulterior purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to make people ill. And the church itself—doesn't it set up a Catholic lunatic asylum as the ultimate ideal?—The whole earth as a madhouse?—The sort of religious man that the church wants is a typical décadent; the moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked by epidemics of nervous disorder; the \"inner world\" of the religious man is so much like the \"inner world\" of the overstrung and exhausted that it is difficult to distinguish between them; the \"highest\" states of mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are actually epileptoid in form—the church has granted the name of holy only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds in majorem dei honorem....\nGustave Le Bon emphasizes the irrational nature of faith and suggests that it is often based on emotions rather than reason. He argues that faith can be used to manipulate and control people, particularly in the context of religious or political movements. In this sense, Le Bon views faith as a tool that can be wielded by those in power to shape the beliefs and behaviors of the masses.\nFaith as in 'strong unshakable faith' is considered a virtue by many religious believers. This has been criticized since beliefs, including religious beliefs, should not be \"exempt from critical evaluation\" even if questioning or reconsidering these is difficult.\n\nSee also\nBlue skies research – Curiosity-driven scientific research, without a clear practical goal\nDelusion – Fixation of holding false beliefs\nDogma – Belief(s) accepted by members of a group without question\nFaith and rationality – Two approaches that exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility\nIncorrigibility – Property of a philosophical proposition\nLife stance – Person's relation with what they accept as being of ultimate importance\nMajor religious groups\nNuminous – Arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring\nPascal's wager – Argument for the belief in God\nPhilosophy of religion – Branch of philosophy\nPiety – Religious devotion or spirituality\nRationalism – Epistemological view centered on reason\nReligious conversion – Adoption of religious beliefs\nSaint Faith – Gallo-Roman saint\nSimple church – Private Christian gatheringPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nSpectrum of theistic probability – Way of categorizing one's belief regarding the probability of the existence of a deity\nTheological virtues – Christian ethics\nThere are no atheists in foxholes – Claim that high-stress situations prompt everyone to believe in god\nTruthiness – Quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes to be true, rather than actual truth\nWorldview – Fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nGupta, Nijay K.

        "content": "Meat is animal tissue, often muscle, that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted and farmed other animals for meat since prehistory. The Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of vertebrates, including chickens, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle, starting around 11,000 years ago. Since then, selective breeding has enabled farmers to produce meat with the qualities desired by producers and consumers.\nMeat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. Its quality is affected by many factors, including the genetics, health, and nutritional status of the animal involved. Without preservation, bacteria and fungi decompose and spoil unprocessed meat within hours or days. Meat is edible raw, but it is mostly eaten cooked, such as by stewing or roasting, or processed, such as by smoking or salting. \nThe consumption of meat (especially red and processed meat, as opposed to fish and poultry) increases the risk of certain negative health outcomes including cancer, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Meat production is a major contributor to environmental issues including global warming, pollution, and biodiversity loss, at local and global scales, but meat is important to economies and cultures around the world. Some people (vegetarians and vegans) choose not to eat meat for ethical, environmental, health or religious reasons.\n\nEtymology\nThe word meat comes from the Old English word mete, meaning food in general. In modern usage, meat primarily means skeletal muscle with its associated fat and connective tissue, but it can include offal, other edible organs such as liver and kidney. The term is sometimes used in a more restrictive sense to mean the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish, other seafood, insects, poultry, or other animals.\n\nHistory\nDomestication\nPaleontological evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of the earliest humans. Early hunter-gatherers depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as bison and deer. Animals were domesticated in the Neolithic, enabling the systematic production of meat and the breeding of animals to improve meat production.\n\nIntensive animal farming\nIn the postwar period, governments gave farmers guaranteed prices to increase animal production. The effect was to raise output at the cost of increased inputs such as of animal feed and veterinary medicines, as well as of animal disease and environmental pollution. In 1966, the United States, the United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, began factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs. Intensive animal farming became globalized in the later years of the 20th century, replacing traditional stock rearing in countries around the world. In 1990 intensive animal farming accounted for 30% of world meat production and by 2005, this had risen to 40%.\n\nSelective breeding\nModern agriculture employs techniques such as progeny testing to speed selective breeding, allowing the rapid acquisition of the qualities desired by meat producers. For instance, in the wake of well-publicized health concerns associated with saturated fats in the 1980s, the fat content of United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed methods of butchery.  Methods of genetic engineering that could improve the meat-producing qualities of animals are becoming available.\nMeat production continues to be shaped by the demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, better suited to producing such cuts.  Animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, including mammals such as antelope, zebra, water buffalo and camel,  as well as non-mammals, such as crocodile, emu and ostrich. Organic farming supports an increasing demand for meat produced to that standard.\n\nAnimal growth and development\nSeveral factors affect the growth and development of meat.\n\nGenetics\nSome economically important traits in meat animals are heritable to some degree, and can thus be selected for by animal breeding. In cattle, certain growth features are controlled by recessive genes which have not so far been excluded, complicating breeding. One such trait is dwarfism; another is the doppelender or \"double muscling\" condition, which causes muscle hypertrophy and thereby increases the animal's commercial value. Genetic analysis continues to reveal the mechanisms that control numerous aspects of the endocrine system and, through it, meat growth and quality.\nGenetic engineering can shorten breeding programs significantly because they allow for the identification and isolation of genes coding for desired traits, and for the reincorporation of these genes into the animal genome. To enable this, the genomes of many animals are being mapped. Some research has already seen commercial application. For instance, a recombinant bacterium has been developed which improves the digestion of grass in the rumen of cattle, and some features of muscle fibers have been genetically altered. Experimental reproductive cloning of commercially important meat animals such as sheep, pig or cattle has been successful. Asexual reproduction of animals bearing desirable traits is anticipated.\n\nEnvironment\nHeat regulation in livestock is of economic significance, as mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to delay it. Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one. Static magnetic fields, for reasons still unknown, retard animal development.\n\nAnimal nutrition\nThe quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal's plane of nutrition, i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcase composition.\nThe composition of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, is an important factor regulating animal growth. Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive, several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action.\nIn plant feed, environmental factors influence the availability of crucial nutrients or micronutrients, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments. In Australia, where the soil contains limited phosphate, cattle are fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency of beef production. Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism. Some man-made pollutants such as methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard as they bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.\n\nAnimal welfare\nPractices such as confinement in factory farming have generated concerns for animal welfare. Animals have abnormal behaviors such as tail-biting, cannibalism, and feather pecking. Invasive procedures such as beak trimming, castration, and ear notching have similarly been questioned. Breeding for high productivity may affect welfare, as when broiler chickens are bred to be very large and to grow rapidly. Broilers often have leg deformities and become lame, and many die from the stress of handling and transport.\n\nHuman intervention\nMeat producers may seek to improve the fertility of female animals through the administration of gonadotrophic or ovulation-inducing hormones. In pig production, sow infertility is a common problem – possibly due to excessive fatness. No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals. Artificial insemination is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females.\nGrowth hormones, particularly anabolic agents such as steroids, are used in some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals. This practice has given rise to the beef hormone controversy, an international trade dispute. It may decrease the tenderness of meat, although research on this is inconclusive, and have other effects on the composition of the muscle flesh. Where castration is used to improve control over male animals, its side effects can be counteracted by the administration of hormones. Myostatin has been used to produce muscle hypertrophy.\nSedatives may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and increase weight gain. The feeding of antibiotics to certain animals increases growth rates. This practice is particularly prevalent in the US, but has been banned in the EU, partly because it causes antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic microorganisms.\n\nComposition\nBiochemical\nThe biochemical composition of meat varies in complex ways depending on the species, breed, sex, age, plane of nutrition, training and exercise of the animal, as well as on the anatomical location of the musculature involved. Even between animals of the same litter and sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of intramuscular fat.\nAdult mammalian muscle consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent carbohydrates and 2.3 percent other soluble substances. These include organic compounds, especially amino acids, and inorganic substances such as minerals. Muscle proteins are either soluble in water (sarcoplasmic proteins, about 11.5 percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions (myofibrillar proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass). There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins. Most of them – the glycolytic enzymes – are involved in glycolysis, the conversion of sugars into high-energy molecules, especially adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, myosin and actin, form the muscle's overall structure and enable it to deliver power, consuming ATP in the process. The remaining protein mass includes connective tissue (collagen and elastin). Fat in meat can be either adipose tissue, used by the animal to store energy and consisting of \"true fats\" (esters of glycerol with fatty acids), or intramuscular fat, which contains phospholipids and cholesterol.\nMeat can be broadly classified as \"red\" or \"white\" depending on the concentration of myoglobin in muscle fiber. When myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, reddish oxymyoglobin develops, making myoglobin-rich meat appear red. The redness of meat depends on species, animal age, and fiber type: Red meat contains more narrow muscle fibers that tend to operate over long periods without rest, while white meat contains more broad fibers that tend to work in short fast bursts, such as the brief flight of the chicken. The meat of adult mammals such as cows, sheep, and horses is considered red, while chicken and turkey breast meat is considered white.\n\nNutritional\nMuscle tissue is high in protein, containing all of the essential amino acids, and in most cases is a good source of zinc, vitamin B12, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, vitamin B6, choline, riboflavin and iron. Several forms of meat are high in vitamin K. Muscle tissue is very low in carbohydrates and does not contain dietary fiber.\nThe fat content of meat varies widely with the species and breed of animal, the way in which the animal was raised, what it was fed, the part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild animals such as deer are leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for leaner meat. The fatty deposits near the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked, improve its flavor, and make the meat seem juicier. Fat around meat further contains cholesterol. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.\n\nProduction\nTransport\nUpon reaching a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported en masse to the slaughterhouse. Depending on its length and circumstances, this may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die en route. Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat. In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and glycogen, and their pH fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in poor meat quality.\n\nSlaughter\nAnimals are usually slaughtered by being first stunned and then exsanguinated (bled out). Death results from the one or the other procedure, depending on the methods employed. Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals with carbon dioxide, shooting them with a gun or a captive bolt pistol, or shocking them with electric current. The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the carotid artery and the jugular vein in cattle and sheep, and the anterior vena cava in pigs. Draining as much blood as possible from the carcass is necessary because blood causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms.\n\nDressing and cutting\nAfter exsanguination, the carcass is dressed; that is, the head, feet, hide (except hogs and some veal), excess fat, viscera and offal are removed, leaving only bones and edible muscle. Cattle and pig carcases, but not those of sheep, are then split in half along the mid ventral axis, and the carcase is cut into wholesale pieces. The dressing and cutting sequence, long a province of manual labor, is being progressively automated.\n\nConditioning\nUnder hygienic conditions and without other treatment, meat can be stored at above its freezing point (−1.5 °C) for about six weeks without spoilage, during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness and flavor. During the first day after death, glycolysis continues until the accumulation of lactic acid causes the pH to reach about 5.5. The remaining glycogen, about 18 g per kg, increases the water-holding capacity and tenderness of cooked meat.\nRigor mortis sets in a few hours after death as adenosine triphosphate is used up. This causes the muscle proteins actin and myosin to combine into rigid actomyosin. This in turn lowers the meat's water-holding capacity, so the meat loses water or \"weeps\". In muscles that enter rigor in a contracted position, actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that becomes tough when cooked. Over time, muscle proteins denature in varying degree, with the exception of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. These changes mean that meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor.\nAs the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidizes, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis contributes to conditioning: hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.\n\nAdditives\nWhen meat is industrially processed, additives are used to protect or modify its flavor or color, to improve its tenderness, juiciness or cohesiveness, or to aid with its preservation.\n\nConsumption\nHistorical\nA bioarchaeological (specifically, isotopic analysis) study of early medieval England found, based on the funerary record, that high-meat protein diets were extremely rare, and that (contrary to previously held assumptions) elites did not consume more meat than non-elites, and men did not consume more meat than women.\nIn the nineteenth century, meat consumption in Britain was the highest in Europe, exceeded only by that in British colonies. In the 1830s consumption per head in Britain was about 34 kilograms (75 lb) a year, rising to 59 kilograms (130 lb) in 1912. In 1904, laborers consumed 39 kilograms (87 lb) a year while aristocrats ate 140 kilograms (300 lb). There were some 43,000 butcher's shops in Britain in 1910, with \"possibly more money invested in the meat industry than in any other British business\" except finance.  The US was a meat importing country by 1926.\nTruncated lifespan as a result of intensive breeding allows more meat to be produced from fewer animals. The world cattle population was about 600 million in 1929, with 700 million sheep and goats and 300 million pigs.\n\nTrends\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the overall consumption for white meat has increased from the 20th to the 21st centuries. Poultry meat has increased by 76.6% per kilo per capita and pig meat by 19.7%. Bovine meat has decreased from 10.4 kg (22 lb 15 oz) per capita in 1990 to 9.6 kg (21 lb 3 oz) per capita in 2009. FAO analysis found that 357 million tonnes of meat were produced in 2021, 53% more than in 2000, with chicken meat representing more than half the increase.\nOverall, diets that include meat are the most common worldwide according to the results of a 2018 Ipsos MORI study of 16–64 years olds in 28 countries. Ipsos states \"An omnivorous diet is the most common diet globally, with non-meat diets (which can include fish) followed by over a tenth of the global population.\" Approximately 87% of people include meat in their diet in some frequency. 73% of meat eaters included it in their diet regularly and 14% consumed meat only occasionally or infrequently.\nThe type of meat consumed varies between different cultures. The amount and kind of meat consumed varies by income, both between countries and within a given country. Horses are commonly eaten in countries such as France, Italy, Germany and Japan. Horses and other large mammals such as reindeer were hunted during the late Paleolithic in western Europe. Dogs are consumed in China, South Korea and Vietnam. Dogs are occasionally eaten in the Arctic regions. Historically, dog meat has been consumed in various parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Japan, Switzerland and Mexico. Cats are sometimes eaten, such as in Peru. Guinea pigs are raised for their flesh in the Andes. Whales and dolphins are hunted, partly for their flesh, in several countries. Misidentification is a risk; in 2013, products in Europe labelled as beef actually contained horse meat.\n\nMethods of preparation\nMeat can be cooked in many ways, including braising, broiling, frying, grilling, and roasting. Meat can be cured by smoking, which preserves and flavors food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering wood. Other methods of curing include pickling, salting, and air-drying. Some recipes call for raw meat; steak tartare is made from minced raw beef. Pâtés are made with ground meat and fat, often including liver.\n\n\tTypes of meat and techniques used to prepare it\n\nHealth effects\nMeat, in particular red and processed meat, is linked to a variety of health risks. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans asked men and teenage boys to increase their consumption of vegetables or other underconsumed foods (fruits, whole grains, and dairy) while reducing intake of protein foods (meats, poultry, and eggs) that they currently overconsume.\n\nContamination\nToxic compounds including heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide residues, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyl can contaminate meat. Processed, smoked and cooked meat may contain carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Toxins may be introduced to meat as part of animal feed, as veterinary drug residues, or during processing and cooking. Such compounds are often metabolized in the body to form harmful by-products. Negative effects depend on the individual genome, diet, and history of the consumer.\n\nCancer\nThe consumption of processed and red meat carries an increased risk of cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialized agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), classified processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) as, \"carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer.\" IARC classified red meat as \"probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A), based on limited evidence that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in humans and strong mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect.\"\nCancer Research UK, National Health Service (NHS) and the National Cancer Institute have stated that red and processed meat intake increases risk of bowel cancer. The American Cancer Society in their \"Diet and Physical Activity Guideline\", stated \"evidence that red and processed meats increase cancer risk has existed for decades, and many health organizations recommend limiting or avoiding these foods.\" The Canadian Cancer Society have stated that \"eating red and processed meat increases cancer risk\".\nA 2021 review found an increase of 11–51% risk of multiple cancer per 100g/d increment of red meat, and an increase of 8–72% risk of multiple cancer per 50g/d increment of processed meat.\nCooking muscle meat creates heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute published results of a study which found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done. While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below 100 °C (212 °F) creates \"negligible amounts\" of HCAs. Microwaving meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%. Nitrosamines, present in processed and cooked foods, are carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, present in processed, smoked and cooked foods, are similarly carcinogenic.\n\nBacterial contamination\nBacterial contamination has been seen with meat products. A 2011 study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in U.S. grocery stores were contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics. A 2018 investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Guardian found that around 15 percent of the US population suffers from foodborne illnesses every year. The investigation highlighted unsanitary conditions in US-based meat plants, which included meat products covered in excrement and abscesses \"filled with pus\".\nComplete cooking and the careful avoidance of recontamination reduce the risk of bacterial infections from meat.\n\nDiabetes\nConsumption of 100 g/day of red meat and 50 g/day of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of diabetes.\nDiabetes UK advises people to limit their intake of red and processed meat.\n\nInfectious diseases\nMeat production and trade substantially increase risks for infectious diseases (zoonosis), including of pandemics, whether though contact with wild and farmed animals, or via husbandry's environmental impact. For example, avian influenza from poultry meat production is a threat to human health. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in meat production contributes to antimicrobial resistance – which contributes to millions of deaths – and makes it harder to control infectious diseases.\n\nChanges in consumer behavior\nIn response to changing meat prices as well as health concerns about saturated fat and cholesterol, consumers have altered their consumption of various meats. Consumption of beef in the United States between 1970 and 1974 and 1990–1994 dropped by 21%, while consumption of chicken increased by 90%.\n\nHeart disease\nExcept for poultry, at 50 g/day unprocessed red and processed meat are risk factors for ischemic heart disease, increasing the risk by about 9 and 18% respectively.\n\nEnvironmental impact\nA multitude of serious negative environmental effects are associated with meat production. Among these are greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, water use, water quality changes, and effects on grazed ecosystems. They are so significant that according to University of Oxford researchers, \"a vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth... far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car\". However, this is often ignored in the public consciousness and in plans to tackle serious environmental issues such as the climate crisis.\nThe livestock sector may be the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, pesticides), and it contributes to emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts for over 8% of global human water use. It is a significant driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystems, as it causes deforestation, ocean dead zones, species extinction, land degradation, pollution, overfishing and global warming. Cattle farming was estimated to be responsible for 80 per cent of Amazon deforestation in 2008 due to the clearing of forests to grow animal feed (especially soya) and cattle ranching.\nEnvironmental effects vary among livestock production systems. Grazing of livestock can be beneficial for some wildlife species, but not for others. Targeted grazing of livestock is used as a food-producing alternative to herbicide use in some vegetation management.\n\nLand use\nMeat production is by far the biggest user of land, as it accounts for nearly 40% of the global land surface. Just in the contiguous United States, 34% of its land area (265 million hectares or 654 million acres) are used as pasture and rangeland, mostly feeding livestock, not counting 158 million hectares (391 million acres) of cropland (20%), some of which is used for producing feed for livestock. Roughly 75% of deforested land around the globe is used for livestock pasture. Deforestation from practices like slash-and-burn releases CO2 and removes the carbon sink of grown tropical forest ecosystems which substantially mitigate climate change. Land use is a major pressure on pressure on fertile soils which is important for global food security.\n\nClimate change\nThe rising global consumption of carbon-intensive meat products has \"exploded the global carbon footprint of agriculture,\" according to some top scientists. Meat production is responsible for some 35% of global emissions of greenhouse gases, and 60% of the greenhouse gases attributable to food production.\nSome nations show very different impacts to counterparts within the same group, with Brazil and Australia having emissions over 200% higher than the average of their respective income groups, driven by meat consumption.\nAccording to the Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production report produced by United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) international panel for sustainable resource management, a worldwide transition in the direction of a meat and dairy free diet is indispensable if adverse global climate change were to be prevented. A 2019 report in The Lancet recommended that global meat (and sugar) consumption be reduced by 50 percent to mitigate climate change. Meat consumption in Western societies needs to be reduced by up to 90% according to a 2018 study published in Nature. The 2019 special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for significantly reducing meat consumption, particularly in wealthy countries, in order to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nBiodiversity loss\nMeat consumption is a primary contributor to the sixth mass extinction. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of global biodiversity loss is attributable to meat-based diets, in particular from the use of land for feed crops, resulting in large-scale loss of habitats and species. Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for a drastic reduction in per capita consumption of meat and \"dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods\". The 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services recommended a reduction in meat consumption to mitigate biodiversity loss. A 2021 Chatham House report asserted that a shift towards plant-based diets would free up land for the restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.\nMeat consumption is predicted to rise as the human population increases and becomes more affluent; this in turn would increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity.\n\nReducing environmental impact\nThe environmental impact of meat production can be reduced on the farm by conversion of human-inedible residues of food crops. Manure from meat-producing livestock is used as fertilizer. Substitution of animal manures for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 MJ of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.\n\nReducing meat consumption\nThe IPCC and others have stated that meat production has to be reduced substantially for any sufficient mitigation of climate change and, at least initially, largely through shifts towards plant-based diets where meat consumption is high. Personal carbon allowances that allow a certain amount of free meat consumption per person would be a form of restriction, meat taxes would be a type of fiscal mechanism. Meat can be replaced by, for example, high-protein iron-rich low-emission legumes and common fungi, dietary supplements (e.g. of vitamin B12) and fortified foods, cultured meat, microbial foods, mycoprotein, meat substitutes, and other alternatives, such as those based on mushrooms, legumes (pulses), and other food sources. Land previously used for meat production can be rewilded. The biologists Rodolfo Dirzo, Gerardo Ceballos, and Paul R. Ehrlich state that it is the \"massive planetary monopoly of industrial meat production that needs to be curbed\" while respecting the cultural traditions of indigenous peoples, for whom meat is an important source of protein.\n\nCultural aspects\nMeat is part of the human diet in most cultures, where it often has symbolic meaning and important social functions. Some people choose not to eat meat (vegetarianism) or any food made from animals (veganism). The reasons for not eating all or some meat may include ethical objections to killing animals for food, health concerns, environmental concerns or religious dietary laws.\n\nEthical issues\nEthical issues regarding the consumption of meat include objecting to the act of killing animals or to the agricultural practices used in meat production. Reasons for objecting to killing animals for consumption may include animal rights, environmental ethics, or an aversion to inflicting pain or harm on sentient animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals for cultural or religious reasons.\nThe founders of Western philosophy disagreed about the ethics of eating meat. Plato's Republic has Socrates describe the ideal state as vegetarian. Pythagoras believed that humans and animals were equal and therefore disapproved of meat consumption, as did Plutarch, whereas Zeno and Epicurus were vegetarian but allowed meat-eating in their philosophy. Conversely, Aristotle's Politics assert that animals, as inferior beings, exist to serve humans, including as food. Augustine drew on Aristotle to argue that the universe's natural hierarchy allows humans to eat animals, and animals to eat plants. Enlightenment philosophers were likewise divided. Descartes wrote that animals were merely animated machines, while Kant considered them inferior beings for lack of discernment: means rather than ends. But Voltaire and Rousseau disagreed; Rousseau argued that meat-eating is a social rather than a natural act, because children are not interested in meat.\nLater philosophers examined the changing practices of eating meat in the modern age as part of a process of detachment from animals as living beings. Norbert Elias, for instance, noted that in medieval times cooked animals were brought to the table whole, but that since the Renaissance only the edible parts are served, which are no longer recognizably part of an animal. Modern eaters, according to Noëlie Vialles, demand an \"ellipsis\" between meat and dead animals. Fernand Braudel wrote that since the European diet of the 15th and 16th century was particularly heavy in meat, European colonialism helped export meat-eating across the globe, as colonized peoples took up the culinary habits of their colonizers.\n\nReligious traditions\nAmong the Indian religions, Jainism opposes the eating of meat, while some schools of Buddhism and Hinduism advocate but do not mandate vegetarianism. Some Sikh groups oppose eating any meat. Jewish Kashrut dietary rules allow certain (kosher) meat and forbid other (treif) meat. Similar rules apply in Islamic dietary laws: The Quran explicitly forbids meat from animals that die naturally, blood, and the meat of pigs, which are haram, forbidden, as opposed to halal, allowed.\n\nPsychology\nResearch in applied psychology has investigated meat eating in relation to morality, emotions, cognition, and personality. Psychological research suggests meat eating is correlated with masculinity,  and reduced openness to experience. Research into the consumer psychology of meat is relevant both to meat industry marketing and to those advocating eating less meat.\n\nGender\nUnlike most other foods, meat is not perceived as gender-neutral; it is associated with men and masculinity. Sociological research, ranging from African tribal societies to contemporary barbecue, indicates that men are much more likely to participate in preparing meat than other food. This has been attributed to the influence of traditional male gender roles, in view of what Jack Goody calls a \"male familiarity with killing\", or as Claude Lévi-Strauss suggests, that roasting (meat) is more violent than boiling (grains and vegetables). In modern societies, men tend to consume more meat than women, and men often prefer red meat whereas women tend to prefer chicken and fish.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nSources\nThis article incorporates text from a free content work.

        "content": "Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg ( SHEL-burg, Swedish: [ˈfěːlɪks ˈǎrːvɪd ɵlf ˈɕɛ̂lːbærj] ; born 24 October 1989), better known as PewDiePie ( PEW-dee-py), is a Swedish YouTuber, best known for his gaming videos. Kjellberg's popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and content creators. Media coverage of him has cited him as a figurehead for YouTube, especially in the gaming genre.\nBorn and raised in Gothenburg, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel \"PewDiePie\" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel gained a substantial following and was one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, before becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg's channel was also the most-viewed on the platform. During this period, his content shifted focus from Let's Plays and diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.\nKjellberg's content was already noted for its polarizing reception among general audiences online, but in the late 2010s, it became more controversial and attracted increased media scrutiny. In 2019, following a public competition with Indian record label T-Series, Kjellberg was overtaken as the most-subscribed YouTube channel. Kjellberg later became more reserved online, uploading less consistently and taking frequent breaks from Internet use. He eventually semi-retired from YouTube, choosing to upload less frequently for his enjoyment rather than as a career. Meanwhile, in his personal life, he moved to Japan with his wife, Italian Internet personality Marzia.\nWith over 110 million subscribers and 29.4 billion views, his channel still ranks as one of the most-subscribed and viewed on YouTube. His popularity online has been noted to boost sales for the video games he plays, and has allowed him to stir support for charity fundraising drives. In 2016, Time magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\nEarly life and education\nFelix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, where he was also raised. He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (née Hellstrand, born 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 1957), and grew up with his older sister, Fanny. His mother, a former chief information officer (CIO), was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden. His father is a corporate executive.\n\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as play video games on his Super Nintendo Entertainment System, such as Star Fox and Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest. During high school, he frequently played video games in his bedroom and would skip classes to join at an Internet café with friends. During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with the money he made selling artwork through his grandmother's gallery.\nKjellberg then went on to pursue a degree in industrial engineering and management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, but left the university in 2011. While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career, Kjellberg clarified in 2017 that he had left due to a lack of interest in his course of study. He further expressed that, in general, leaving university to pursue a YouTube career would be \"fucking stupid\".\nKjellberg has also discussed an enjoyment of Adobe Photoshop, wanting to work on photo manipulation art using the program rather than be in school. Following this passion after he departed from Chalmers, he entered Photoshop contests and almost earned an apprenticeship at a prominent Scandinavian advertising agency. He was also interested in creating content on YouTube; after not earning the apprenticeship, he sold limited edition prints of his photoshopped images to purchase a computer to work on YouTube videos.\n\nInternet career\n2010–2012: early years\nKjellberg originally registered a YouTube account under the name \"Pewdie\" in December 2006; he explained that \"pew\" represents the sound of lasers and \"die\" refers to dying. After initially forgetting the password to this account, he registered the \"PewDiePie\" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. Following his exit from Chalmers, his parents refused to financially support him, so he funded his early videos by working as a harbor captain, selling prints of his Photoshop art, and working at a hot dog stand. Kjellberg stated that the ability to make videos was more important to him than a prestigious career. Five years later, Kjellberg recalled, \"I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn't know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do.\"\nIn his early years as a YouTube creator, Kjellberg focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games. Some of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including Minecraft and Call of Duty, although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and its related mods. On these videos, Kjellberg has stated \"I was so shy back then,\" and added, \"It was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone. That was unheard of back at the time. No one really did it.\" Kjellberg's oldest video available for viewing is titled \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\". Uploaded on 2 October 2010, the video is noted for containing mainly Swedish commentary from Kjellberg, rather than the English language he would later employ in his videos. The video has amassed over 21 million video views as of August 2022.\nStarting on 2 September 2011, he also began posting weekly vlogs under the title of Fridays with PewDiePie. The series was a weekly deviation from the Let's Play videos that formed most of his content output at the time, and often featured vlogs, and Kjellberg completing viewer requests.\n\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers, before rapidly increasing in 2012. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, Kjellberg spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. July 2012 saw his channel reaching 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked Kjellberg's channel as the No. 1 YouTube channel. Kjellberg signed with Maker Studios in December, a multi-channel network (MCN) that drives the growth of the channels under it. Prior to his partnership with Maker, he was signed to Machinima, which operates as a rival to Maker. Kjellberg expressed feeling neglected by Machinima, and frustrated with their treatment; he hired a lawyer to free him from his contract with the network.\nEarly in his YouTube career, Kjellberg used jokes about rape in his videos. A satirical video, created by Let's Play YouTuber Michael \"Slowbeef\" Sawyer, mocking Kjellberg's content highlighted his usage of such jokes. Shortly after, Kjellberg attracted criticism and controversy for the jokes, and in October 2012, he addressed the issue through a Tumblr post, writing, \"I just wanted to make clear that I'm no longer making rape jokes, as I mentioned before I'm not looking to hurt anyone and I apologise if it ever did.\" The Globe and Mail stated \"unlike many young gamers, he listened when fans and critics alike pointed out their harmful nature, and resolved to stop making rape jokes.\"\n\n2013–2014: becoming the most-subscribed user and continued growth\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers. In April, he was covered in The New York Times after surpassing 6 million subscribers. In May 2013, at the inaugural Starcount Social Stars Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg won the award for \"Swedish Social Star\". Nominated alongside Jenna Marbles, Smosh, and Toby Turner, he won the award for \"Most Popular Social Show\". In July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most-subscribed YouTube user, and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July 2013. In August, Kjellberg signed with Maker's gaming sub-network, Polaris. Polaris functioned as a relaunching of The Game Station, Maker's gaming network.\nKjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August. Kjellberg received a certificate from Guinness World Records for becoming the most subscribed YouTuber. In November, YouTube's Spotlight channel overtook Kjellberg's as the most-subscribed. Later in the month, Kjellberg proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system, and disabled the comment section on all of his videos. On 23 December 2013, his channel overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel, to once again become the most-subscribed on YouTube. Throughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained. Billboard reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's commentaries, originally best known for featuring horror video games, began to feature games that interested him regardless of genre. Kotaku wrote: \"Instead of limiting himself to horror games, Pewdiepie is now actively playing more things that interest him.\"\n\nIn March 2014, he updated his video production output, announcing he would be scaling down the frequency of uploads. In August 2014, Maker Studios released an official PewDiePie app for the iPhone, allowing audiences to view his videos, create custom favourite video feeds, and share videos with others. Later in the month, Kjellberg uploaded a video, announcing he would permanently disable comments on his YouTube videos. He cited most comments being spam and self-advertising and was not what he wanted to see. After disabling comments, Kjellberg continued interacting with his audience through Twitter and Reddit. \nOn 13 October, he decided to allow comments on his videos once more, albeit only after approval. However, he expressed that he toggled his comment settings this way so that he could redirect viewers to instead comment on the forums of his Broarmy.net website. He stated in a later video that disabling comments made him happier. In the same year, Kjellberg began streaming videos of his co-hosted series, BroKen, onto MLG.tv. He co-hosted the series with Kenneth Morrison, better known as CinnamonToastKen, who is also a video game commentator.\nIn October 2014, Kjellberg hinted at the possibility that he would not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014. He had expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney. Kjellberg mulled the option of launching his own network. However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, he tweeted, \"I feel like I was misquoted in The WSJ, and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me.\" Kjellberg ultimately continued creating videos under Maker. His relationship with Maker saw the network launch an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell merchandise, while Kjellberg promoted Maker's media interests, and gave the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.\nIn 2014 alone, Kjellberg's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers, and over 4.1 billion total views. Both figures were higher than any other user. According to Social Blade, Kjellberg's channel became the most-viewed channel on the website on 29 December 2014, having amassed over 7 billion views by that date.\n\n2015–2017: YouTube Red, Revelmode, and style change\nThe New York Times retrospectively noted that around 2015, Kjellberg's video content experienced a change in style: \"He began to take more risks. He continued playing video games, but he started experimenting. He did viral challenges, made fun of other YouTubers, and reviewed meme submissions from his fans.\" Kjellberg has attributed his content around this time as a result of immaturity, boredom with playing video games, YouTube's platform incentives, and the belief that his channel's growth had plateaued. One video cited as being representative of this change featured Kjellberg reading erotic fan fiction about characters from the Disney film Frozen. Then-CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger was reportedly angered by the video, putting Kjellberg's deal with Maker Studios, a Disney subsidiary, in jeopardy.\nOn 6 September 2015, his YouTube account became the first to surpass 10 billion video views. Later in the month, Kjellberg teased about having a role in a web television series, stating that he was in Los Angeles for the show's shooting. Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced that the series would be an original YouTube Red series, titled Scare PewDiePie. The series premiered the following February.\nIn January 2016, Kjellberg announced a partnership with Maker Studios to produce Revelmode, a sub-network of Maker, that would showcase Kjellberg and his friends on YouTube in original series. After the deal, the head of Maker Studios, Courtney Holt, stated, \"we're thrilled to be doubling down with Felix.\" Along with Kjellberg, eight other YouTubers signed to the network upon its creation: CinnamonToastKen, Marzia, Dodger, Emma Blackery, Jacksepticeye, Jelly, Kwebbelkop, and Markiplier. Three YouTubers – Cryaotic, KickThePJ, and Slogoman – would later join the sub-network after its launch.\nThroughout 2016, Kjellberg's video style change became more apparent. While producing fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour changed; he commented that he had shifted to drier humour, which was often not understood by younger viewers. He examined his older videos, and while noting the stylistic changes he had undergone, he expressed specific regret for his casual use of words like gay or retarded in a derogatory sense. In December 2016, Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that \"over the last year, the PewDiePie channel has also had an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself from many of the things that made him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like Amnesia,\" and adding, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"\nOn 2 December 2016, he uploaded a video discussing his frustration with the issue of YouTube accounts experiencing an unexplained loss of subscribers and views. Kjellberg stated that many people working with YouTube \"have no idea of the struggles that came with being a content creator.\" A Google representative issued a statement to Ars Technica, stating that no decreases in subscriber numbers were out of the ordinary. Kjellberg's video was uploaded as his channel approached 50 million subscribers, and he stated he would delete his channel once it reached the milestone. On 8 December, his channel reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so. He shortly thereafter received a custom Play Button from YouTube as a reward for reaching this milestone. Ultimately, Kjellberg did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead deleted a smaller second channel he had then-recently created. His threat to quit was also reported to be \"in fact, a promotional stunt\" for Scare PewDiePie.\nKjellberg nevertheless continued to express discontent with the platform, aiming further criticism at YouTube's changing algorithm negatively affecting viewership for content creators. The site's algorithm began to focus on watch time statistics and \"favor videos that drew daily viewers, higher engagement (more likes and comments) and cleaner 'ad-friendly' fare.\" Kjellberg later recounted to The New York Times that the platform's boundaries were widely unknown to creators. He responded to the algorithm changes by uploading vlogs that \"mixed earnest schmaltz [...] with inanity.\" Additionally, he \"enjoyed wading into the meme culture and edgelord humor that accompanied Donald Trump's ascent\". \nDuring this late 2016 and early 2017 period Kjellberg uploaded a string of videos addressing what Kjellberg saw as negative effects to content creator viewership caused by the new algorithm. As a satirical knock on the changing algorithms, Kjellberg made several videos asking viewers to help the video reach specific engagement milestones such as one million likes, dislikes, and comments. The videos were successful, promptly achieving the goal Kjellberg requested from viewers; the dislike video accumulated over 5 million dislikes before YouTube made such figures private in November 2021, becoming one of the most-disliked on the entire platform.\n\n2017–2018: media controversies, streaming, and formatted shows\nIn a video posted in January 2017, Kjellberg featured two paid individuals on Fiverr, asked to hold a sign that read \"Death to all Jews\". He alleged his intent was not against Jews, but to showcase how \"crazy\" the modern world and website were. The video received negative attention and caused a media backlash, with various publications writing critically of Kjellberg's defense of his controversial content as jokes taken out of context, and opining that his content helps normalise ideologies such as fascism, neo-Nazism, and white supremacy. \nThe Wall Street Journal alleged that this was not the first time Kjellberg had used antisemitic language and imagery in his videos. Kjellberg and the two individuals later apologised, but the event led Maker Studios to cut their ties with Kjellberg and Google to drop him from the Google Preferred advertising program and cancel the upcoming second season of the Scare PewDiePie YouTube Red series. Ultimately, Kjellberg apologised, but strongly rebuked media coverage of the event, with particular criticism aimed at The Wall Street Journal for how their reporting portrayed references to Nazis in some of his videos. The Wall Street Journal response referred to another video with a YouTuber going by the name Jesus Christ, stating \"Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong,\" as well as Kjellberg's response to the Fiverr suspension of the Jesus Christ account. \nAccording to Social Blade, his channel's total view count was surpassed by the Indian record label T-Series at the top of YouTube's view rankings on 14 February.\nIn April, while still continuing to upload new content onto YouTube, Kjellberg created Netglow, a crowdsourced channel on the livestreaming service Twitch. On Netglow, he started streaming Best Club, a weekly live stream show. Best Club premiered on 9 April, with its first episode featuring Brad Smith alongside Kjellberg. Kjellberg commented that his decision to create Netglow was in the works prior to the aforementioned allegations of antisemitic themes in his videos. Business Insider detailed that Kjellberg's first stream amassed around 60,000 viewers, and that Netglow had accumulated 93,000 subscribers to that point.\nIn September, while Kjellberg was live-streaming gameplay of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds to his YouTube channel, he used the ethnic slur \"nigger\" towards another player in the game. The video clip of the incident quickly went viral despite Kjellberg deleting it, and garnered widespread criticism across the internet. Kjellberg later apologised for the incident in a short video uploaded to his YouTube channel.  As a response to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to Kjellberg as \"worse than a closeted racist\", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against Kjellberg's videos featuring the studio's game Firewatch, and encouraged other game developers to do the same. Amidst the controversy stirred up by the incident, it was brought to light that Kjellberg was following several prominent far-right and white supremacist figures on Twitter, such as Stefan Molyneux, Carl Benjamin and Lauren Southern. He later deactivated his Twitter account and unfollowed everyone he was previously following, stating \"What I don't like is the constant posturing that goes on there. People just can't seem to help themselves from pointing out what is good and what is bad, or how others are bad and you are good.\"\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of The Guardian wrote about Kjellberg's YouTube content; he noted that each week Kjellberg posted videos featuring one of three series formats, comparing this uploading pattern to television programming. The three series listed were You Laugh You Lose, which features Kjellberg watching humorous video clips while trying to not laugh; Last Week I Asked You (LWIAY), having begun as a parody and homage to Jack Douglass' Yesterday I Asked You (YIAY), where he challenges his audience to create content and reviews the output; and Meme Review, in which he reviews popular Internet memes. Kjellberg began a book club-styled series, with his own enjoyment with the series also being noted. Kjellberg began Pew News, a satirical series where he presents and discusses recent news stories while in-character, often as fictional characters named after CNN hosts, such as Gloria Borger, Poppy Harlow, or Mary Katharine Ham and sometimes, an amalgamation of these names. Pew News parodies both mainstream news channels, such as CNN, and YouTube news channels, such as DramaAlert. Topics covered by Kjellberg on Pew News included culture war topics he previously avoided.\nIn May 2018, Kjellberg attracted controversy for using the term \"Twitch thots\" in a video that featured him watching a compilation of female Twitch streamers. Alinity, a streamer featured in the video, responded by making a copyright claim against his video, which she stated was later removed by CollabDRM, a company that strikes videos on behalf of creators. Alinity stated that her reaction was caused by \"the rampant sexism in online communities\", arguing that Kjellberg's comments degraded women; she refused to accept Kjellberg's apology. In July, Kjellberg posted a meme with singer Demi Lovato's face; the meme jokingly referenced Lovato's struggles with addiction. The meme was posted around the same time Lovato was hospitalized after suffering an opioid overdose. As a result, he received criticism from online users. Kjellberg later deleted the meme, and apologized for the incident.\nIn a video uploaded in early December, Kjellberg promoted several small content creators on YouTube, recommending his viewers to subscribe to them. Among those creators was \"E;R\", whom Kjellberg highlighted for a video essay on Netflix's Death Note. Shortly thereafter, The Verge's Julia Alexander noted that the video in question used imagery of the Charlottesville car attack to joke about the murder of Heather Hyer, and that E;R's channel included frequent use of racist, sexist, anti-semitic, and homophobic content.  In December 2018, Vox reported that \"E;R\" also contained white supremacist messaging. After online criticism, he described his posting as an \"oopsie\" and asserted that he had posted it \"recommending someone for their anime review\", rather than any intention to promote antisemitism. Kjellberg said he was largely unaware of E;R's content apart from the Death Note video essay, revoked his recommendation of the channel, and edited his video to remove the reference.\nOn 27 December 2018, Kjellberg uploaded \"YouTube Rewind 2018 but it's actually good\", in response to the generally negatively-received YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind, which was originally uploaded by YouTube's Spotlight channel.\n\n2018–2019: subscriber competition with T-Series\nIn September 2018, Kjellberg uploaded a LWIAY video discussing Indian record label T-Series' YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers. On 5 October, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track against the label titled \"Tseries Diss Track\", stylized in all caps and later renamed \"Bitch Lasagna\" in response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers. The video went on to replace \"A Funny Montage\" as Kjellberg's most-viewed video. It included some lines mocking the Indian background of T-Series, which were described as racist in media publications. On the prospect of being surpassed by T-Series in terms of subscriber count, he stated he was not concerned about T-Series, but feared the consequences a corporate channel surpassing him would have for YouTube as a video-sharing platform. Online campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.\nOn 12 March, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his show Pew News in which he mentioned the 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack, where 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed by a member of a Pakistan-based jihadist group. Following the attack, T-Series removed several songs by Pakistani artists on its YouTube channel after being pressurised by political party MNS to isolate Pakistani artists, a course of action that Kjellberg disagreed with. The outlet Zee News reported that Kjellberg \"faced strong criticism for his comments on the heightened tension between Pakistan and India in [the] March 12 issue of Pew News\". Kjellberg issued a clarification on Twitter, expressing that he was not attempting to speak on the broader India–Pakistan relations, but rather on the more specific context of T-Series removing artists' songs from its YouTube channel.\nOn 15 March, the perpetrator of the live-streamed Christchurch mosque shootings said \"remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie\" before carrying out the attacks. In response, Kjellberg tweeted his disgust after having his name associated with the attack, and offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy. Various journalists covering the shooting reported that Kjellberg was not complicit with the shootings. The New York Times suggested that Kjellberg's mention in the shootings was a ploy for the news media to attribute blame to Kjellberg, and to otherwise inflame political tensions.\nAfter briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube. On 31 March, Kjellberg posted another diss track music video, titled \"Congratulations\", sarcastically congratulating T-Series for obtaining the title. In the music video, Kjellberg mocked T-Series and its actions, alleging T-Series was founded to sell pirated songs and mocking them for sending him a cease and desist letter after \"Bitch Lasagna\". Following the video's release, Kjellberg temporarily regained the most-subscribed position over T-Series.\nOn 9 April, Kjellberg announced that he would live-stream exclusively on streaming service DLive, as part of a deal with the company.\nOn 11 April, T-Series started to seek court orders to remove Kjellberg's \"diss tracks\" from YouTube. The alleged court order was ruled in favor of T-Series. It was allegedly stated that the complaint against Kjellberg claimed that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive\", and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\" Access to the music videos on YouTube was later blocked in India. The two parties were reported to have come to a settlement later that July, although Kjellberg's videos remained blocked in India.\nOn 28 April, Kjellberg uploaded a video entitled \"Ending the Subscribe to Pewdiepie Meme\" in which he asked his followers to refrain from using the phrase \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", due to incidents such as the phrase being graffitied on a war memorial, and its mention by the Christchurch mosque shooter. While live streaming the following day, Kjellberg showed a plane flying over New York City with a banner attached saying \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", and called it \"a nice little wrap up\" to the meme.\n\n2019–2020: Minecraft series, milestones, and bans\nThe remainder of 2019 saw further controversies for PewDiePie. In early June, Kjellberg uploaded a video on YouTube sponsored by social media application Nimses. The app spiked in popularity after he promoted it on his YouTube channel. Controversy ensued when Nimses' location features and privacy settings led fans of Kjellberg and fellow YouTubers to believe that he was promoting a privacy-invasive app, with some fans suspecting the app of being a pyramid scheme due to a referral program in the app that offered more in-application currency. The Pirate Party Germany criticized his promotion of Nimses, warning that Kjellberg was promoting a potentially harmful app to a large audience. Andrey Boborykin, the head of marketing and communications at Nimses, published a blog post denying the allegations that the app is privacy-invasive. Kjellberg responded to the allegations in a video, dismissing them as \"rumors\", and claimed that Nimses was no more invasive than other social media apps.\nDespite being surpassed by T-Series and the aforementioned controversy, Kjellberg continued to achieve high viewership on the site, mainly propelled by a return to consistent gaming uploads. On 21 June, Kjellberg launched Gaming Week, where he focused on uploading Let's Play videos every day, for the first time in several years. Among the games played was Minecraft, which he was openly surprised by how much he enjoyed it. Kjellberg largely centered his videos around Minecraft in the following months, with the content featured in his Meme Review and LWIAY series also becoming focused on the game. Although he had played Minecraft early in his YouTube career, he had very rarely played it in the following years due to his reluctance to join the trend of Minecraft YouTubers, who he felt only played the game because of its popularity rather than for their enjoyment. This lean into Minecraft was largely successful for Kjellberg, who received a large increase in views, achieving over 570 million views during the month of July, the most received by his channel in a single month since at least October 2016. His daily number of new subscribers grew from 25,000 to 45,000 during that month. Despite this success, Kjellberg insisted that he played the game for his enjoyment, and did not want to become solely a \"Minecraft YouTuber\", stating, \"If Minecraft gets boring, I can just move on to other things.\"\nOn 25 August, Kjellberg became the first individual YouTuber to surpass 100 million subscribers. His channel was the second overall to reach the milestone, after T-Series, who passed the mark earlier in the year. YouTube tweeted a congratulatory post to note the occurrence, and awarded him a Red Diamond Play Button. \nIn October, Kjellberg stated in a video that his YouTube content, as well as content related to him on other websites such as Reddit, had been blocked in China. He explained that this was due to his comments about the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and an image of Chinese president Xi Jinping being compared to Winnie the Pooh shown in a previous video. In November, Business Insider reported Kjellberg as a client of Re6l, a Toronto-based influencer media and ecommerce company. \nToward the end of the year, shortly after being acknowledged as the most-viewed creator of the year with more than 4 billion views in 2019, Kjellberg announced that he would take a break from YouTube the following year and deleted his Twitter account because of his dissatisfaction with the site. Kjellberg's hiatus ultimately proved to be brief, lasting a little over a month during early 2020. Taking short breaks from creating online content proved to become a behavior he would repeat throughout the following years. In his first video uploaded following his brief hiatus, Kjellberg made jokes about the COVID-19 pandemic and spoke in mock-Chinese phrases. After receiving criticism for these jokes, Kjellberg uploaded another video, defending his previous jokes and making further jokes about COVID-19.\nKjellberg signed an exclusive deal to stream on YouTube in May, as the platform was enrolling high-profile streamers to rival competitors like Twitch and Mixer. At the time of signing with YouTube, Kjellberg had amassed over 800,000 followers on DLive, but due to his deal with the former, and not having streamed on the latter in four months, Tubefilter noted that it was unclear if Kjellberg was still affiliated with DLive. Kjellberg's DLive channel was eventually deactivated.\nIn October, Kjellberg's fans began to suspect his channel was shadowbanned, after noticing it and his recent uploads failed to appear in YouTube's search results. YouTube responded to the shadowban allegations on Twitter, claiming that the reason for the problems was due to search results being influenced by YouTube's system somehow flagging his recent uploads, and that due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube was taking longer to review videos, including Kjellberg's. YouTube apologized for the situation and stated they were \"working on fixing the issue.\"\n\n2020–present: soft retirement and move to Japan\nIn November 2020, Kjellberg uploaded a Q&A video, reflecting on his YouTube career. During the video, he expressed that he views himself as \"retired\" from YouTube, having felt so internally since earlier in the year. He continued to upload videos fairly frequently on the platform afterwards, albeit, inconsistently. He also \"committed to posting more unstructured content, like vlogs.\"\nIn January 2021, Kjellberg signed a distribution deal with Jellysmack, a content creation company. The deal entails Jellysmack optimizing and then distributing Kjellberg's content for a Facebook Watch audience. Although now having his content released onto the Facebook platform, Kjellberg continued to debut his content on YouTube.\nOn 14 February, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track titled \"Coco\" about Cocomelon, a kids-oriented channel which had been rising in subscribers for several years, and was growing by nearly two million subscribers per month. Kjellberg clarified that the children appearing in the music video were provided with a clean version of the lyrics to mime to while they were being filmed, and that their parents allowed them to participate in the video. The video was later taken down by YouTube who claimed that it violated their policies on harassment and child safety. Kjellberg stated he \"[didn't] actually care about Cocomelon\" and did not want the pretend-rivalry with the channel to \"get out of control\", as his rivalry with T-Series had previously.\n\nIn May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife Marzia moved from England to Japan. Much of his content following the move consisted of \"vlogs about daily life around Tokyo.\" In September, Kjellberg explained the shift his upload philosophy underwent when he announced his \"retirement\" from the platform: he opted to share videos for fun, as he did when he first began uploading videos.\nOn 14 November 2022, MrBeast surpassed Kjellberg as the most-subscribed individual creator on YouTube. The two have been noted as contemporaries and friends, with MrBeast having previously supported the 'Subscribe to PewDiePie' campaign during Kjellberg's competition with T-Series. Previously, Kjellberg answered a viewer question relating to whether MrBeast would surpass his subscriber count, replying \"He definitely will ... He definitely deserves it, I hope he does it.\"\nAfter years of inactivity, Kjellberg's Twitch account began streaming episodes of the Canadian sitcom Trailer Park Boys in March 2023. This was part of a test by the distribution and monetization service CoPilot Media, as they were on the verge of rolling out \"PewDiePie Infinity\", \"essentially an endless loop of [Kjellberg]'s videos.\" On 9 May, Kjellberg's Twitch account received a ban despite only streaming this previously aired content. Kjellberg's Twitch account has received further temporary bans in July 2023 and October 2024, for ambiguous reasons.\nOn 29 June 2023, Kjellberg announced he would be taking an indefinite hiatus from YouTube due to his imminent fatherhood. He would shortly thereafter return to making videos in August. In May 2024, Kjellberg expressed discontent with what he described as an \"infestation\" of YouTubers visiting Japan to create \"obnoxious\" content for attention and \"hate clicks\". In November, Kjellberg uploaded a video detailing his progress after drawing everyday for a year.\n\nYouTube content\nStyle\nEarly in his career, Kjellberg's content mainly consisted of Let's Play videos. His commentaries of horror games made up his best-known content during this early stage, although he eventually expanded into other genres. Unlike conventional walkthroughs, Kjellberg devoted his Let's Play videos to communicating more personally with his audience. Variety detailed that Kjellberg \"acts like he's spending time with a friend. He begins each video introducing himself in a high-pitched, goofy voice, drawing out the vowels of his YouTube moniker, then delves into the videos.\"\nKnown for his idiosyncratic sense of humor, the nature of his video content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and obnoxious, yet genuine and unfiltered. Lev Grossman of Time noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\" Rob Walker of Yahoo! wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\" Occasionally, Kjellberg resorts to just gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary; his playthrough of The Last of Us was detailed to leave the usually vocal gamer speechless at its ending.\nWith his channel's growth, Kjellberg's content has become more diverse; in addition to traditional Let's Play videos, he has uploaded content including vlogs, comedy shorts, and formatted shows. Toward the end of the 2010s, he began uploading much reaction-style content, such as his late 2018 and early 2019 videos reacting to various compilations of TikTok videos. Kjellberg has also uploaded music onto his channel, often accompanied by animation, fan art, or live footage. Oftentimes, music videos uploaded onto his channel are collaborative in nature, as he has worked with artists such as The Gregory Brothers (also known as Schmoyoho), Boyinaband, Roomie, and Party In Backyard.\n\nProduction and output\nDuring the early portion of his YouTube career, Kjellberg did not hire any editor or outside assistance to help with his video output, stating he wanted \"YouTube to be YouTube.\" While his early videos would simply feature raw footage, he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos. Swedish magazine Icon noted his use of the Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. On separate occasions, he later sought an editor and a production assistant to help with his content creation. Although now having an editor for his videos, in a 2017 video, he maintained that \"I'm just a guy. It's literally just me. There's not a producer out there [...] there's no writer, there's no camera guy.\" In July of that same year, Kjellberg commented that a couple of months prior, he had an office and a limited number of employees assisting him with his content creation.\nKjellberg has been noted by both himself and media outlets as prolific on the platform, having uploaded videos with a high frequency. By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 of which have been made private. As a result, Kjellberg has made videos and statements expressing his feelings of burnout from frequently creating content for the platform and its effect on his mental health. In March 2017, Kjellberg commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, \"[there's] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, [...] but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nSubscribers and viewership\nMedia writers have noted that Kjellberg's content has been largely built up \"methodically,\" as opposed to him having risen to fame through a viral video. At the same time, the growth of Kjellberg's channel has been described as rapid by various sources; Douglas Holt of the Harvard Business Review commented that \"the power of crowdculture propelled [Kjellberg] to global fame and influence in record time.\" Many close to Kjellberg have described him as \"steadfastly loyal to his YouTube audience,\" with one calling him \"a little spectrumy\" in this regard.\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers, and on 9 May 2012, it reached 500,000 subscribers. In March 2012, Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that Kjellberg had uploaded at least one video per day for the seven months preceding their report. Additionally, the publication noted that Kjellberg's channel accumulated 71 million total video views to that point and 25 million video views in February 2012 alone. The channel reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012, and 2 million subscribers in September.\nThroughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained. In 2013, the channel grew from 3.5 million to just under 19 million subscribers, and by the end of 2013, it was gaining a new subscriber every 1.037 seconds. Billboard reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013. In June 2013, Tubefilter began a monthly listing of the most viewed YouTube channels. In 2013, Kjellberg was consistently toward the top of this listing, ranking #1 in June, July, August, October, and December of that year. Analyzing Tubefilter's data, The Guardian reported that Kjellberg's channel earned 1.3 billion video views in the second half of 2013. The channel had two of the ten most-viewed gaming videos in 2013: the sixth-part of his Mad Father Let's Play was the third-most viewed of the year, earning 27 million views, and an entry in his Funny Gaming Montage series ranked as the eight-most viewed gaming video of 2013.\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers, and in April, he was covered in The New York Times after surpassing 6 million subscribers. Many of Kjellberg's most-viewed videos are highlight compilations of his Let's Play videos. One of these compilations, \"A Funny Montage\", was uploaded in June 2013, and spent a considerable amount of time as Kjellberg's most-viewed, with publications citing it as such through 2018.\nIn July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second-most-subscribed YouTube user, and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July. Kjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August 2013. On 31 October 2013, his channel became the first to reach 15 million subscribers. Shortly after, PewDiePie was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight channel in subscribers. After jostling for the top position during the next month, PewDiePie's channel took firm hold of the most-subscribed title on 23 December. On 9 January 2014, the channel reached the 20 million subscriber milestone.\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's channel was the most-viewed in January, and then for seven consecutive months from March to September. In August 2014, Tubefilter reported that the channel surpassed the Rihanna VEVO channel on 19 July as the most-viewed on YouTube at around 5.2 billion video views. Data from Social Blade, however, shows that the channel still had less video views than the emimusic channel. According to their data, the channel surpassed emimusic on 29 December 2014, at over 7.2 billion views, to become the most-viewed channel on the website. According to Tubefilter and The Guardian, the channel amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and around 4.1 billion video views in 2014; both figures were higher than any other user. The latter figure was a reported 81% increase from the channel's video views in 2013; the channel was the most viewed in that year, as well.\nDuring July 2015, his videos were documented to receive over 300 million views per month. It eclipsed the 10 billion video view milestone on 6 September 2015, becoming the first channel to do so. At that time, \"A Funny Montage\" (then-titled \"Funny Montage #1\") was Kjellberg's most-viewed video, with approximately 68.8 million views; a partial reason it accumulated many views was due to its status as the PewDiePie channel trailer. In 2016, the channel experienced decreased viewership, which was similarly experienced by other content creators across the platform, due to changes in YouTube's algorithm. On 8 December, it reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.\nOnline campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017. Renewed interest in Kjellberg's videos due to his subscriber competition with T-Series resulted in his channel earning over 500 million video views in December 2018, which was then the channel's single-highest monthly view count. After briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube. The day after \"Congratulations\" was uploaded, Kjellberg temporarily regained his lead over T-Series as the most subscribed channel.\nIn July 2019, in large part due to Kjellberg's Minecraft gameplay videos, his channel surged in video views. The Verge noted that it was Kjellberg's most successful month in years, in terms of viewership. Data from Social Blade shows the channel received 573 million video views, a then-single-month record amount of views for Kjellberg's channel. Kjellberg was the most-viewed creator of 2019, with his channel receiving over 4 billion views during the year.\nAlong with T-Series, the PewDiePie channel is one of only two on YouTube to receive all five tiers of YouTube Creator Awards: Silver, Gold, Diamond, Custom, and Red Diamond Creator. These awards are earned upon surpassing the 100,000; 1 million; 10 million; 50 million; and 100 million subscriber milestones, respectively. Kjellberg nicknamed his Custom Creator Award the Ruby Play Button, which he received in 2016. In 2019, Kjellberg's channel became the second overall, and the first run by an individual creator, to receive the Red Diamond Creator Award. His YouTube channel is one of the top 10 most subscribed YouTube channels as of 2024.\n\nCritical reception\nKjellberg's YouTube content has been met with mixed critical reception. Media outlets write that he is one of the most popular creators online, despite being involved in multiple media controversies. His content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and filled with profanity, and his on-camera personality has been generally received as genuine, unfiltered, and self-aware by various outlets. Kjellberg's content has also been received negatively by the media, with detractors describing it as \"obnoxious\" and often reporting his popularity as an \"inexplicable phenomenon\". Rob Walker of Yahoo! has commented positively on Kjellberg's intelligence, stating Kjellberg is \"clearly\" smart based on when he speaks directly to his audience. Other outlets, such as Time and The Verge, have written similar sentiments, describing Kjellberg as \"articulate\" and \"self conscious\", respectively. In contrast, Andrew Wallenstein of Variety heavily criticised Kjellberg, following his channel becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube, describing his videos as \"aggressive stupidity\" and \"psychobabble.\"\nLev Grossman of Time noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\" Walker wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\" Justin Charity of The Ringer stated, \"PewDiePie isn't a comedian in any conventional sense,\" but described his \"hosting style [as] loopy and irreverent in the extreme: He's a little bit stand-up, a little bit shock jock, a little bit 4chan bottom-feeder.\"\nIn regards to his early Let's Play content, Swedish columnist Lars Lindstrom commented positively, stating that \"Felix Kjellberg [having] a comic talent is indisputable. It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes around with his son in the game Happy Wheels and both get crushed and bloody again and again and PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues. The secret is that he loves to play these games and that he has fun doing it.\" As his content went through changes in style in 2016, Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku wrote, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"\nFollowing the controversy regarding alleged antisemitic content in his videos, many media publications both in and outside of the gaming and tech industries severely criticised Kjellberg's content. These outlets suggested that Kjellberg's content contained and promoted fascist, white supremacist, and alt-right ideologies. A Wired article covering the controversy referred to him as a \"poster boy for white supremacists\". Charity opined that Kjellberg's \"occasional, reactionary irreverence has become a core component of his appeal. Likewise, for critics and fans who value inclusivity — and among outside observers who view [Kjellberg]'s conduct as inexplicably frequent in the news — [Kjellberg] represents all that is wrong and alienating about games culture.\"\n\nCensorship\nIn April 2019, \"Congratulations\" and \"Bitch Lasagna\" were banned in India when the Delhi High Court granted an injunction in favor of T-Series. The complaint against Kjellberg allegedly stated that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive,\" and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\" Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, Kjellberg's videos remain blocked in India.\nOn 16 October 2019, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his Meme Review series, in which he reacted to memes about the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. The video also featured his commentary on the China–NBA issue and the Blitzchung controversy, as well as memes comparing Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh. As a result, Kjellberg's channel and content were reportedly censored in China. The BBC wrote that instead of a complete ban, only \"some content related to the YouTuber has indeed been made inaccessible online,\" and that \"there is no evidence to suggest this was done on the orders of the government.\" The BBC suggested that Baidu seemingly removed PewDiePie-related messages on a forum out of caution, but that \"a [Baidu] search for his name still returns more than eight million results.\" Vox wrote that \"access to reposted PewDiePie videos and music\" appeared to be available to some regional users.\nAccording to Business Insider, \"For years, critics of Pewds have been campaigning for YouTube to bar him from the platform to no avail.\"\n\nPublic image and influence\nSince breaking through on YouTube with his Let's Play-styled videos, Kjellberg has emerged as one of the most noted, influential, and controversial online personalities. He has also been cited by various publications as largely influential for digital content creation and Internet culture, particularly relating to video gaming subcultures. Eurogamer noted that Kjellberg was cast by media reports as a \"figurehead\" of YouTubers, and for being nearly synonymous with gaming YouTubers in general. In 2016, Douglas Holt of Harvard Business Review wrote of Kjellberg as \"YouTube's greatest success\", and regarded him, about gaming subcultures, \"the star of this digital art world—just as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Patti Smith had done in urban art worlds back in the analog days\". Lev Grossman of Time wrote that Kjellberg dominated \"an entire medium single-handed,\" and pioneered \"a new form of fame not controlled or manufactured by a studio or a network.\"\nKjellberg has stated that he dislikes being called \"famous\". In a 2014 interview with The Wall Street Journal, he called the influence he has \"kind of scary\". In a Rolling Stone article, Kjellberg admitted to being shocked by his fame; he recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating \"I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up – it was out of control. It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person.\" In a 2019 interview with the New York Times, Kjellberg commented on his influence stating, \"it's weird for me to be in this position because I don't really want to be in this position.\" He went on to express feelings of nostalgia for his early YouTube career, when he had fewer subscribers, and admitted to periodically thinking about giving up the platform altogether. Colleagues and media have referred to Kjellberg as \"normally press shy\", \"quiet\", and \"much more reserved in real life.\" After moving to Japan, Kjellberg expressed enjoying a lack of recognition while in public.\n\nAs a YouTube personality\nAfter becoming the most-subscribed\nIn September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called Kjellberg's popularity \"insane\", writing that it \"strikes me as considerably more curious – I mean, you know who Rihanna is, but would you recognize this kid if he was standing in line behind you at the bank?\" Walker, among other reporters, has questioned and analysed reasons for his popularity. Walker commented on Kjellberg's interaction with his audience, writing, \"While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly more than willing to make fun of himself in the process.\"\nIn 2015, Ross Miller of The Verge wrote, \"Love it or hate it, his success – like so many other YouTube personalities – isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record.\" Writing about and analyzing Kjellberg's career, Kevin Roose of The New York Times wrote that during the period in which Kjellberg had the most-subscribed channel but prior to his alleged antisemitism controversy, \"[Kjellberg] was not just the YouTuber with the biggest channel. To many Inner YouTubers, he represented the values of the platform — lo-fi, authentic, defiantly weird.\"\n\nFollowing media controversies\nIn the wake of the Wall Street Journal controversy, John Herman of The New York Times commented that \"[Kjellberg] bemoaned [YouTube's] structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting, and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube's very own populist reactionary.\" YouTube's chief business officer Robert Kyncl stated Kjellberg \"underestimated the responsibility he had as the platform's most popular ambassador, even if he himself is not a hateful person.\"\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of The Guardian wrote, \"Given the scale of his audience and his influence, not much is written about PewDiePie. Tech sites like The Verge and Polygon report on him and often critique him severely. But in the mainstream media, his name has broken through only either as a result of novelty or scandal,\" and noted that his content was rarely written about. Touching on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, MacInnes also added that he \"is funny, intelligent, innovative and highly charismatic [...] to call him an alt-right agitator would perhaps be unfair as he has never publicly identified with the proto-fascist movement. But he shares much of their culture and amplifies it across the world. People should pay PewDiePie more attention.\"\nMax Read of Intelligencer retrospectively opined on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, commenting that \"Kjellberg, for his part, is seen as a standard-bearer for the oppressed YouTuber subject to the whims of YouTube's corporate masters — a symbol of the ongoing tension between YouTube and the culture that it spawned,\" and added that \"he, through fights over his behavior and his position within the YouTube space, is something like a gateway drug to bigger political battles over free speech, the role of media, and diversity.\"\nShortly prior to his 2020 hiatus, Erin Nyren of Variety commented that Kjellberg's \"popularity continues unabated in spite of—or perhaps because of—the fact that he has been the subject of ongoing controversies.\"\n\nMedia lists and rankings\nKjellberg's influence has ranked highly on various lists. Subtitled as the \"King of YouTube\" on The Verge's 2014 \"Verge 50\" list—the outlet's \"definitive list of the most interesting people building the future.\" On his listing's blurb, The Verge wrote that \"Kjellberg's real talent is finding the human within games. He's just a normal person, finding the authentic in games for an audience that are desperate for a little more humanity.\" In 2015, Kjellberg was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, with the publication writing that his channel \"broadcasts some of the most-watched programs in pop culture.\" Later in 2015, Kjellberg was featured on the cover of Variety's \"Famechangers\" issue, with the magazine ranking him as the \"#1 Famechanger\", or \"those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest\".\nThe following year, Time included him on their Time 100 list, with South Park co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, \"I know it might seem weird, especially to those of us from an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to see it as the birth of a new art form. And I don't think anyone should underestimate its most powerful artist.\" Forbes wrote that \"[Kjellberg's] overall brand suffered earlier this year [2017] when he included antisemitic content in nine of his videos,\" when citing their reason for not ranking him as the top gaming influence. Forbes still included Kjellberg in the gaming category of their June 2017 \"Top Influencers\" list. In September 2019, The Sunday Times ranked him first on their list of the UK's 100 most influential people online.\n\nChannel demographics\nKjellberg's channel appeals strongly to younger viewers, a group Google refers to as \"Generation C\" for their habits of \"creation, curation, connection and community\". This demographic has been more commonly referred to as Generation Z by researchers and popular media. In a 2017 video, Kjellberg shared a screenshot of data provided by YouTube regarding his channel statistics, which suggested his largest demographic was among the 18–24 age group, followed by the 25–34 age group. Surveys conducted throughout the 2010s highlighted that favorable opinions of Kjellberg, as well as his name recognition and online influence within these age ranges, was comparable to that of mainstream figures such as Jennifer Lawrence, Justin Bieber, and LeBron James. \nThe New York Times published results of an online reader poll the publication held, showing that only 17% of their digital readers correctly identified Kjellberg after seeing an image of him; the outlet wrote that the poll's results \"probably reflect the fact that Times readers are older than a representative sample of Americans, citing that \"in 2015, the median digital Times subscriber was 54 years old.\" In 2016, Maker Studios' international chief content officer was cited in The Guardian as comparing \"the average parent's bafflement at their teenage children's passion for stars like PewDiePie, KSI, and Zoella to past generations' inability to comprehend punk rock or gangsta rap.\"\nStudies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of video game players engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to being an important reason for Kjellberg's popularity.\n\nFan base\nESPN noted in 2015 that Kjellberg typically performed a \"Brofist\" gesture at the end of his videos, and often referred to his fan base as the \"Bro Army\", addressing his audience as \"bros\". Likewise, media outlets also adopted the name when referring to Kjellberg's fan base. Later in his YouTube career, Kjellberg stopped using the term \"Bro Army\", and began to refer to his audience as \"Squad Fam\", \"9 year olds\", and later \"19 year olds\", in his videos. The fan base has been subject to criticism; in July 2018, Wired published an article, referring to Kjellberg's fan base as \"toxic\", stating that \"it's not just that they've stuck with the Swedish gamer/alleged comedian as he peppered his videos with racial slurs, rape jokes, antisemitism, and homophobia for nearly a decade (though that's bad enough). It's also that they insist that PewDiePie somehow isn't being hateful at all.\"\nAt the 2013 Social Star Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so. Kjellberg also mentioned this event to Rolling Stone, stating, \"I didn't even understand they were screaming for me at first.\" Kjellberg has commented on fans from Malaysia and Singapore; during a trip to Kuala Lumpur in 2016, fans entered his hotel to search for him, which he expressed annoyance with. In a 2019 vlog, Kjellberg expressed that fans in Malaysia and Singapore can be \"very hectic and scream-ish and crazy, and they lose their minds when they see you.\" He later apologized to fans from the two countries, stating that seeing the effect he had \"on fans back then [during his 2013 trip to Singapore] was cool\" and that he would \"be lying\" if he claimed to hate this initial experience with fans, although added that he has grown to not enjoy being treated as more than a person. Business Insider Singapore reported that some fans took offense to Kjellberg's comments, but that \"most netizens accepted the YouTuber's apology and admitted that fans had gone overboard in invading his privacy.\"\nRelating to his responsibility to his audience, Kjellberg has stated, \"many people see me as a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day,\" adding, \"The loneliness in front of the computer screens brings us together. But I never set out to be a role model; I just want to invite them to come over to my place.\" Correlating with this note, his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves. Conversely, during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one Kotaku reporter, respondents described him as \"annoying\" and an \"obnoxious waste of time.\" Additionally, Rolling Stone has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of Kjellberg.\n\nInfluence on video games\nKjellberg has been noted to support video games from indie developers, often having played through such titles in his videos. His commentaries have had a positive effect on sales of indie games, with The Washington Post writing that \"gamemakers have observed a kind of Oprah effect.\" The developers of the indie game McPixel stated, \"The largest force driving attention to McPixel at that time were 'Let's Play' videos. Mostly by Jesse Cox and PewDiePie.\" Kjellberg has also been confirmed to have driven the popularity of Yandere Simulator during that game's development, and positively influenced the sales of Slender: The Eight Pages and Goat Simulator. Although games being featured on Kjellberg's channel have reportedly contributed to their commercial success, he has stated, \"I just want to play the games, not influence sales.\"\nIn 2019, Kjellberg's Minecraft videos led a surge of interest towards the game, which saw an increase in players. It also registered the largest-trending score on YouTube since January 2017 and surpassed Fortnite as the most-searched game on YouTube, with the searches for Minecraft on Google almost doubling since previous months. Video game media outlets, such as Polygon and The Verge, largely credited this newfound success to Kjellberg, with The Verge suggesting that the surge \"proves that the 'PewDiePie Effect' is still real\" (about the Oprah effect-like success enjoyed by games Kjellberg has played). Several other popular YouTubers followed suit by focusing on Minecraft content. Polygon also noted that in the wake of Kjellberg's focus on Minecraft, YouTubers focused on Fortnite began to shift towards making Minecraft videos instead.\nKjellberg, along with characters from Amnesia: The Dark Descent, were referred to by a McPixel level designed in his honour. Additionally, in the video game Surgeon Simulator 2013, the Alien Surgery stage features an organ called \"Pewdsball\" in honour of Kjellberg. Kjellberg agreed to allow the developers of Surgeon Simulator 2013 to use his likeness in GOTY IDST, a showering simulation video game. Kjellberg was also included as an NPC in the indie game Party Hard, and had a voice acting role in Pinstripe, a puzzle adventure game.\n\nIncome\nIn March 2014, Kjellberg made an estimated $140,000–$1.4 million from YouTube revenue, according to Social Blade. In June 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that Kjellberg earned $4 million in 2013; Kjellberg confirmed on Reddit that the figures were somewhat close to what he actually earned. In July 2015, the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that Kjellberg's production company, PewDie Productions AB, reported earnings of 63.7 million SEK ($7.5 million) in 2014. In 2015, outlets described Kjellberg's income as sizeable, and even \"remarkable\"; Kjellberg appeared at the top of Forbes' October 2015 list of the richest YouTube stars with a reported $12 million earned in 2015.\nIn December 2016, Forbes named Kjellberg as the highest-earning YouTuber with his annual income reaching $15 million. This was up 20% from 2015, largely due to his YouTube Red series Scare PewDiePie and his book This Book Loves You, which sold over 112,000 copies according to Nielsen Bookscan. Kjellberg relies on external revenue sources rather than YouTube's ad model, which he has stated is common for most YouTube content creators; Kjellberg commented that YouTube's ad revenue model is inefficient, unstable, and insecure. According to Forbes, Kjellberg's income dropped to $12 million in 2017, which made him the sixth highest-paid YouTuber during that year. Forbes commented that Kjellberg's income would have been higher had he avoided the pushback from advertisers resulting from the controversies surrounding his videos in 2017.\nExtensive media coverage on his earnings has been met with frustration by Kjellberg, who has stated that he is \"tired of talking about how much [he makes]\", and suggested that media outlets should rather report on the money he raised for charity. The Guardian commented that the reason the media was so captivated by Kjellberg's earnings is that the topic \"offers a rare insight into the money being made at the top end of YouTube stardom,\" adding \"it's very rare for any YouTube creator to talk about their earnings publicly, not least because YouTube itself does not encourage it.\"\n\nSponsorships\nBeginning in April 2014 and spanning into August, Kjellberg, along with his then-girlfriend Marzia, began a marketing campaign for the Legendary Pictures film As Above, So Below. Kjellberg's videos for the marketing campaign included a miniseries featuring him participating in the \"Catacombs Challenge\". The challenge involved Kjellberg searching for three keys in the catacombs to open a container holding \"the Philosopher's stone\". The couple's videos were able to earn nearly 20 million views. Maker Studios, which both Kjellberg and Marzia were represented by, brokered the ad deal between the two and Legendary Pictures. In January 2015, Mountain Dew partnered with Kjellberg to launch a fan fiction contest, in which winning fan fiction will be animated into video formats and then uploaded onto his channel.\nWhile he entered partnerships early in his YouTube career, Kjellberg maintained that he worked with few brands and conducted few promotions. He stated he felt he made enough money from YouTube and found endorsing too many brands to be disrespectful to his fans. On this topic, Kjellberg has expressed disappointment when a sizable portion of people misinterpret his intentions; he stated, \"if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it.\" Eventually, Kjellberg began to work with more brands, stating that he wanted to have a genuine relationship with brands and added he was lucky to not be dependent on working with them to support his career. In January 2019, Kjellberg announced a partnership with energy drink company G Fuel.\n\nOther ventures\nVideo games, authorship, and fashion design\nOn 24 September 2015, Kjellberg released his own video game, PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist, on iOS and Android. The game was developed by Canadian game developer Outerminds in collaboration with Kjellberg. On 29 September 2016, he released another game developed by Outerminds, PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator. It was released as a free app on iOS and Android devices and reached the number one spot on the App Store within a few days of its release. On 31 October 2017, former Goat Simulator developer and lead designer Armin Ibrisagic announced his partnership with Kjellberg for his video game Animal Super Squad. Kjellberg helped Ibrisagic with the core concept of the game and provided him with feedback and creative direction. In 2019, Kjellberg released two more video games: PewDiePie's Pixelings on 15 November and Poopdie on 12 December. The latter game was rejected from the App Store due to its \"crude imagery and sound effects which may disgust users\", but is available on Android.\nPenguin Group's Razorbill imprint released Kjellberg's This Book Loves You, a parody of self-help books, on 20 October 2015. The book is a collection of anti-proverbs paired with visuals. It was number-one on The New York Times Best Seller list for two weeks in the Young Adult Paperback category. Kjellberg and his wife Marzia launched Tsuki, a unisex clothing brand which they announced in a YouTube video.\n\nAppearances in other media\nAside from his own YouTube channel, Kjellberg has made appearances in the videos of other YouTube creators. In April 2013, he made a cameo in an episode of Epic Rap Battles of History, portraying Mikhail Baryshnikov. In July 2013, he starred alongside Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox of Smosh, as well as Jenna Marbles, as guest judges on the second season of Internet Icon. Kjellberg also appeared in YouTube's annual year-end Rewind series each year from 2013 to 2016; he once again appeared in YouTube Rewind in 2019.\nOn 3 June 2014, Sveriges Radio announced that Kjellberg was chosen to host his own episode of the Swedish radio show Sommar i P1. Due to his international popularity, the episode was recorded in both Swedish and English. The Swedish version was broadcast on 9 August 2014 on Sveriges Radio P1, and when the broadcast started the English version was published online. The link to the Swedish version of the broadcast was shared over 3,500 times, and the link to the English version was shared about 49,000 times.\nIn December 2014, Kjellberg guest-starred in two episodes of the 18th season of South Park. The two episodes served as a two-part season finale. The first part, titled \"#REHASH\" aired on 3 December, while the second part, titled \"#HappyHolograms\", aired on 10 December. In the episodes, he parodied himself and other Let's Play commentators, providing commentary over Call of Duty gameplay in an overly expressive way.\nIn July 2015, Kjellberg was announced as a voice actor in the Vimeo fantasy series, Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures. In October of the same year, he appeared as a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where Colbert referred to him as \"Emperor of the Internet\". In February 2016, he appeared on Conan, playing Far Cry Primal as part of the show's Clueless Gamer segment. In 2019, he was a guest on the Cold Ones YouTube podcast.\n\nPhilanthropy\nKjellberg's popularity has allowed him to stir support for fundraising drives. In February 2012, Kjellberg ran for King of the Web, an online contest. He lost the overall title, but still became the \"Gaming King of the Web\" for the 1–15 February 2012 voting period. During the following voting period, Kjellberg won and donated his cash winnings to the World Wildlife Fund. He has raised money for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and began a \"Water Campaign\" charity, where his fans could donate money to Charity: Water, in celebration of reaching ten million subscribers. Kjellberg contributed one dollar to the charity for every 500 views the video announcing the campaign accumulated, up to a maximum of $10,000. Kjellberg had the stated goal of raising US$250,000, but at the end of the drive, the amount raised was $446,612. Kjellberg organized another charity drive for Charity: Water in February 2016. The drive raised $152,239, surpassing a $100,000 goal.\nIn celebration of reaching 25 million subscribers in June 2014, Kjellberg announced another charity drive for Save the Children. It raised over $630,000, surpassing a $250,000 goal. In an interview with the Swedish magazine Icon, he has expressed a desire to continue these drives as time goes on, and also credited John and Hank Green as two individuals who gave him the idea of making unique videos for charity. These videos are purchased by game manufacturers and advertisers, for prices ranging up to $50,000.\nIn December 2016, he hosted Cringemas, a livestream held across two days (9 and 10 December, both at around 6 pm–10 pm GMT), with other Revelmode creators. During the livestream, they helped raise money for RED, a charity committed to helping eliminate HIV/AIDS in Africa. After the first day, the fundraiser raised over $200,000, after YouTube doubled their goal of $100,000, and at the end of the livestream, they had raised a total of over $1.3 million with help from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\nOn 3 December 2018, Kjellberg announced that he had started a fundraiser on GoFundMe for Child Rights and You (CRY) to help Indian children, partially in response to racist comments left on his videos directed toward Indians. Kjellberg also hosted a livestream on 4 December, donating all of its proceeds to CRY. He raised over $200,000.\nOn 21 July 2019, Kjellberg started a fundraiser on GoFundMe with American actor Jack Black for National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), in the wake of the suicide of the internet personality Etika in June 2019. Kjellberg and Jack Black streamed themselves playing Minecraft together to raise money for their fundraiser. Kjellberg donated $10,000 to his fundraiser and managed to raise over $30,000 for NAMI. Kjellberg has previously spoken on the topic of mental health, including his struggles with his own, and as part of the UK's Mental Health Awareness Week in 2017, he highlighted various resources to help one's mental health in a video.\nIn celebration of receiving his 100 million subscribers Play Button in September 2019, Kjellberg announced in a video that he was donating $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an international Jewish non-governmental organisation. Part of Kjellberg's fanbase criticized his decision, citing controversial actions and stances of the ADL. Kotaku and Vice praised Kjellberg's donation and were critical of the portion of Kjellberg's fanbase who opposed the donation. Two days after his initial announcement, Kjellberg announced in another video that he had decided to withdraw his donation. He expressed that he was advised to donate to the ADL, and did not hand-pick an organization that he was passionate about, as he had done with previous donations. Additionally, he confirmed that he would still make a $50,000 donation to an organization at some point in the future, but after undergoing his usual process to select a suitable one.\nOn 31 October 2019, Kjellberg donated $69,420 to Team Trees, a fundraising drive taking action against deforestation by pledging to plant one tree for every dollar donated. The donation number is a comedic in-joke combining numbers from internet culture: 69 and 420.\nIn early June 2020, Kjellberg raised more than $116,000 for the Sentencing Project, victims of police brutality, and for small businesses affected by Black Lives Matter demonstrators looting and rioting after the murder of George Floyd.\nKjellberg pledged to donate money earned from his YouTube membership to various charities every month. By 2021, Kjellberg raised over $1 million to charities such as Red Nose Day, Movember, Papyrus, Blue Ocean Foundation, Save the Children Lebanon, and Winston's Wish.\n\nPersonal life\nKjellberg married his long-term Italian girlfriend Marzia Bisognin on 19 August 2019. The couple have one son, born 11 July 2023.\nKjellberg and Bisognin were introduced to each other through a friend of Bisognin's in 2011, and after establishing an online relationship, Kjellberg flew to Italy to meet her. The pair shuffled between Sweden and Italy, before settling in Brighton, England. Kjellberg explained that they moved to the UK in July 2013 for preference to live close to the sea and for better Internet connectivity. He said he enjoyed the general anonymity that living in Brighton granted him.\nA 2018 trip to Japan inspired Kjellberg to move to the country. Announcing their intention to permanently move there, Kjellberg and his wife bought a home in Japan in 2019. The home was burgled in late 2019, and the couple's move was delayed due to Japan restricting relocation regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife moved to their home in Japan with a 5-year business visa. \nRegarding his political beliefs, Kjellberg stated in October 2019 that he is \"more apolitical than anything\", and that he was \"somewhere in between\" left-wing and right-wing. In June 2014, Kjellberg stated that he is an agnostic atheist.\nKjellberg has frequently mentioned in videos that he adheres to a pescetarian diet for various reasons. To deal with stress stemming from his content creation workload, Kjellberg developed a daily whiskey-drinking habit. During a Cold Ones podcast interview in July 2019, Kjellberg shared that a book on Buddhism inspired him to drop the habit.\n\nFilmography\nTelevision\nWeb\nMusic videos\nVideo games\nGameography\nDiscography\nBibliography\nThis Book Loves You (15 October 2015)\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nInternet in Sweden\nList of YouTubers\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nPrimary video, playlist, and post sources\nIn the text these references are preceded by a double dagger (‡):\n\nFurther reading and viewing\nParment, Anders (2014).

Jericho is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west. In 2017, it had a population of 20,907.\nFrom the end of the era of Mandatory Palestine, the city was annexed and ruled by Jordan from 1949 to 1967 and, with the rest of the West Bank, has been subject to Israeli occupation since 1967; administrative control was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world, and it is also the city with the oldest known defensive wall. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nIn 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".\n\nEtymology\nJericho's name in Modern Hebrew, Yeriẖo, is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word rēḥ 'fragrant', but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word Yaraḥ 'moon' or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.\nJericho's Arabic name, Arīḥā, means 'fragrant' and also has its roots in Canaanite Reaẖ.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nThe first excavations of the site were carried out by Charles Warren in 1868. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and John Garstang excavated between 1930 and 1936. Kathleen Kenyon worked there between 1952 and 1958, followed by Lorenzo Nigro and Nicolò Marchetti  in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome \"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015. The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.\n\nStone Age: Tell es-Sultan and spring\nThe earliest excavated settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, tell means \"mound\" – consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.\n\nNatufian hunter-gatherers, c. 10,000 BCE\nEpipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian culture structures beginning earlier than 9000 BCE, the beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.\nJericho has evidence of settlement dating back to c. 10,000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic, c. 9500–6500 BCE\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic at Jericho is divided in Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)\nThe first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000 BCE. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed \"Pre-Pottery Neolithic A\" (abbreviated as PPNA). Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:\n\nsmall circular dwellings\nburial of the dead under the floor of buildings\nreliance on hunting of wild game\ncultivation of wild or domestic cereals\n\nAt Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\n\nThe Pre-Sultan (c. 8350 – 7370 BCE) is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a 40,000 square metres (430,000 sq ft) settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 metres (12 ft) high and 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over 8.5 metres (28 ft) high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest towers ever to be discovered. The wall of Jericho may have served as a defence against flood-water, with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower were built during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period around 8000 BCE. For the tower, carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2,000–3,000, and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) was a period of about 1.4 millennia, from 7220 to 5850 BCE (though carbon-14-dates are few and early). The following are PPNB cultural features:\n\nExpanded range of domesticated plants\nPossible domestication of sheep\nApparent cult involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using plaster, and eyes set with shells in some cases\n\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 m × 4 m (21.3 ft × 13.1 ft) and 7 m × 3 m (23.0 ft × 9.8 ft)) with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\n\nChalcolithic\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nIn Early Bronze I, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIA1 (EB IA, c. 3500-3200 BCE) and Sultan IIIA2 (EB IB, c. 3200-3000 BCE).\nIn Early Bronze II, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIB1 (EB IIA, c. 3000-2850 BCE) and Sultan IIIB2 (EB IIB, c. 2850-2700 BCE).\nIn the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450 BCE; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600 BCE.\nDuring Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350 BCE; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.\nIn Early Bronze IV, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIID1 (EB IVA; 2300-2200 BCE) and Sultan IIID2 (EB IVB; 2200-2000 BCE).\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nJericho was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment ... part of a complex system\" of defenses. Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Carbon dating c. 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating c. 1550.\nChronology (Nigro 2016)\n\nMiddle Bronze IA, Tell es-Sultan IVa1 (c. 2000/1950-1900 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IB, Tell es-Sultan IVa2 (c. 1900-1800 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIA, Tell es-Sultan IVb1 (c. 1800-1700 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIB, Tell es-Sultan IVb2 (c. 1700-1650 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIC/III, Tell es-Sultan IVc (c. 1650-1550 BC)\n\nLate Bronze Age\nDecades after the destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city, it recovered again on a smaller scale during the Late Bronze Age (1450–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its emerging crest. Excavations have found a structure known as the \"Middle Building\" which apparently served as the residence of the city's local rulers, then vassals of the Egyptian empire.: 605  Ultimately, the Middle Building was destroyed, although it was later reused in the early Iron Age. According to Nigro (2023), the Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century BCE materials.: 602 \n\nHebrew Bible narrative\nThe Hebrew Bible tells the story of the Battle of Jericho led by Joshua, leading to the fall of the Canaanite city, the first one captured by the Israelites in the Promised Land. The historicity of biblical account is not generally accepted by scholars. Italian archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro suggests that the story might have developed from local memories of the destructions suffered by the Canaanite city in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, which were later used by the biblical writers to create their narrative.\n\nIron Age\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.\n\nPersian and Early Hellenistic periods\nAfter the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.\nJericho went from being an administrative centre of Yehud Medinata (\"the Province of Judah\") under Persian rule to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE Jericho was under Hellenistic rule of the Seleucid Empire, when the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the Macabees. One of these forts, built at the entrance to Wadi Qelt, was later refortified by Herod the Great, who named it Kypros after his mother.\n\nHasmonean and Herodian periods\nAfter the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and Early Roman or Herodian periods was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area. The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of Wadi Qelt. The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group (kohanim) from the tribe of Levi, who ruled over Judea following the success of the Maccabean Revolt until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.\nThe rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Mount of Temptation. They date between 100 BCE and 68 CE.\n\nHerodian period\nHerod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new  Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new  aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written ʾAlayiq). In 2008, the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.\nThe murder of Aristobulus III in a swimming pool at the Hasmonean royal winter palaces, as described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for Jerusalem's aristocracy.\nHerod was succeeded in Judea by his son, Herod Archelaus, who built a village in his name not far to the north, Archelaïs (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.\nFirst-century Jericho is described in Strabo's Geography as follows:\n\nJericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 stadia in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.\n\nIn the New Testament\nThe Christian Gospels state that Jesus of Nazareth passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars (Matthew 20:29), and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices (Luke 19:1–10). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nJohn Wesley, in his New Testament Notes on this section of Luke's Gospel, claimed that \"about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple\".\nSmith's Bible Names Dictionary suggests that \"Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacchaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan.\"\n\nRoman province\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the Bar Kochba revolt in 133.\n\nByzantine period\nAccounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a Byzantine Jericho, Ericha, was built 1600 metres (1 mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Sasanian invasion of 614.\nThe Jericho synagogue in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70 to 50 BCE. A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, or \"peace unto Israel\", after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor. It was controlled by Israel after the Six Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.\nThe Na'aran synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in similar condition.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nJericho, by then named \"Ariha\" in Arabic variation, became part of Jund Filastin (\"Military District of Palestine\"), part of the larger province of Bilad al-Sham. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab exiled the Jews and Christians of Khaybar to Jericho (and Tayma).\nBy 659, that district had come under the control of Mu'awiya, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho. A decade later, the pilgrim Arculf visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its \"miserable Canaanite\" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.\nA palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) and thus known as Hisham's Palace, is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This \"desert castle\" or qasr was more likely built by Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction. The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen in situ today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.\nUmayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the Arab caliphates of the Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile \"City of the Palms\". Al-Maqdisi, the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that \"the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all Islam. Bananas are plentiful, also dates and flowers of fragrant odor\". Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.\n\nCrusader period\nIn 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 kilometres (6 mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and were credited by 19th-century authors with introducing sugarcane production to the city, although now scholars date it to the pre-Crusader, Early Arab period. The Crusaders, however, have raised sugar production to the level of a large-scale industry. The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin, and the town slowly went into decline.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi said of Jericho, \"it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the Ghaur land is made here.\" In the 14th century, Abu al-Fida writes there are sulfur mines in Jericho, \"the only ones in Palestine\".\n\nOttoman period\n16th century\nJericho was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 Akçe was recorded, destined for the new Waqf for the Haseki Sultan Imaret of Jerusalem. The villagers processed indigo as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.\nIn 1596 Jericho appeared in the tax registers under the name of Riha, being in the nahiya of Al-Quds in the liwa of Al-Quds. It had a population of 51 households, all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 Akçe. All of the revenue still went to a Waqf.\n\n17th century\nThe French traveller Laurent d'Arvieux described the city in 1659 as \"now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated.\"\n\n19th century\nIn the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts. Edward Robinson (1838) reported 50 families, which were about 200 people, Titus Tobler (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 kuruş in tax. Abraham Samuel Herschberg (1858–1943) also reported after his 1899–1900 travels in the region of some 30 poor huts and 300 residents. At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called Ein al-Sultan, lit. \"Sultan's Spring\", in Arabic and Ein Elisha, lit. \"Elisha Spring\", in Hebrew, and springs in Wadi Qelt.\nJ. S. Buckingham (1786–1855) describes in his 1822 book how the male villagers of er-Riha, although nominally sedentary, engaged in Bedouin-style raiding, or ghazzu: the little land cultivation he observed was done by women and children, while men spent most of their time riding through the plains and engaging in \"robbery and plunder\", their main and most profitable activity.\nAn Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that Riha, Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men only.\nThe first excavation at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867.\n\n20th century\nThe Greek Orthodox monasteries of St. George of Choziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAfter the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Jericho came under British rule, as part of Mandatory Palestine.\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine, Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants (931 Muslims, 92 Christians, and six Jews). The Christian population consisted of 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics (Melkite Catholics), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, four Copts and one Church of England.\nIn 1927, an earthquake struck and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died, but by the 1931 census the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants (1,512 Muslims, 170 Christians, seven Druze, and four Jews), in 347 houses.\nIn the 1938 statistics, Jericho lists a population of 1,996 people (including five Jews).\nIn the 1945 statistics, Jericho's population was 3,010 (2,570 Muslims, 260 Christians, 170 Jews, and 10 \"other\") and it had jurisdiction over 37,481 dunams of land. Of this, 948 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 5,873 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 9,141 for cereals, while a total of 38 dunams were urban, built-up areas.\nDuring World War II The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.\n\nJordanian period\nJericho came under Jordanian control after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Jericho Conference, organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed \"His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine\" and called for \"the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity\". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.\nIn 1961, the population of Jericho was 10,166, of whom 935 were Christian, and the rest were Muslim.\n\n1967 and aftermath\nJericho has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to Palestinian Authority control in accordance with the Oslo Accords. The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the Gaza–Jericho Agreement of 4 May 1994. Part of the agreement was a \"Protocol on Economic Relations\", signed on 29 April 1994. The city is in an enclave of the Jordan Valley that is in Area A of the West Bank, while the surrounding area is designated as being in Area C under full Israeli military control. Four roadblocks encircle the enclave, restricting Jericho's Palestinian population's movement through the West Bank.\nIn response to the 2001 Second Intifada and suicide bombings, Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops. A 2-metre (6 ft 7 in) deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.\nOn 14 March 2006, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, Ahmad Sa'adat, and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001.\nAfter Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned Hilles clan, in response to their attack that killed six Hamas members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008.\nIn 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs David Johnson inaugurated the Presidential Guard Training Center in Jericho, a $9.1 million training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces built with U.S. funding. In 2024, a Jericho street was named after Aaron Bushnell, a U.S. soldier who self-immolated in support of Palestine.\n\nGeography and environment\nJericho is located 258 metres (846 ft) below sea level in an oasis in Wadi Qelt in the Jordan Valley, which makes it the lowest city in the world. The nearby spring of Ein es-Sultan produces 3.8 m3 (1,000 gallons) of water per minute, irrigating some 10 square kilometres (2,500 acres) through multiple channels and feeding into the Jordan River, 10 kilometres (6 mi) away.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 3,500 ha (8,600-acre) site encompassing the city of Jericho and its immediate surrounds has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins, lanner falcons, lesser kestrels, and Dead Sea sparrows.\n\nClimate\nAnnual rainfall is 204 mm (8.0 in), mostly concentrated in the winter months and into early spring. The average temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in January and 31 °C (88 °F) in July. According to the Köppen climate classification, Jericho has a hot desert climate (BWh). Rich alluvial soil and abundant spring water have made Jericho an attractive place for settlement.\n\nDemographics\nIn the first census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. Palestinian refugees constituted  43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.\nIn a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The Christian community makes up around 1% of the population. A large community of black Palestinians lives in Jericho.\n\nEconomy\nIn 1994, Israel and Palestine signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule.\nAgriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.\nThe Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.\n\nTourism\nIn 1998, a $150 million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat. The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.\nIn 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.\n\nBiblical and Christian landmarks\nChristian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.\n\nEin es-Sultan, known as the Spring of Elisha to Jews and Christians;\nQasr al-Yahud on the Jordan River, across from Bethany beyond the Jordan, traditionally identified as the location of the baptism of Jesus;\nMount of Temptation (Jebel Quruntul), traditionally identified as the location of the Temptation of Jesus;\nThe Greek Orthodox Monastery of the Temptation halfway up the mountain, beside a cave said to be the location where Jesus fasted for 40 days. It is connected to Jericho by a cable car;\n2 sycamore trees, both identified as the one mentioned in relation to Zacchaeus;\nDeir Hajla, the monastery of St. Gerasimos in the Jordan Valley near Jericho;\nSaint George Monastery in Wadi Qelt above Jericho.\n\nArchaeological landmarks\nStone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at Tell es-Sultan;\nHasmonean and Herodian winter palaces at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq;\nByzantine-period synagogues at Jericho (Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue) and Na'aran;\nUmayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as Hisham's Palace;\nCrusader sugar production facility at Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\");\nNabi Musa, the Mamluk and Ottoman shrine claimed to be the resting place of Moses (\"Prophet Musa\" to the Muslims)\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nIn 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.\n\nHealth care\nIn April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5 million in funding for this project.\n\nSports\nThe sports team Hilal Areeha plays association football in the West Bank First Division.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)",
        "content": "Doom is a 1993 first-person shooter game developed and published by id Software for MS-DOS. It is the first installment in the Doom franchise. The player assumes the role of a space marine, later unofficially referred to as Doomguy, fighting through hordes of undead humans and invading demons. The game begins on the moons of Mars and finishes in hell, with the player traversing each level to find its exit or defeat its final boss. It is an early example of 3D graphics in video games, and has enemies and objects as 2D images, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.\nDoom was the third major independent release by id Software, after Commander Keen (1990–1991) and Wolfenstein 3D (1992). In May 1992, id started developing a darker game focused on fighting demons with technology, using a new 3D game engine from the lead programmer, John Carmack. The designer Tom Hall initially wrote a science fiction plot, but he and most of the story were removed from the project, with the final game featuring an action-heavy design by John Romero and Sandy Petersen. Id published Doom as a set of three episodes under the shareware model, marketing the full game by releasing the first episode free. A retail version with an additional episode was published in 1995 by GT Interactive as The Ultimate Doom.\nDoom was a critical and commercial success, earning a reputation as one of the best and most influential video games of all time. It sold an estimated 3.5 million copies by 1999, and up to 20 million people are estimated to have played it within two years of launch. It has been termed the \"father\" of first-person shooters and is regarded as one of the most important games in the genre. It has been cited by video game historians as shifting the direction and public perception of the medium as a whole, as well as sparking the rise of online games and communities. It led to an array of imitators and clones, as well as a robust modding scene and the birth of speedrunning as a community. Its high level of graphic violence led to controversy from a range of groups. Doom has been ported to a variety of platforms both officially and unofficially and has been followed by several games in the series, including Doom II (1994), Doom 64 (1997), Doom 3 (2004), Doom (2016), Doom Eternal (2020), and Doom: The Dark Ages (2025), as well as the films Doom (2005) and Doom: Annihilation (2019).\n\nGameplay\nDoom is a first-person shooter presented with 3D graphics. While the environment is shown in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites rendered at fixed angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics or billboarding. In the single-player campaign mode, the player controls an unnamed space marine—later unofficially termed \"Doomguy\"—through military bases on the moons of Mars and in hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through labyrinthine areas to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped into named episodes, with the final level of each focusing on a boss fight.\nWhile traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and possessed undead humans. Enemies often appear in large groups. The five difficulty levels adjust the number of enemies and amount of damage they do, with enemies moving and attacking faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have simple behavior: they move toward their opponent if they see or hear them, and attack by biting, clawing, or using magic abilities such as fireballs.\nThe player must manage supplies of ammunition, health, and armor while traversing the levels. The player can find weapons and ammunition throughout the levels or can collect them from dead enemies, including a pistol, a shotgun, a chainsaw, a plasma rifle, and the BFG 9000. The player also encounters pits of toxic waste, ceilings that lower and crush objects, and locked doors requiring a collectable keycard or a remote switch. Power-ups include health or armor points, a mapping computer, partial invisibility, a radiation suit against toxic waste, invulnerability, or a super-strong melee berserker status. Cheat codes allow the player to unlock all weapons, walk through walls, or become invulnerable.\nTwo multiplayer modes are playable over a network: cooperative, in which two to four players team up to complete the main campaign, and deathmatch, in which two to four players compete to kill the other players' characters as many times as possible. Multiplayer was initially only playable over local networks, but a four-player online multiplayer mode was made available one year after launch through the DWANGO service.\n\nPlot\nDoom is divided into three episodes, each containing about nine levels: \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", \"The Shores of Hell\", and \"Inferno\". A fourth episode, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", was added in an expanded version, The Ultimate Doom, released two years after Doom. The campaign contains very few plot elements, with a minimal story presented mostly through the instruction manual and text descriptions between episodes.\nIn the future, an unnamed marine is posted to a dead-end assignment on Mars after assaulting a superior officer who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The Union Aerospace Corporation, which operates radioactive waste facilities there, allows the military to conduct secret teleportation experiments that turn deadly. A base on Phobos urgently requests military support, while Deimos disappears entirely, and the marine joins a combat force to secure Phobos. He secures the perimeter as ordered while the entire response team is wiped out. With no way off the moon, and armed with only a pistol, he enters the base intent on revenge.\nIn \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", the marine fights demons and possessed humans in the military and waste facilities on Phobos. The episode ends with the marine defeating two powerful Barons of Hell guarding a teleporter to the Deimos base. After the battle, the marine passes through the teleporter and is knocked unconscious by a horde of enemies, awakening with only a pistol. In \"The Shores of Hell\", the marine fights through corrupted research facilities on Deimos, culminating in the defeat of a gigantic cyberdemon. From an overlook, he discovers that the moon is floating above hell and rappels down to the surface. In \"Inferno\", the marine battles through hell itself and destroys a cybernetic spider-demon that masterminded the invasion of the moons. When a portal to Earth opens, the marine steps through to discover that Earth has been invaded. \"Thy Flesh Consumed\" follows the marine's initial assault on the Earth invaders, setting the stage for Doom II.\n\nDevelopment\nConcept\nId Software released Wolfenstein 3D in May 1992. Later called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\", it established the genre's popularity and its reputation for fast action and technological advancement. When most of the studio began work on additional episodes for Wolfenstein, id co-founder and lead programmer John Carmack instead began technical research on a new game. Following the release of Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny in September 1992, the team began to plan their next game. They were tired of Wolfenstein and wanted to create another 3D game using a new engine Carmack was developing. Co-founder and lead designer Tom Hall proposed a new game in the Commander Keen series, but the team decided that the Keen platforming gameplay was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines. Additionally, the other co-founders, designer John Romero and lead artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack) wanted to create something in a darker style than the Keen games. \nJohn Carmack conceived a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by a Dungeons & Dragons campaign the team played. This campaign would also influence the design of Quake (1996) and Daikatana (2000). More broadly the team intended to combine the styles of the Evil Dead II and Aliens films. The working title was Green and Pissed, but Carmack renamed it Doom based on a line from the 1986 film The Color of Money: \"'What you got in there?' / 'In here? Doom.'\"\nThe team agreed to pursue the Doom concept, and development began in November 1992. The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud, and designer Hall. They moved operations to a dark office building, naming it \"Suite 666\" while drawing inspiration from the noises they heard from a neighboring dental practice. They also decided to cut ties with Apogee Software, their previous publisher, and self-publish Doom, as they felt that they were outgrowing the publisher and could make more money by self-publishing.\n\nDesign\nIn November, Hall delivered a design document that he called the \"Doom Bible\", detailing the project's plot, backstory, and design goals. His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal to an alien invasion. Over a series of levels, the player discovers that the aliens are demons while hell steadily infects the level design. John Carmack not only disliked the proposed story but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: \"Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important.\" Rather than a deep story, he wanted to focus on technological innovation, dropping the levels and episodes of Wolfenstein in favor of a fast, continuous world. Hall disliked the idea, but the rest of the team sided with Carmack. Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the Doom Bible to work with Carmack's technological ideas. However, the team then realized that Carmack's vision for a seamless world would be impossible given the hardware limitations, and Hall was forced to rework the design document once again.\nAt the start of 1993, id put out a press release, touting Hall's story about fighting off demons while \"knee-deep in the dead\". The press release proclaimed the new 3D engine features that John Carmack had created, as well as aspects including multiplayer, that had not yet even been designed. Early versions were built to match the Doom Bible, and a \"pre-alpha\" version of the first level included Hall's introductory base scene. Initial versions also retained Wolfenstein's arcade-style scoring, but this was later removed as it clashed with Doom's intended tone. The studio also experimented with other game systems before removing them, such as lives, an inventory, a secondary shield, and a complex user interface.\n\nSoon, however, the Doom Bible as a whole was rejected. Romero wanted a game even \"more brutal and fast\" than Wolfenstein, which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team believed it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay, and they did not see the need for a design document at all. Some ideas were retained, but the story was dropped and most of the design was removed. By early 1993, Hall created levels that became part of an internal demo. Carmack and Romero, however, rejected the military architecture of Hall's level design. Romero especially believed that the boxy, flat level designs failed to innovate on Wolfenstein, and failed to show off the engine's capabilities. He began to create his own, more abstract levels, which the rest of the team saw as a great improvement.\nHall was upset with the reception of his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer. He was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies, and began to spend less time at work. The other developers, however, felt that Hall was not in sync with the team's vision and was becoming a problem. In July the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee. He was replaced by Sandy Petersen in September, ten weeks before the game was released. Petersen later recalled that John Carmack and Romero wanted to hire other artists instead, but Cloud and Adrian disagreed, saying that a designer was required to help build a cohesive gameplay experience. The team also added a third programmer, Dave Taylor.\nPetersen and Romero designed the rest of Doom's levels, with different aims: the team believed that Petersen's designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero's were more aesthetically interesting. In late 1993, a month before release, John Carmack began to add multiplayer. After the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player games, which Romero termed \"deathmatch\", and Cloud named the act of killing other players \"fragging\". According to Romero, the deathmatch mode was inspired by fighting games such as Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury, and Art of Fighting.\n\nEngine\nDoom was written largely in the C programming language, with a few elements in assembly language. The developers used NeXT computers running the NeXTSTEP operating system. The level and graphical data was stored in WAD files, short for \"Where's All the Data?\", separately from the engine. This allowed for any part of the design to be changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack designed this system so that fans could easily modify the game; he had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of Wolfenstein 3D and wanted to support that by releasing a map editor with an easily swappable file structure.\nUnlike Wolfenstein, which has flat levels with walls at right angles, the Doom engine allows for walls and floors at any angle or height but does not allow areas to be stacked vertically. The lighting system is based on adjusting the color palette of surfaces directly. Rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using ray tracing, the game calculates the \"light level\" of a small area based on the predetermined brightness of said area. It then modifies the color palette of that section's surface textures to mimic how dark it would look. This same system is used to cause far away surfaces to look darker than close ones.\nRomero came up with new ways to use Carmack's lighting engine, such as strobe lights. He programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms. After Romero's complex level designs started to cause problems with the engine, Carmack began to use binary space partitioning to quickly select the reduced portion of a level that the player could see at a given time. Taylor, along with programming other features, added cheat codes to aid in development and left them in for players.\n\nArt direction\nAdrian Carmack was the lead artist for Doom, with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. They designed the monsters to be \"nightmarish\", with graphics that were realistic and dark instead of staged or rendered. A mixed media approach was taken to create them. The artists sculpted models of some of the enemies and took pictures of them in stop motion from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game. The images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack. Adrian Carmack made clay models for a few demons and had Gregor Punchatz build latex and metal sculptures of the others. The weapons were made from combined parts of children's toys. The developers photographed themselves as well, using Cloud's arm for the marine's arm holding a gun, and Adrian's snakeskin boots and wounded knee for textures. The cover art was created by Don Ivan Punchatz, Gregor Punchatz's father, who worked from a short description of the game rather than detailed references. Romero was the body model used for cover; he posed during a photoshoot to demonstrate to the intended model what the pose should look like, and Punchatz used his photo.\nAs with Wolfenstein 3D, id hired composer Bobby Prince to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in techno and metal styles. Many tracks were directly inspired by songs by metal bands such as Alice in Chains and Pantera. Prince believed that ambient music would be more appropriate and produced numerous tracks in both styles in hope of convincing the team, and Romero incorporated both. Prince did not make music for specific levels, as they were composed before the levels were completed. Instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Prince created the sound effects based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon and adjusted them to match the completed animations. The monster sounds were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sounds to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sounds were playing at once. He also designed the sound effects to play on different frequencies from those used for the MIDI music, so they would clearly cut through the music.\n\nRelease\nId Software planned to self-publish Doom for DOS-based computers and set up a distribution system leading up to the release. Jay Wilbur, who had been hired as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of Doom. As id would make the most money from copies they sold directly to customers—up to 85% of the planned US$40 price—he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible. He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the game and bought only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he gave software retailers the option to sell copies of the first Doom episode at any price, in hopes of motivating customers to buy the full game directly from id. In 2004, John Carmack estimated that the total cost of development was less than US$1 million.\nThe team planned to release Doom in the third quarter of 1993 but ultimately needed more time. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop, with several employees sleeping at the office. Taylor said that the work gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id only gave a single press preview, to Computer Gaming World in June, to a glowing response, but had also released development updates to the public continuously throughout development on the nascent internet. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as anticipation built over the year. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours testing, the development team at id uploaded the first episode to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. The team was unable to connect to the FTP server at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where they planned to upload the game, since there were so many users already connected in anticipation of the release. The network administrator was forced to first increase the number of connections, and then kick off all users to make room. When the upload finished 30 minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university's network.\nWithin hours of Doom's release, university networks began banning Doom multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems. The morning after release, John Carmack quickly released a patch in response to complaints of network congestion from administrators, who still needed to implement Doom-specific rules to keep their networks from crashing from the load.\n\nPorts\nIn 1995, id created an expanded version of Doom for the retail market with a fourth episode of levels, which was published by GT Interactive as The Ultimate Doom. Doom has also been ported to numerous different platforms, independent from id Software. The first port of Doom was an unofficial port to Linux, released by id programmer Dave Taylor in 1994; it was hosted by id but not supported or made official. Microsoft attempted to hire id to port Doom to Windows in 1995 to promote Windows as a gaming platform, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates briefly considered buying the company. When id declined, Microsoft made its own licensed port, with a team led by Gabe Newell. One promotional video for Windows 95 had Gates digitally superimposed into the game.\nOther official ports of Doom were released for the 32X and Atari Jaguar in 1994, SNES and PlayStation in 1995, 3DO in 1996, Sega Saturn in 1997, Acorn Risc PC in 1998, Game Boy Advance in 2001, Xbox 360 in 2006, iOS in 2009, and Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Android in 2019, with the latter-most platforms (excluding Android) receiving a further expanded port alongside Doom II in 2024 along with ports for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Some of these became bestsellers even many years after the initial release. The ports did not all have the same content, with some having fewer levels, such as the 32X port created by John Carmack, which was released with only two-thirds of the game's levels in order to meet the console's launch date, while the PlayStation port includes The Ultimate Doom and Doom II.\nThe source code for Doom was released under a non-commercial license in 1997, and freely released under the GNU General Public License in 1999. Due to the release of its source code, Doom has been unofficially ported to numerous platforms. These ports include esoteric devices such as smart thermostats, pianos, and Doom itself, which led to variations of a long-running meme, \"Can it run Doom?\" and \"It runs Doom\".\n\nReception\nSales\nUpon its release in December 1993, Doom became an \"overnight phenomenon\". It was an immediate financial success for id, making a profit within a day after release. Although the company estimated that only 1% of shareware downloaders bought the full game, this was enough to generate initial daily revenue of US$100,000, selling in one day what Wolfenstein had sold in one month. By May 1994, Wilbur said that the game had sold over 65,000 copies, and estimated that the shareware version had been distributed over 1 million times. In 1995, Wilbur estimated the first-year sales as 140,000, while in 2002 Petersen said it had sold around 200,000 copies in its first year.\nBy late 1995, Doom was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95. According to PC Data, by April 1998 Doom's shareware edition had yielded 1.36 million units sold and US$8.74 million in revenue in the United States. This led PC Data to declare it the country's 4th-best-selling computer game since 1993. The Ultimate Doom sold over 780,000 units by September 1999, and all versions combined sold 3.5 million copies by the end of 1999. In addition to sales, an estimated six million people played the shareware version by 2002; other sources estimated in 2000 that 10–20 million people played Doom within 24 months of its launch.\n\nReviews\nDoom was highly praised in contemporaneous reviews. In April 1994, a few months after release, PC Gamer UK named it the third-best computer game of all time, claiming \"Doom has already done more to establish the PC's arcade clout than any other title in gaming history,\" and PC Gamer US named it the best computer game of all time that August. It won the Best Action Adventure award at Cybermania '94. GamesRadar UK named Doom Game of the Year in 1993 shortly after release, and Computer Gaming World and PC Gamer UK did the same the year after.\nReviewers heavily praised the single-player gameplay: Electronic Entertainment called it \"a skull-banging, palm-sweating, blood-pounding game\", while The Age said it was \"a technically superb and thrilling 3D adventure\". White Wolf's reviewer found it addictive, missing sleep and appointments to continue playing. PC Zone called it the best arcade game ever, and it and Computer Gaming World praised the variety of monsters and weapons. Computer Gaming World concluded that it was \"a virtuoso performance\". Other reviewers, while also praising the gameplay, commented on the lack of complexity: Computer and Video Games found it captivating and praised the variety and complexity of the level design, but called the overall gameplay repetitive, while Dragon similarly praised the fast gameplay and level design, but said that overall it lacked depth. Edge praised the graphics and levels but criticized the straightforward shooting gameplay. The review concluded: \"If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now, that would be interesting.\" The review attracted mockery and \"if only you could talk to these creatures\" became a running joke in video game culture. The multiplayer gameplay was praised: Computer Gaming World called it \"the most intense gaming experience available\", and Dragon called it \"the biggest adrenaline rush available on computers\". PC Zone named it as the best multiplayer game available, in addition to the best arcade game.\nThe 3D graphics and art style were praised by reviewers; Computer Gaming World called the graphics remarkable, while Edge said that it \"made serious advances in what people will expect of 3D graphics in future\", surpassing not only prior games but games that had yet to be released. Compute! and Electronic Games similarly called the graphics excellent and unlike any other game's. PC Zone, Dragon, Computer Gaming World, and Electronic Entertainment all praised the atmosphere and art direction, saying that the level design, lighting effects, and sound effects combined to create a \"claustrophobic\" and \"nightmarish experience\". Computer Gaming World also praised the music, as did The Mercury News, which called it as \"ominous as the scenario\".\n\nOther versions\nThe Ultimate Doom received mixed reviews upon its release in 1995, as in the review from PC Zone, which gave it a score of 90/100 for new players but 20/100 for anyone who had the original game. The reviewer viewed it as solely a level pack due to the lack of new features and compared it negatively to the hundreds of free fan-made levels available on the internet. Joystick disliked the limited amount of additional content and recommended it only to major fans or those who had not played it. Fusion reviewed the edition positively, praising the difficulty of the new levels, as did GameSpot, which reviewed it from the perspective of introducing the game to new players.\nThe first ports of Doom received comparable reviews to the original PC version. VideoGames, GamePro, and Computer and Video Games all gave the Jaguar version high scores, comparing it favorably with the PC version. GamePro and Computer and Video Games also rated the 32X version highly, though they noted that the graphics were worse and the game shorter than the PC or Jaguar versions. The 1995 ports received mixed reviews. The PlayStation version was rated highly by HobbyConsolas, GamePro, and Maximum, which praised the inclusion of Doom II and extra levels, and favorably compared it to other PlayStation shooter games. The SNES version, however, was noted for weaker graphics and unresponsive controls, though reviewers such as Computer and Video Games, GamePro, and Next Generation were split on awarding high or middling scores due to these faults. Later 1990s ports received worse reviews; the 3DO port was panned by GamePro and Maximum for having worse graphics, a smaller screen size, and less intelligent enemies than any previous version, and the Sega Saturn port also met with low reviews for poor graphics and low quality from Mean Machines and Sega Saturn Magazine.\n\nLegacy\nDoom has been termed \"inarguably the most important\" first-person shooter, as well as the \"father\" of the genre. Although not the first in the genre, it was the game with the greatest impact. Dan Pinchbeck in Doom: Scarydarkfast (2013) noted the direct influence of Doom's design choices on those of first-person and third-person shooter games two decades later, as influenced by the games released in the intervening years.\nDoom, and to a lesser extent Wolfenstein 3D, has been characterized as \"mark[ing] a turning point\" in the perception of video games in popular culture, with Doom and first-person shooters in general becoming the predominant perception of video games in media. Historians such as Tristan Donovan in Replay: The History of Video Games (2010) have termed it as causing a \"paradigm shift\", prompting the rise in popularity of 3D games, first-person shooters, licensed technology between developers, and support for game modifications. It helped spark the rise of both online multiplayer games and player-driven content generation, and popularized the business model of online distribution. In their book Dungeons & Dreamers: A Story of how Computer Games Created a Global Community in 2014, Brad King and John Borland claimed that Doom was one of the first widespread instances of an \"online collective virtual reality\", and did more than any other game to create a modern world of \"networked games and gamers\". PC Gamer proclaimed Doom the most influential game of all time in 2004, and in 2023 said its development was one of the most well-documented in the history of video games.\nIt has also been used in scholarly research since its release, including for machine learning, video game aesthetics and design, and the effects of video games on aggression, memory, and attention. In 2007 Doom was listed among the ten \"game canon\" video games selected for preservation by the Library of Congress, and in 2015 The Strong National Museum of Play inducted Doom to its World Video Game Hall of Fame as part of its initial set of games.\nDoom has continued to be included highly in lists of the best video games ever for nearly three decades since its release. In 1995, Next Generation said it was \"the most talked about PC game ever\". The PC version was ranked the 3rd best video game by Flux in 1995, and in 1996 was ranked fifth best and third most innovative by Computer Gaming World. In 2000, Doom was ranked as the second-best game ever by GameSpot. The following year, it was voted the number one game of all time in a poll among over 100 game developers and journalists conducted by GameSpy, and was ranked the sixth best game by Game Informer. GameTrailers ranked it the most \"breakthrough PC game\" in 2009 and Game Informer again ranked it the sixth-best game that same year. Doom has also been ranked among the best games of all time by GamesMaster, Hyper, The Independent, Entertainment Weekly, GamesTM, Jeuxvideo.com, Gamereactor, Time, Polygon, and The Times, among others, as recently as 2023.\n\nClones\nThe success of Doom led to dozens of new first-person shooter games. In 1998, PC Gamer declared it \"probably the most imitated game of all time\". These games were often referred to as \"Doom clones\", with \"first-person shooter\" only overtaking it as the name of the genre after a few years. As the \"first-person shooter\" genre label had not yet solidified at the time, Doom was described as a \"first person perspective adventure\" and \"atmospheric 3-D action game\".\nDoom clones ranged from close imitators to more innovative takes on the genre. Id Software licensed the Doom engine to several other companies, which resulted in several games similar to Doom, including Heretic (1994), Hexen: Beyond Heretic (1995), and Strife: Quest for the Sigil (1996). A Doom-based game called Chex Quest was released in 1996 by Ralston Foods as a promotion to increase cereal sales. Other games were inspired by Doom, if not rumored to be built by reverse engineering the game's engine, including LucasArts's Star Wars: Dark Forces (1995). Several other games termed Doom clones, such as PowerSlave (1996) and Duke Nukem 3D (1996), used the 1995 Build engine, a 2.5D engine inspired by Doom created by Ken Silverman with some consultation with John Carmack.\n\nSequel and franchise\nAfter completing Doom, id Software began working on a sequel using the same engine, Doom II, which was released to retail on October 10, 1994, ten months after the first game. GT Interactive had approached id before the release of Doom with plans to release a retail version of Doom and Doom II. Id chose to create the sequel as a set of episodes rather than a new game, allowing John Carmack and the other programmers to begin work on id's next game, Quake. Doom II was the United States' highest-selling software product of 1994 and sold more than 1.2 million copies within a year.\nDoom II was followed by an expansion pack from id, Master Levels for Doom II (1995), consisting of 21 commissioned levels and over 3000 user-created levels for Doom and Doom II. Two sets of Doom II levels by different amateur map-making teams were released together by id as the standalone game Final Doom (1996). Doom and Doom II were both included, along with previous id games, in the id Anthology compilation (1996). The Doom franchise has continued since the 1990s in several iterations and forms. The video game series includes Doom 3 (2004), Doom (2016), and Doom Eternal (2020), along with other spin-off video games. It additionally includes multiple novels, a comic book, board games, and two films: Doom (2005) and Doom: Annihilation (2019).\n\nControversies\nDoom was notorious for its high levels of graphic violence and satanic imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. Doom for the 32X was one of the first video games to be given a Mature 17+ rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board due to its violent gore and nature, while Doom II was the first. In Germany, shortly after its publication, Doom was classified as \"harmful to minors\" by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons and could not be sold to children or displayed where they could see it, which was only rescinded in 2011.\nDoom again sparked controversy in the United States when it was found that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, were avid players. While planning for the massacre, Harris said in his journal that the killing would be \"like playing Doom\". A rumor spread afterward that Harris had designed a custom Doom level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, which he used to practice for the shooting. Although Harris did design several custom Doom levels, which later became known as the \"Harris levels\", none were based on the school. Doom was dubbed a \"mass murder simulator\" by critic and Killology Research Group founder David Grossman.\nIn the earliest release versions, the level E1M4: Command Control contains a swastika-shaped structure, which was put in as a homage to Wolfenstein 3D. The swastika was removed in later versions, out of respect for a military veteran's request, according to Romero.\n\nCommunity\nDoom's popularity and innovations attracted a community that has persisted for decades since. The deathmatch mode was an important factor in its popularity. Doom was the first game to coin the term \"deathmatch\" and introduced multiplayer shooting battles to a wide audience. This led to a widespread community of players who had never experienced fast-paced multiplayer combat before.\nAnother popular aspect of Doom was the versatility of its WAD files, enabling user-generated levels and other game modifications. John Carmack and Romero had strongly advocated for mod support, overriding other id employees who were concerned about commercial and legal implications. Although WAD files exposed the game data, id provided no instructions for how they worked. Still, players were able to modify leaked alpha versions of the game, allowing them to release level editors within weeks of the game's release.\nOn January 26, 1994, university student Brendon Wyber led a group to create the first full level editor, the Doom Editor Utility, leading to the first custom level by Jeff Bird in March. It was followed by \"countless\" others, including many based on other franchises like Aliens and Star Wars total conversion mods, as well as DeHackEd, a patch editor first released in 1994 by Greg Lewis that allowed editing of the game engine. Soon after the first mods appeared, id CEO Wilbur posted legal terms to the company's website, allowing mod authors to charge money without any fees to id, while also absolving the company of responsibility or support.\nDoom mods were widely popular, earning favorable comparisons to the official level additions seen in The Ultimate Doom. Thousands of user-created levels were released in the first few years after the release; over 3000 such levels for Doom and Doom II were included in the official retail release Master Levels for Doom II (1995). WizardWorks released multiple collections of mods of Doom and Doom II under the name D!Zone. At least one mod creator, Tim Willits, was later hired at id Software. Mods have continued to be produced, with the community Cacowards awarding the best of each year. In 2016, Romero created two new Doom levels: E1M4b (\"Phobos Mission Control\") and E1M8b (\"Tech Gone Bad\"). In 2018, for the 25th anniversary of Doom, Romero announced Sigil, an unofficial fifth episode containing nine levels. It was released on May 22, 2019, for €6.66 with a soundtrack by Buckethead, and then released again for free on May 31 with a soundtrack by James Paddock. A physical release was later produced. A sixth episode, Sigil II, was released on the game's 30th anniversary, December 10, 2023, again for €6.66 for a digital copy with a soundtrack by Valient Thorr, as well as physical editions on floppy disk.\nIn addition to WAD files, Doom includes a feature that allowed players to record and play back gameplay using files called demos, or game replays. Although the concept of speedrunning a video game existed before Doom, its release coincided with a wave of popularity for speedrunning, amplified by the online communities built on the nascent Internet. Demos were lightweight files that could be shared more easily than video files on internet bulletin board systems at the time. As a result, Doom is credited with creating the video game speedrunning community. The speedrunning community for Doom has continued for decades. As recently as 2019, community members have broken records originally set in 1998. Doom has been termed as having \"one of the longest-running speedrunning communities\" as well as being \"the quintessential speedrunning game\".\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n\nDoom at MobyGames\nThe \"Official\" Doom FAQ\nSource code for Doom on GitHub",

        "content": "Bonnie is a Scottish given name and is sometimes used as a descriptive reference, as in the Scottish folk song, My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean or Bonnie Dundee about John Graham, 7th Laird of Claverhouse. It comes from the Scots language word \"bonnie\" (handsome, pretty, attractive), or the French bonne (good). That is in turn derived from the Latin word \"bonus\" (good). The name can also be used as a pet form of Bonita.\n\nUsage\nThe name has been in use, primarily in the Anglosphere, since the 1800s. It has been ranked among the 50 most popular names for newborn girls in the United Kingdom since 2020 and had been rising in popularity for British girls since the 1990s. It was among the 1,000 most used names for newborn girls in the United States between 1880 and 2003, reaching the height of popularity between 1928 and 1966, when it was ranked among the 100 most popular names for newborn American girls. It was also ranked among the 1,000 most popular names for newborn American boys between 1884 and 1953. The name then declined in popularity but has again risen in usage for girls in the United States in recent years and has been ranked among the 1,000 most popular names for newborn girls there since 2014. It has also been among the top 100 names for girls in Australia since 2014, in New Zealand since 2021, and in Sweden since 2019. In Canada, the name was among the 100 most popular names for girls between 1940 and 1973, but has since declined in usage.\nSpelling variants in use include Bonney, Bonni and Bonny. Elaborations of the name such as Bonnibel are also used. Other related names, also containing the word element bon, meaning good or attractive in various languages, include the Italian Bona and the Spanish Bonita. Some related given names or surnames include Bonaccorso, Bonaparte,  Bonaventura, Boniface, Bonilla, and Bueno.\nThe increase in usage of the name coincides with its use for characters in movie and television productions. It was the nickname used for Bonnie Blue Butler, the young daughter of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O’Hara in Margaret Mitchell’s 1935 novel Gone with the Wind and its 1939 film adaptation, because the child's eyes were said to be “as blue as the bonnie blue flag.” The name gained some notoriety via bank robbers  Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow and the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde made about the couple. The name was later used for Bonnie Bennett, a character in the television series The Vampire Diaries, which aired from 2009 to 2017, and for Bonnie Anderson, the toddler who inherits Andy's toys, in the \n2010 film Toy Story 3 and the 2019 sequel Toy Story 4.\n\nPeople named Bonnie\nWomen\nBonnie August (1947–2003), American fashion designer\nBonnie Bartlett (born 1929), American actress\nBipasha

        "streamer": "CURRY",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry",
        "content": "Curry is a dish with a sauce or gravy seasoned with spices, mainly derived from the interchange of Indian cuisine with European taste in food, starting with the Portuguese, followed by the Dutch and British, and then thoroughly internationalised. Many dishes that would be described as curries in English are found in the native cuisines of countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The English word is derived indirectly from some combination of Dravidian words such as the Tamil kaṟi (கறி) meaning 'sauce' or 'relish for rice'.\nA first step in the creation of curry was the arrival in India of spicy hot chili peppers, along with other ingredients such as tomatoes and potatoes, part of the Columbian exchange of plants between the Old World and the New World. During the British Raj, Anglo-Indian cuisine developed, leading to Hannah Glasse's 18th century recipe for \"currey the India way\" in England. Curry was then spread in the 19th century by indentured Indian sugar workers to the Caribbean, and by British traders to Japan. Further exchanges around the world made curry a fully international dish.\nMany types of curry exist in different countries. In Southeast Asia, curry often contains a spice paste and coconut milk. In India, the spices are fried in oil or ghee to create a paste; this may be combined with a water-based broth, or sometimes with milk or coconut milk. In China and Korea, curries are based on a commercial curry powder. Curry restaurants outside their native countries often adapt their cuisine to suit local tastes; for instance, Thai restaurants in the West sell red, yellow, and green curries with chili peppers of those colours, often combined with additional spices of the same colours. In Britain, curry has become a national dish, with some types adopted from India, others modified or wholly invented, as with chicken tikka masala, created by British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 20th century.\n\nEtymology\nThe word 'Curry' is \"ultimately derived\" from the Middle Tamil words Kaikaari or Kairee or \"it's shortened version Kaari meaning vegetables cooked with spices and a dash of coconut and curry leaves\".</ref> The Oxford Dictionaries suggest an origin specifically from Tamil. Other Dravidian languages, namely Malayalam (കറി kari, \"hot condiments; meats, vegetables\"), Middle Kannada and Kodava, have similar words. Kaṟi is described in a 17th century Portuguese cookbook who were trading with Tamil merchants along the Coromandel Coast of southeast India, becoming known as a \"spice blend ... called kari podi or curry powder\". The first appearance in its anglicised form (spelt currey) was in Hannah Glasse's 1747 book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy.\nThe term \"curry\" is not derived from the name of the curry tree, although some curries do include curry leaves among many other spices. The cookery writer Pat Chapman noted the similarity of the words Karahi or Kadai, an Indian cooking dish shaped like a wok, without adducing evidence. \"Curry\" is not related to the word cury in The Forme of Cury, a 1390s English cookbook; that term comes from the Middle French word cuire, meaning 'to cook'.\n\nCultural exchanges\nAncient spice trade in Asia\nAustronesian merchants in South East Asia traded spices along marine trade routes between South Asia (primarily the ports on the south eastern coast of India and Sri Lanka) and East Asia as far back at 5000 BCE. Archaeological evidence dating to 2600 BCE from Mohenjo-daro suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard, fennel, cumin, and tamarind pods with which they flavoured food. Black pepper is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE. The three basic ingredients of the spicy stew were ginger, garlic, and turmeric. Using starch grain analysis, archaeologists identified the residue of these spices in both skeletons and pottery shards from excavations in India, finding that turmeric and ginger were present. Sauces in India before Columbus could contain black pepper or long pepper to provide a little heat, but not chili, so they were not spicy hot by modern standards.\n\nEarly modern trade\nThe establishment of the Mughal Empire, in the early 16th century, influenced some curries, especially in the north. Another influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in Goa in 1510, resulting in the introduction of chili peppers, tomatoes and potatoes to India from the Americas, as a byproduct of the Columbian Exchange. The scholar of food culture Lizzie Collingham suggests that the Portuguese in Goa (in West India) heard and adopted words adopted into a local  language from the Dravidian words from South India, becoming caril or carree as transcribed by British travellers of the time. This adoption resulting eventually in curry's modern meaning of a dish, often spiced, in a sauce or gravy. In 1598, an English translation of a Dutch book about travel in the East Indies mentioned a \"somewhat sour\" broth called Carriel, eaten with rice. The later Dutch word karie was used in the Dutch East Indies from the 19th century; many Indians had by then migrated to Southeast Asia.\n\nBritish influence\nCurry was introduced to English cuisine from Anglo-Indian cooking in the 17th century, as spicy sauces were added to plain boiled and cooked meats. That cuisine was created in the British Raj when British wives or memsahibs instructed Indian cooks on the food they wanted, transforming many dishes in the process. Further, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when there were few British women in India, British men often lived with Indian mistresses, acquiring the local customs, language, and food. Curry was first served in coffee houses in Britain from 1809.\nIndian cooks in the 19th century prepared curries for their British masters simplified and adjusted to Anglo-Indian taste. For instance, a quarama from Lucknow contained (among other ingredients) ghee, yoghurt, cream, crushed almonds, cloves, cardamom, and saffron; whereas an 1869 Anglo-Indian quorema or korma, \"different in substance as well as name\", had no cream, almonds, or saffron, but it added the then-standard British curry spices, namely coriander, ginger, and black peppercorns. Curry, initially understood as \"an unfamiliar set of Indian stews and ragouts\", had become \"a dish in its own right, created for the British in India\". Collingham describes the resulting Anglo-Indian cuisine as \"eclectic\", \"pan-Indian\", \"lacking sophistication\", embodying a \"passion for garnishes\", and forming a \"coherent repertoire\"; but it was eaten only by the British. Collingham writes that \"The idea of a curry is, in fact, a concept that the Europeans imposed on India's food culture. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names... But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry.\nElsewhere in the 19th century, curry was carried to the Caribbean by Indian indentured workers in the British sugar industry.\n\nGlobalisation\nSince the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international fusion cuisine. Alan Davidson writes that curry's worldwide extension is a result of the Indian diaspora and globalisation, starting within the British Empire, and followed by economic migrants who brought Indian cuisine to many countries. In 1886, 咖喱 (Gālí) (Chinese pronunciation of \"curry\") appeared among the Chinese in Singapore. Malay Chinese people then most likely brought curry to China.\nIn India, spices are always freshly prepared for use in sauces. Derived from such mixtures (but not containing curry leaves), curry powder is a ready-prepared spice blend first sold by Indian merchants to European colonial traders. This was commercially available from the late 18th century, with brands such as Crosse & Blackwell and Sharwood's persisting to the present. British traders introduced the powder to Meiji era Japan, in the mid-19th century, where it became known as Japanese curry.\n\nTypes\nThere are many varieties of curry. The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural traditions and personal preferences. Such dishes have names such as dopiaza and rogan josh that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk and spice pastes, and is commonly eaten over rice. Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. A masala mixture is a combination of dried or dry-roasted spices commonly homemade for some curries.\nDry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume purée, sautéed crushed onion, or tomato purée. Curry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain.\n\nBy region\nUnited Kingdom\nCurry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town. Such is its popularity that it has frequently been called its \"adopted national dish\". It was estimated that in 2016 there were 12,000 curry houses, employing 100,000 people and with annual combined sales of approximately £4.2 billion. The food offered is cooked to British taste, but with increasing demand for authentic Indian styles. In 2001, chicken tikka masala was described by the British foreign secretary Robin Cook as \"a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.\" Its origin is not certain, but many sources attribute it to British Asians; some cite Glasgow as the city of origin. It may derive from butter chicken, popular in the north of India.\nCurries in Britain are derived partly from India and partly from invention in local Indian restaurants. They vary from mildly-spiced to extremely hot, with names that are to an extent standardised across the country, but are often unknown in India.\n\nSouth Asia\nMany Indian dishes are spicy. The spices chosen for a dish are freshly ground and then fried in hot oil or ghee to create a paste. \nThe content of the dish and style of preparation vary by region. The sauces are made with spices including black pepper, cardamom, chili peppers, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, fennel seed, mustard seed, and turmeric. As many as 15 spices may be used for a meat curry. The spices are sometimes fried whole, sometimes roasted, sometimes ground and mixed into a paste. The sauces are eaten with steamed rice or idli rice cakes in south India, and breads such as chapatis, roti, and naan in the north. \nThe popular rogan josh, for example, from Kashmiri cuisine, is a wet dish of lamb with a red gravy coloured by Kashmiri chillies and an extract of the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (mawal). Rice and curry is the staple dish of Sri Lanka.\n\nEast Asia\nJapanese curry is usually eaten as karē raisu – curry, rice, and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of a thick stew than a curry. British people brought curry from the Indian colony back to Britain and introduced it to Japan during the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation (sakoku), and curry in Japan was categorised as a Western dish. Its spread across the country is attributed to its use in the Japanese Army and Navy which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own recipes. The standard Japanese curry contains onions, carrots, potatoes, and sometimes celery, and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated apples or honey are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead.\nCurry spread to other regions of Asia. Curry powder is added to some dishes in the southern part of China. The curry powder sold in Chinese grocery stores is similar to Madras curry powder, but with the addition of star anise and cinnamon. The former Portuguese colony of Macau has its own culinary traditions and curry dishes, including Galinha à portuguesa (\"Portuguese-style chicken\") and curry crab. Portuguese sauce is a sauce flavoured with curry and thickened with coconut milk.\nCurry was popularized in Korean cuisine when Ottogi entered the Korean food industry with an imported curry powder in 1969. Korean curry powder contains spices including cardamom, chili, cinnamon, and turmeric.\nCurry tteokbokki is made of tteok (rice cakes), eomuk (fish cakes), eggs, vegetables, and gochujang, fermented red chili paste. As in India, chilis were brought to Korea by European traders. Spicy chili sauce then replaced the soy sauce formerly used in tteokbokki.\n\nSoutheast Asia\nIn Burmese cuisine, curries are broadly called hin. Burmese curries contains meat simmered in a curry paste containing onion, garlic, shrimp paste, tomato, and turmeric. Burmese curries are often mild, without chili, and somewhat oily.\nThai curries are called gaeng, and usually consist of meat, fish or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste. A few stir-fried Thai dishes use phong kari, an Indian style curry powder. In the West, Thai curries are often colour-coded green, yellow, and red, with green usually the mildest, red the hottest. Green curry is flavoured with green chili, coriander, kaffir lime, and basil; yellow, with yellow chili and turmeric; and red, with red chili.\nMalaysian Indian cuisine adapted curries (such as gulai, with coconut milk) via the region's Indian population, but it has become a staple among the Malay and Chinese populations there. Malaysian curries have many varieties, but are often flavoured with cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, chili peppers, and garlic.\nIndian Indonesian cuisine consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Indonesia. Curry in Indonesian is kari and in Javanese, kare. In Indonesian cuisine especially in Bandung, there is a dish called lontong kari, a combined of lontong and beef yellow curry soup. In Javanese cuisine, kare rajungan, blue swimmer crab curry has become a delicacy of Tuban Regency, East Java.\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, influenced by both Thai and Indian cooking, curry is known as cà ri. It is made with coconut milk, Madras curry powder with plenty of turmeric, and a variety of fresh ingredients such as coriander, lemongrass, and ginger.\nIn the Philippines, a dish that may have been directly inspired by Indian curries is the oxtail stew  kare-kare, possibly influenced by Sepoy expatriates during the brief British occupation of Manila (1762–1764), or indirectly via Southeast Asian spicy dishes. Ginataan are native dishes using coconut milk, which as in the case of Filipino chicken curry can be called 'curries' when curry powder is added.\n\nSouth Africa\nCurry spread to South Africa with the migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to the region in the colonial era. African curries, Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal curry, the Durban curry, Bunny chow, and roti rolls. South African curries appear to have been created in both KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, while others developed across the country over the late 20th and early 21st centuries to include ekasi, coloured, and Afrikaner varieties. Durban has the largest population of Indians outside of India in the world. Bunny chow or a \"set\", a South African standard, consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers by dipping pieces of the bread into it. 'Bunny chow' means 'Indian food', from Banian, an Indian. The method of serving the curry was created because apartheid forbade black people from eating in Indian restaurants; the loaves could speedily be taken away and eaten in the street.\n\nSee also\nThe Curry Club\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nCollingham, Lizzie (2006) [2005 (Chatto & Windus)].

        "content": "A ship  is a large vessel that travels the world's oceans and other navigable waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.\nThe word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged.\nThe earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE. In 2024, ships had a global cargo capacity of 2.4 billion tons, with the three largest classes being ships carrying dry bulk (43%), oil tankers (28%) and container ships (14%).\n\nNomenclature\nShips are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa. A ship is likely to have a full-time crew assigned. A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the inside because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy. American and British 19th century maritime law distinguished \"vessels\" from other watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.\nStarting around the middle of the 18th century, sailing vessels started to be categorised by their type of rig. (Previously they were described by their hull type – for example pink, cat.) Alongside the other rig types such as schooner and brig, the term \"ship\" referred to the rig type. In this sense, a ship is a vessel with three or more masts, all of which are square-rigged. For clarity, this may be referred to as a full-rigged ship or a vessel may be described as \"ship-rigged\". Alongside this rig-specific usage, \"ship\" continued to have the more general meaning of a large sea-going vessel. Often the meaning can only be determined by the context.: 71–73 : 2 \nSome large vessels are traditionally called boats, notably submarines.  Others include Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats, which may be designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.\nIn most maritime traditions ships have individual names, and modern ships may belong to a ship class often named after its first ship.\nIn many documents the ship name is introduced with a ship prefix being an abbreviation of the ship class, for example \"MS\" (motor ship) or \"SV\" (sailing vessel), making it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual names in a text.\n\"Ship\" (along with \"nation\") is an English word that has retained a female grammatical gender in some usages, which allows it sometimes to be referred to as a \"she\" without being of female natural gender.\n\nHistory\nFor most of history, transport by ship – provided there is a feasible route –  has generally been cheaper, safer and faster than making the same journey on land. Only the coming of railways in the middle of the 19th century and the growth of commercial aviation in the second half of the 20th century have changed this principle. This applied equally to sea crossings, coastal voyages and use of rivers and lakes.: 15 \nExamples of the consequences of this include the large grain trade in the Mediterranean during the classical period. Cities such as Rome were totally reliant on the delivery by sailing and human powered (oars) ships of the large amounts of grain needed. It has been estimated that it cost less for a sailing ship of the Roman Empire to carry grain the length of the Mediterranean than to move the same amount 15 miles by road. Rome consumed about 150,000 tons of Egyptian grain each year over the first three centuries AD.: 297 : 147 \nUntil recently, it was generally the case that ships were the most advanced representations of the technology available to the societies that produced them.: 1\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nAsian developments\nThe earliest attestations of ships in maritime transport in Mesopotamia are model ships, which date back to the 4th millennium BC. In archaic texts in Uruk, Sumer, the ideogram for \"ship\" is attested, but in the inscriptions of the kings of Lagash, ships were first mentioned in connection to maritime trade and naval warfare at around 2500–2350 BCE.\nAustronesian peoples originated in what is now Taiwan. From here, they took part in the Austronesian Expansion. Their distinctive maritime technology was integral to this movement and included catamarans and outriggers. It has been suggested that they had sails some time before 2000 BCE.: 144  Their crab claw sails enabled them to sail for vast distances in open ocean.  From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.\nAustronesian sails were made from woven leaves, usually from pandan plants. These were complemented by paddlers, who usually positioned themselves on platforms on the outriggers in the larger boats. Austronesian ships ranged in complexity from simple dugout canoes with outriggers or lashed together to large edge-pegged plank-built boats built around a keel made from a dugout canoe. Their designs were unique, evolving from ancient rafts to the characteristic double-hulled, single-outrigger, and double-outrigger designs of Austronesian ships.\nIn the 2nd century AD, people from the Indonesian archipelago already made large ships measuring over 50 m long and standing 4–7 m out of the water. They could carry 600–1000 people and 250–1000 ton cargo. These ships were known as kunlun bo or k'unlun po (崑崙舶, lit. \"ship of the Kunlun people\") by the Chinese, and kolandiaphonta by the Greeks. They had 4–7 masts and were able to sail against the wind due to the usage of tanja sails. These ships may have reached as far as Ghana.: 41 : 262 : 347  In the 11th century, a new type of ship called djong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali.: 222, 230, 267 : 82  This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and treenails, unlike the kunlun bo which used vegetal fibres for lashings.: 138 \nIn China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC). By the Han dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. Centre-line rudders, mounted at the stern, started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, these early Chinese ships were fluvial (riverine), and were not seaworthy.: 20  The Chinese only acquired sea-going ship technologies in the 10th-century AD Song dynasty after contact with Southeast Asian k'un-lun po trading ships, leading to the development of the junks.: 20–21\n\nMediterranean developments\nThe earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians:  \"During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries BC, the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country.\" Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded (2613 BC) to a ship being referred to by name.\nThe ancient Egyptians were perfectly at ease building sailboats. A remarkable example of their shipbuilding skills was the Khufu ship, a vessel 143 feet (44 m) in length entombed at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2500 BC and found intact in 1954.\nThe oldest discovered sea faring hulled boat is the Late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey, dating back to 1300 BC.\nBy 1200 B.C., the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. In world maritime history, declares Richard Woodman, they are recognized as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the architects of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\"\n\n14th through the 18th centuries\nAsian developments\nAt this time, ships were developing in Asia in much the same way as Europe. Japan used defensive naval techniques in the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1281. It is likely that the Mongols of the time took advantage of both European and Asian shipbuilding techniques. During the 15th century, China's Ming dynasty assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the diplomatic and power projection voyages of Zheng He. Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the world's first iron-clads, \"Tekkōsen\" (鉄甲船), literally meaning \"iron ships\", was also developed. In Japan, during the Sengoku era from the 15th century to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the atakebune. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the Joseon era, \"Geobukseon\"(거북선), was developed.\nThe empire of Majapahit used large ships called jong, built in northern Java, for transporting troops overseas.: 115  The jongs were transport ships which could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people, 28.99–88.56 meter in length.: 60–62  The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350.\n\nEurope\nUntil the late 13th or early 14th century, European shipbuilding had two separate traditions. In Northern Europe clinker construction predominated. In this, the hull planks are fastened together in an overlapping manner. This is a \"shell first\" construction technique, with the hull shape being defined by the shaping and fitting of the hull planks. The reinforcing frames (or ribs) are fitted after the planks.: 65–66  Clinker construction in this era usually used planks that were cleft (split radially from the log) and could be made thinner and stronger per unit of thickness than the sawn logs, thanks to preserving the radial integrity of the grain.: 53–54  \nAn exception to clinker construction in the Northern European tradition is the bottom planking of the cog. Here, the hull planks are not joined to each other and are laid flush (not overlapped). They are held together by fastening to the frames but this is done after the shaping and fitting of these planks. Therefore, this is another case of a \"shell first\" construction technique.: 65–66 \nThese Northern European ships were rigged with a single mast setting a square sail. They were steered by rudders hung on the sternpost.: 69 \nIn contrast, the ship-building tradition of the Mediterranean was of carvel construction – the fitting of the hull planking to the frames of the hull. Depending on the precise detail of this method, it may be characterised as either \"frame first\" or \"frame-led\". In either variant, during construction, the hull shape is determined by the frames, not the planking. The hull planks are not fastened to each other, only to the frames.: 69 \nThese Mediterranean ships were rigged with lateen sails on one or more masts (depending on the size of the vessel) and were steered with a side rudder. They are often referred to as \"round ships\".: 68-69 \nCrucially, the Mediterranean and Northern European traditions merged. Cogs are known to have travelled to the Mediterranean in the 12th and 13th centuries. Some aspects of their designs were being copied by Mediterranean ship-builders early in the 14th century. Iconography shows square sails being used on the mainmast but a lateen on the mizzen, and a sternpost hung rudder replacing the side rudder. The name for this type of vessel was \"coche\" or, for a larger example, \"carrack\". Some of these new Mediterranean types travelled to Northern European waters and, in the first two decades of the 15th century, a few were captured by the English, two of which had previously been under charter to the French. The two-masted rig started to be copied immediately, but at this stage on a clinker hull. The adoption of carvel hulls had to wait until sufficient shipwrights with appropriate skills could be hired, but by late in the 1430s, there were instances of carvel ships being built in Northern Europe, and in increasing numbers over the rest of the century.: 69-72 \nThis hybridisation of Mediterranean and Northern European ship types created the full-rigged ship, a three-masted vessel with a square-rigged foremast and mainmast and a lateen sail on the mizzen. This provided most of the ships used in the Age of Discovery, being able to carry sufficient stores for a long voyage and with a rig suited to the open ocean. Over the next four hundred years, steady evolution and development, from the starting point of the carrack, gave types such as the galleon, fluit, East Indiaman, ordinary cargo ships, warships, clippers and many more, all based on this three-masted square-rigged type.: 29, passim \nThe transition from clinker to carvel construction facilitated the use of artillery at sea since the internal framing of the hull could be made strong enough to accommodate the weight of guns. It was easier to fit gunports in a carvel hull. As vessels became larger and the demand for ship-building timber affected the size of trees available, clinker construction became limited by the difficulty of finding large enough logs from which to cleave planks. Nonetheless, some clinker vessels approached the size of contemporary carracks. Before the adoption of carvel construction, the increasing size of clinker-built vessels necessitated greater amounts of internal framing of their hulls for strength – something that somewhat lessened the conceptual change to the new technique.: 55, 58–60\n\n19th and 20th centuries: specialization and modernization\nParallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.\nMaritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, the French Navy began to develop a new type of vessel known as a ship of the line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were 56 metres (184 ft) long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and 40 kilometres (25 mi) of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers. During the 19th century the Royal Navy enforced a ban on the slave trade, acted to suppress piracy, and continued to map the world. Ships and their owners grew with the 19th century Industrial Revolution across Europe and North America, leading to increased numbers of oceangoing ships, as well as other coastal and canal based vessels.\nThrough more than half of the 19th century and into the early years of the 20th century, steam ships coexisted with sailing vessels. Initially, steam was only viable on shorter routes, typically transporting passengers who could afford higher fares and mail. Steam went through many developmental steps that gave greater fuel efficiency, thereby increasingly making steamships commercially competitive with sail. Screw propulsion, which relied, among other things, on the invention of an effective stern gland for the propeller shaft, worked better than paddle wheels. Higher boiler pressures of 60 pounds per square inch (410 kPa) powering compound engines, were introduced in 1865, making long-distance steam cargo vessels commercially viable on the route from England to China – even before the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Within a few years, steam had replaced many of the sailing ships that had served this route. Even greater fuel efficiency was obtained with triple-expansion steam engines – but this had to wait for higher quality steel to be available to make boilers running at 125 pounds per square inch (860 kPa) in SS Aberdeen (1881). By this point virtually all routes could be served competitively by steamships. Sail continued with some cargoes, where low costs were more important to the shipper than a predictable and rapid journey time.: 99–100, passim : 106–111 : 89 \nThe Second Industrial Revolution in particular led to new mechanical methods of propulsion, and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. These led to the development of long-distance commercial ships and Ocean liners, as well as technological changes including the Marine steam engine, screw propellers, triple expansion engines and others. Factors included the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created more specialized ships and other maritime vessels. Ship types built for entirely new functions that appeared by the 20th century included research ships, offshore support vessels (OSVs), Floating production storage and offloading (FPSOs), Pipe and cable laying ships, drill ships and Survey vessels.\nThe late 20th century saw changes to ships that included the decline of ocean liners as air travel increased. The rise of container ships from the 1960s onwards dramatically changed the nature of commercial merchant shipping, as containerization led to larger ship sizes, dedicated container routes and the decline of general cargo vessels as well as tramp steaming. The late 20th century also saw a rise in cruise ships for tourism around the world.\n\n21st century\nIn 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion deadweight tons. Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. By 2019, the world's fleet included 51,684 commercial vessels with gross tonnage of more than 1,000 tons, totaling 1.96 billion tons.  Such ships carried 11 billion tons of cargo in 2018, a sum that grew by 2.7% over the previous year.  In terms of tonnage, 29% of ships were tankers, 43% are bulk carriers, 13% container ships and 15% were other types.\nIn 2008, there were 1,240 warships operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as patrol boats. The United States accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, Russia 1.35 million tons, the United Kingdom 504,660 tons and China 402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two world wars, the Cold War, and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The world's major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands and the United States in Iraq.\nThe size of the world's fishing fleet is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion. Fishing vessels can be found in most seaside villages in the world. As of 2004, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated 4 million fishing vessels were operating worldwide.  The same study estimated that the world's 29 million fishermen caught 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 long tons; 94,600,000 short tons) of fish and shellfish that year.\nIn 2023, the number of ships globally grew by 3.4%. In 2024, new ships are increasingly being built with alternative fuel capability to increase sustainability and reduce carbon emissions. Alternative ship fuels include LNG, LPG, methanol, biofuel, ammonia and hydrogen among others.\nAs of 2024, wind power for ships had received renewed interest for its potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTypes of ships\nBecause ships are constructed using the principles of naval architecture that require same structural components, their classification is based on their function such as that suggested by Paulet and Presles, which requires modification of the components. The categories accepted in general by naval architects are:\n\nHigh-speed craft – Multihulls including wave piercers, small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH), surface effect ships and hovercraft, hydrofoil, wing in ground effect craft (WIG).\nOff shore oil vessels – Platform supply vessels, pipe layers, accommodation and crane barges, non and semi-submersible drilling rigs, drill ships, production platforms, floating production storage and offloading units.\nFishing vessels\nMotorised fishing trawlers, trap setters, seiners, longliners, trollers & factory ships.\nTraditional sailing and rowed fishing vessels and boats used for handline fishing\nHarbour work craft\nCable layers\nTugboats, dredgers, salvage vessels, tenders, pilot boats.\nFloating dry docks, crane vessels, lighterships.\nDry cargo ships – tramp freighters, bulk carriers, cargo liners, container vessels, barge carriers, Ro-Ro ships, refrigerated cargo ships, timber carriers, livestock carriers & light vehicle carriers.\nLiquid cargo ships – tankers, oil tankers, liquefied gas carriers, LNG carriers, chemical carriers.\nPassenger ships\nLiners, cruise and special trade passenger (STP) ships\nCross-channel, coastal and harbour ferries\nLuxury and cruising yachts and superyachts\nSail training and sailing ships\nGalleys – biremes, triremes and quinquiremes\nRecreational boats and craft – rowed, masted and motorised craft\nSpecial-purpose vessels – weather and research vessels, deep sea survey vessels, and icebreakers.\nSubmarines – watercraft capable of independent operation underwater.\nNaval ships\nWarships – aircraft carriers, amphibious warfare ships, battleships, battlecruisers, coastal defence ships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, patrol ships, minesweepers, etc.\nAuxiliary ships – ammunition ships, replenishment oilers, repair ships, storeships, troopships, etc.\nHospital ships\nSome of these are discussed in the following sections.\n\nInland vessels\nFreshwater shipping may occur on lakes, rivers and canals. Ships designed for those body of waters may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the Danube, Mississippi, Rhine, Yangtze and Amazon Rivers, and the Great Lakes.\n\nGreat Lakes\nLake freighters, also called lakers, are cargo vessels that ply the Great Lakes. The most well-known is SS Edmund Fitzgerald, the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called \"salties\". Because of their additional beam, very large salties are never seen inland of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Because the smallest of the Soo Locks is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, \"topping off\" when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the Welland Canal that bypasses the Niagara River.\nSince the freshwater lakes are less corrosive to ships than the salt water of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50 years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20 years of age.\nSS St. Marys Challenger, built in 1906 as William P Snyder, was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, E.M. Ford, built in 1898 as Presque Isle, was sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996. As of 2007 E.M. Ford was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nMerchant ship\nMerchant ships are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing vessels, cargo ships, passenger ships, and special-purpose ships. The UNCTAD review of maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and \"other ships\", which includes \"liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo\". General cargo ships include \"multi-purpose and project vessels and roll-on/roll-off cargo\".\nModern commercial vessels are typically powered by a single propeller driven by a diesel or, less usually, gas turbine engine., but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use pump-jet engines. Most commercial vessels such as container ships, have full hull-forms (higher Block coefficients) to maximize cargo capacity. Merchant ships and fishing vessels are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass or wood on smaller vessels.  Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a sea captain, with deck officers and engine officers on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard research vessels.\nFishing boats are generally small, often little more than 30 meters (98 ft) but up to 100 metres (330 ft) for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 long tons; 94,600,000 short tons) of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10,700,000 tonnes (10,500,000 long tons; 11,800,000 short tons).  That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna.  Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.\nCargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general cargo ship in break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as oil tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and gas carriers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.\nPassenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large cruise ships. This type of vessel includes ferries, which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; ocean liners, which carry passengers from one place to another; and cruise ships, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. Riverboats and inland ferries are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.\n\nFishing vessels are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world's fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels.  Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels.  Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars.  More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.\n\nSpecial purpose vessels\nA weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in marine weather forecasting. Surface weather observations were taken hourly, and four radiosonde releases occurred daily.  It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights.  Proposed as early as 1927 by the aviation community, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by the United States. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine.\nThe weather ship crews were normally at sea for three weeks at a time, returning to port for 10-day stretches.  Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like other ships tended to for safety reasons.  They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones.  The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987.  Beginning in the 1970s, their role became largely superseded by weather buoys due to the ships' significant cost.  The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1990. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M (\"Mike\"), which was put out of operation on 1 January 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.\n\nNaval vessels\nNaval ships are diverse in types of vessel. They include: surface warships, submarines, and auxiliary ships.\nModern warships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines and amphibious warfare ships. The distinctions among cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes are not codified; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies. Battleships were used during the Second World War and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of carrier-borne aircraft and guided missiles.\nMost military submarines are either attack submarines or ballistic missile submarines. Until the end of World War II the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of submarine-launched nuclear and cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster munitions to nuclear weapons.\nMost navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as minesweepers, patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, replenishment ships, and hospital ships which are designated medical treatment facilities.\nFast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability.  They also usually have advanced marine electronics and communication systems, as well as weapons.\n\nArchitecture\nSome components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it's a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.\n\nHull\nFor a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship's hull. There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of America's Cup sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of catamarans, or three in the case of trimarans. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.\nHulls have several elements. The bow is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a ship's rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.\nHulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.\nOlder ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and composite materials are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with concrete hulls.\n\nPropulsion systems\nPropulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, which was used even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and wingsails have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\nMechanical propulsion systems generally consist of a motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, an impeller or wave propulsion fins. Steam engines were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by two-stroke or four-stroke diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, and there have been attempts to use them to power commercial vessels (see NS Savannah).\nIn addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with transverse thrusters for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a diesel–electric powertrain in which the propeller is turned by an electric motor powered by the ship's generators.\nAs environmental sustainability becomes a paramount concern, the maritime industry is exploring cleaner propulsion technologies. Alternatives like LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), ammonia, and hydrogen are emerging as viable options. LPG is already utilized as fuel for long-distance shipping, offering a cleaner option with a lower carbon footprint. Meanwhile, hydrogen and ammonia technologies are in development stages for long-haul applications, promising even more significant reductions in emissions and a step closer to achieving carbon-neutral shipping.\n\nSteering systems\nFor ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some paddles, steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a tiller, manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. Ducted propellers are sometimes used for steering.\nSome propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the outboard motor, the bow thruster, and the azimuth thruster.\n\nHolds, compartments, and the superstructure\nLarger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate berthings and heads are found on sailboats over about 25 feet (7.6 m). Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a galley, and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship's trim and modify its stability.\nSuperstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship's stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.\n\nEquipment\nShipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship's era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:\n\nMasts can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law.\nGround tackle comprises the anchor, its chain or cable, and connecting fittings.\nCargo equipment such as cranes and cargo booms may be used to load and unload cargo and ship's stores.\nSafety equipment such as lifeboats, liferafts, and survival suits are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.\n\nDesign considerations\nHydrostatics\nShips float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, so that the downwards force of gravity equals the upward force of buoyancy. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel's mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its beam (width). A vessel's stability is considered in both this hydrostatic sense as well as a hydrodynamic sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.\n\nHydrodynamics\nThe advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and wave making resistance. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. Antifouling paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the bulbous bow assist in decreasing wave resistance.\nA simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude. Since the water is not able to \"get out of the way of the hull fast enough\", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.\nThis hull speed is found by the formula:\n\nor, in metric units:\n\nwhere L is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.\nWhen the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its bow wave, and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.\nFor large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of computational fluid dynamics.\nVessels are also subject to ocean surface waves and sea swell as well as effects of wind and weather. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as fin stabilizers. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.\n\nLifecycle\nA ship will pass through several stages during its career. The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the shipowners, operators, designers and the shipyard. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from shipwrecks to service as a museum ship to the scrapyard.\n\nDesign\nA vessel's design starts with a specification, which a naval architect uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship's propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship's design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.\nThe designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.\nAs environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be disassembled or disposed easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.\n\nConstruction\nShip construction takes place in a shipyard, and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate Hermione, to more than 10 years for an aircraft carrier. During World War II, the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for Liberty Ships went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.\nHull materials and vessel size play a large part in determining the method of construction. The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.\nGenerally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about 30 meters (98 ft), by the laying of the keel. This is done in a drydock or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.\nOnce completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. Ship launching is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a Vendée Globe class sailboat. A 25 meters (82 ft) trawler may cost $2.5 million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50 million. A ship's cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, general cargo ship will cost $20 million, a Panamax-sized bulk carrier around $35 million, a supertanker around $105 million and a large LNG carrier nearly $200 million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a Seawolf-class submarine costs around $2 billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5 billion.\nIn 2023, the majority of the world's ships (95% of global output) were built in just three countries: China, South Korea and Japan.\n\nRepair and conversion\nShips undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.\nMost ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a drydock at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, sandblasting and repainting the hull, and replacing sacrificial anodes used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.\nSome vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: oil tankers are often converted into floating production storage and offloading units.\n\nEnd of service\nMost ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30 years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40 years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100 years.\nAs ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be scuttled at sea or scrapped by shipbreakers. Ships can also be used as museum ships, or expended to construct breakwaters or artificial reefs.\nMany ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, grounding, or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during World War II.\n\nMeasuring ships\nOne can measure ships in terms of length overall, length between perpendiculars, length of the ship at the waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), draft (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and tonnage. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.\n\nIn Britain until Samuel Plimsoll's Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in jail. Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some engineers to derive a fairly simple formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship's hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the \"Plimsoll mark\", \"freeboard mark\" or \"load line mark\", exists on ships' sides, and consists of a circle with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the \"ladder\" of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. These are called the \"load lines\" in the marine industry.\n\nShip pollution\nShip pollution is the pollution of air and water by shipping. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world's oceans and waterways as globalization continues. It is expected that \"shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\" Because of increased traffic in ocean ports, pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects biodiversity, climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30 years.\n\nOil spills\nOil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.\nBy the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry 2 million barrels (318,000 m3) of crude oil, or 84,000,000 US gallons (69,940,000 imp gal; 318,000,000 L). This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known Exxon Valdez incident. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped 10,800,000 US gallons (8,993,000 imp gal; 40,880,000 L) of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000 seabirds, about 1,000 sea otters, and immense numbers of fish were killed.\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974. According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil.  91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7 tons per spill. Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 tons.\nFollowing the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be double-hulled by 2015. Following the sinkings of Erika (1999) and Prestige (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of \"serious negligence\".\n\nBallast water\nWhen a large vessel such as a container ship or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.\nOne of the problems with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless planktonic organism . Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species of comb jelly that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Valdés peninsula in Argentina along the Atlantic coast, has caused notable damage in the Black Sea. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the comb jelly shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. \"The anchovy catch fell from 204,000 tonnes (225,000 short tons; 201,000 long tons) in 1984 to 200 tonnes (220 short tons; 197 long tons) in 1993; sprat from 24,600 tonnes (27,100 short tons; 24,200 long tons) in 1984 to 12,000 tonnes (13,200 short tons; 11,800 long tons) in 1993; horse mackerel from 4,000 tonnes (4,410 short tons; 3,940 long tons) in 1984 to zero in 1993.\" Now that the comb jellies have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem. Recently the comb jellies have been discovered in the Caspian Sea. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. \"On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137 billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.\"\nBallast and bilge discharge from ships can also spread human pathogens and other harmful diseases and toxins potentially causing health issues for humans and marine life alike. Discharges into coastal waters, along with other sources of marine pollution, have the potential to be toxic to marine plants, animals, and microorganisms, causing alterations such as changes in growth, disruption of hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression of the immune system, and disorders resulting in cancer, tumors, and genetic abnormalities or even death.\n\nExhaust emissions\nExhaust emissions from ships are considered to be a significant source of air pollution. \"Seagoing vessels are responsible for an estimated 14 percent of emissions of nitrogen from fossil fuels and 16 percent of the emissions of sulfur from petroleum uses into the atmosphere.\" In Europe ships make up a large percentage of the sulfur introduced to the air, \"as much sulfur as all the cars, lorries and factories in Europe put together\". \"By 2010, up to 40% of air pollution over land could come from ships.\" Sulfur in the air creates acid rain which damages crops and buildings. When inhaled, sulfur is known to cause respiratory problems and increase the risk of a heart attack.\n\nShip breaking\nShip breaking or ship demolition is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for scrap recycling, with the hulls being discarded in ship graveyards. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.\n\nIn addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in developed countries. Asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers' health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.\nAside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major environmental concern. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no environmental law, enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.\n\nSee also\nModel ships\n\nShip model\nShip model basin\nShip replica\nLists\n\nShip sizes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\n\n\n=== Sources ===",
