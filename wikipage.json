        "content": "Marc Robert Lamont, better known as Caedrel, is a British professional League of Legends coach, currently head coach for Los Ratones. He is also a content creator, streamer, retired professional League of Legends player and sports commentator for Riot Games. Known for holding co-streams of major professional League of Legends regions and international competitions, Caedrel is considered as one of the biggest streamers within the game's community, mostly known for his in-depth gameplay analysis and familiarity.\nOn the livestreaming platform Twitch, Caedrel operates the biggest channel on the League of Legends category and constantly ranks among the top streamers in the English language according to Streams Charts.\nCaedrel is also known for his time as a caster in the League of Legends EMEA Championship and has cast several major international tournaments, including the final of the 2022 League of Legends World Championship.\n\nProfessional career\nCaedrel began his professional career in May 2015, joining xPerience eSports Club as their midlaner until July of the same year. Following a brief stint with now-defunct Team ALTERNATE (then known as ALTERNATE aTTaX), he joined Giants Gaming as their substitute midlaner until the end of the year. In January 2016, Lamont signed with Renegades Banditos in the European Challenger Series. After the disbandment of Renegades' League of Legends roster in May 2016 due to several issues, Caedrel then joined multiple teams for the rest of the year.\n\nJoining H2k and promotion to EU LCS (2017‚Äì2018)\nIn 2017, Caedrel joined H2k-Gaming as a substitute. He would then return to the team as part of their main roster after a four-month stint with Schalke 04 Esports where they would place second in the EUCS Summer Split. This period was where Caedrel would also earn his first promotion to the European League Championship Series (now League of Legends EMEA Championship) with a 3‚Äì0 win over Ninjas in Pyjamas on 25 August 2017. The following year, Caedrel returned to H2k, now as a jungler, and participated in his first EU LCS split, where they would finish with an 8‚Äì10 win-loss record, make the quarterfinals where they were defeated by Team Vitality in five games. However, he would spend most of this period as a substitute. In the Summer Split, H2k would finish with a 2‚Äì16 record, with two of those wins featuring Caedrel as the starting jungler.\n\nExcel Esports and retirement from professional play (2019‚Äì2020)\nOn 2 December 2018, Caedrel joined Excel Esports as their main jungler, where they would finish 9th and 10th in the Spring and Summer Splits, respectively, during the 2019 LEC season. Following another disappointing season in 2020, Caedrel announced his retirement from professional play through a video posted to Twitter (now X).\n\nPost-professional play\nCasting and analyst desk (2020‚Äì2023)\nWhilst still being a player, Caedrel had his first game as a caster in a game between his former team Schalke 04 Esports and Fnatic on 31 January 2020. He also served as a caster and analyst in that year's European Masters, LEC Summer Split Playoffs, and the play-in stage of the 2020 League of Legends World Championship. These casting stints were met with widespread praise, leading to his selection as an on-air talent for the 2021 LEC season.\nCaedrel was part of the casting and analyst lineup for three LEC seasons (2021, 2022, and 2023). He also cast the 2021 and 2022 editions of the League of Legends World Championship and the 2021 Mid-Season Invitational. Caedrel cast his final international game during the 2022 edition of Worlds, when he was selected as one of the casters for the tournament's final at the Chase Center in San Francisco, United States alongside Clayton \"CaptainFlowers\" Raines and Sam \"Kobe\" Hartman-Kenzler. In the fifth and deciding game of the said matchup between T1 and DRX, Caedrel gained the attention of viewers for his reaction to T1's Lee \"Gumayusi\" Min-hyeong's steal of the Baron Nashor using the Varus, through an utterance of an expletive and with the phrase, \"Guma can he steal it\". The phrase has since become synonymous with him and the said game.\nFollowing the 2023 LEC season, Caedrel announced his retirement from casting to focus on streaming full-time, with the season finals between G2 Esports and Fnatic at the Sud de France Arena in Montpellier, France being his last as a caster and analyst.\n\nFull-time streaming and other ventures (2023‚Äìpresent)\nDuring his time as a pro-player and caster, Caedrel was already venturing into streaming on his Twitch channel, but the 2023 League of Legends World Championship in South Korea marked his first tournament as a full-time streamer. It was during this tournament where three videos on his YouTube channel would reach at least one million views as of October 2024. His highest viewed video as of the said time was 2 million for a video of his co-stream highlights of the tournament's semifinal matchup between T1 and JD Gaming. Caedrel was also selected as an onsite co-streamer for the tournament's finals between T1 and Weibo Gaming at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, serving as one of two co-streamers from the EMEA region alongside Ibai Llanos.\nCaedrel joined Fnatic in January 2024 to be one of their content creators and streamers, where he also became their official co-streamer during the 2024 LEC season. He parted ways with the organization on 14 December 2024. \nIn 2024, Caedrel co-streamed the Spring and Summer Splits of the LCK, LPL, LEC, & LCS (now called the LTA North), the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational and the 2024 League of Legends World Championship. Co-streaming the latter tournament virtually and in-person on three occassions, including the Final between Bilibili Gaming and T1 at The O2 Arena in London, he was both the most-watched co-streamer during the tournament with a peak viewership of 372 thousand, which is the highest in his channel's history, and the most-watched English language stream in the entire World Championship. Caedrel also achieved the highest number of hours watched for a co-streamer in the event at 17.02 million, making up 19.4% of the total hours watched of the entire tournament at 87.5 million, taking into account the official Riot Games stream and other co-streams.\nOn 31 October 2024, two days before the 2024 World Championship Final, Caedrel officially reached one million followers on his Twitch channel. \nFor the 2025 competitive calendar, Caedrel currently co-streams the 2025 LCK and LEC seasons, as well as select games from the 2025 LPL season. He is also expected to co-stream all three international tournaments, namely First Stand, MSI, and the World Championship.\n\nLeague Awards\nOn 12 June 2024, Caedrel and his former on-air broadcast colleague Eefje \"Sjokz\" Depoortere announced the creation of the \"League Awards,\" a League of Legends-oriented awards show aimed at celebrating the game's esports scene and recognizing outstanding players during each competitive season. The first edition of the event took place on 5 December 2024 in Berlin, Germany, with Caedrel and Sjokz serving as hosts.\n\nLos Ratones\nDuring a livestream on his Twitch channel on 1 June 2024, Caedrel first brought up the idea of competing in the Northern League of Legends Championship (NLC) alongside Tim \"Nemesis\" Lipov≈°ek and Simon \"Thebausffs\" Hofverberg. Five months later, Caedrel announced on 15 November 2024 that he would be starting a professional team called \"Los Ratones\", with Nemesis and Thebausffs joining the organization as its midlaner and toplaner, respectively. They would be joined by jungler Veljko \"Velja\" ƒåamd≈æiƒá, ADC Ju≈° \"Crownie\" Maru≈°iƒç, and support Carl Martin Erik \"Rekkles\" Larsson, with Caedrel serving as head coach of the team. \nThe name, \"Los Ratones\" first emerged in the \"CaedrelPlays\" YouTube Channel on 17 September 2023 in a first of a series of videos of him playing \"Teamfight Manager,\" an esports manager game available on digital distribution platform Steam, when he typed \"Los Ratones\" as the name for his team on the game. On 2 January 2025, it was announced that the team would be competing in the Northern League of Legends Championship (NLC).\n\nAwards and nominations\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hasan Doƒüan Piker ( PY-k…ôr; Turkish: [haÀàsan doÀàan piÀàc√¶…æ]; born July 25, 1991), also known as HasanAbi, is a Turkish-American online streamer, YouTuber, influencer, and left-wing political commentator. His streams typically consist of political and social commentary, gaming, and media consumption. As of 2024, Piker is the fifth-most-subscribed channel on the streaming platform Twitch.\n\nEarly life and education\nHasan Piker was born to Turkish parents in New Brunswick, New Jersey, but grew up in Istanbul and was raised as a Muslim. His father's family emigrated to Turkey from Thessaloniki and Crete, Greece. His father, Mehmet Beh√ßet Piker, is a political scientist and economist who served on the Board of Directors (and as Vice President) of Sabancƒ± Holding, and who is a founding member of the Future Party in Turkey. His mother, √úlker Sedef Piker, (n√©e Uygur) is an art and architectural historian teaching at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. His uncle Cenk Uygur is a political commentator and co-founder of The Young Turks news network. Piker says he was bullied in public school in Turkey for his lack of physical fitness and for questioning Islam.\nPiker returned to the United States and attended the University of Miami, then transferred to Rutgers University, where he graduated cum laude with a double major in political science and communication studies in 2013.\n\nCareer\nThe Young Turks\nDuring his senior year of college in 2013, Piker interned for The Young Turks (TYT), a progressive news show and network co-founded by his uncle, Cenk Uygur. After graduating, Piker was hired by the network's ad sales and business department. He asked to host the show when a fill-in was needed and later became a host and producer.\nIn 2016, Piker created and hosted The Breakdown, a TYT Network video series which aired on Facebook and presented left-leaning political analyses targeted, at the time, at millennial supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The show was nominated for \"Best Web Series\" at the 10th Shorty Awards in 2018. Piker also contributed political content to HuffPost from 2016 to 2018.\nPiker created and hosted another TYT series in 2019, Agitprop with Hasan Piker. In January 2020, he announced his departure from TYT and his intention to focus on his career as a Twitch streamer.\n\nTwitch\nPiker started streaming on Twitch in March 2018 while working at TYT. Piker has said he shifted his attention from Facebook to Twitch in order to reach a younger audience and because of what he felt was a preponderance of right-wing commentators on YouTube and a lack of leftist representation among streamers. He became a popular left-wing political commentator, and was invited to appear on KTTV's The Issue Is and the political podcast Chapo Trap House. His YouTube channel features highlights of his streams, and in 2022 reached over 1,000,000 subscribers. Piker also streams gameplay and commentary of video games on his Twitch channel. Sometimes Piker will role-play as \"Hank Pecker\", a caricature of a right-wing redneck.\n\nComments on Dan Crenshaw and 9/11 and temporary ban\nDuring a Twitch stream on August 20, 2019, Piker mocked U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw, a SEAL Team 3 veteran who served in Afghanistan, for his support of American military interventionism overseas. Piker said of Crenshaw, \"What the fuck is wrong with this dude? Didn't he go to war and like, literally lose his eye because some mujahideen, a brave fucking soldier, fucked his eye-hole with their dick?\", adding that Crenshaw \"deserved\" his fate.\nIn the same stream, Piker criticized American foreign policy and made controversial comments relating to the September 11, 2001, attacks, including \"America deserved 9/11.\" His statements caused outrage on social media and were covered by Fox News and various other media outlets. Crenshaw said that Piker's comments were a \"disgusting defense of the 9/11 terrorist attacks against Americans.\" In response, Piker described his comments as satirical and cited American foreign policy as promoting conditions to make an event like 9/11 possible, but acknowledged that he should have used \"more precise\" language. Twitch banned Piker for one week due to the comments.\n\n2020 US presidential election, January 6 attack and 2024 US presidential election\nOn October 19, 2020, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez collaborated with Piker and fellow Twitch streamer Pokimane to organize a stream of the Representative playing the popular multiplayer game Among Us for the \"Get out the vote\" initiative for the upcoming presidential election. The stream aired the following day, featuring both Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar playing the game with Piker and other popular Twitch streamers, reaching a total concurrent viewership of almost 700,000.\nDuring the first 2020 United States presidential debate on September 29, Piker had over 125,000 viewers watching his commentary of the broadcast, the highest viewership of the debate on Twitch. Piker's stream covering the results of the 2020 United States presidential election peaked at 230,000 concurrent viewers and was the sixth most-watched source of election coverage across YouTube and Twitch, comprising 4.9% of the market share. He was the most watched Twitch streamer during the election week; his 80 hours of streams were viewed for a cumulative 6.8 million hours by an average of 75,000 concurrent viewers. Piker's stream reached a new high of 231,000 viewers during the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Piker's 2024 election night coverage stream had 7.5 million total viewers.\n\n2021 temporary ban for using \"cracker\" and later activities\nOn December 13, 2021, Piker was banned from Twitch for one week for using the racial epithet \"cracker\" repeatedly on stream. Piker argued the term should not be considered a slur against white people since a person using it is \"powerless\" and \"doing it as someone who has been historically oppressed blowing off steam.\" He further contended \"cracker\" is not a slur in the same way as other terms, stating that \"It's something I've talked about so many times because it's like white boys love fucking saying, 'Cracker is the same as the n-word,' It's really stupid. The etymology of the word is different. ... It comes from 'whip cracker.' So the power is still in the hands of the white person in that situation, whereas the n-word is dehumanizing.\"  An August 2023 paper in New Media & Society criticized Twitch for punishing Piker while epithets aimed minority groups were prevalent on the platform. The paper also criticized the subsequent commentary defending Twitch's decision as falsely equating \"cracker\" with other racial epithets.\n\nCoverage of the Gaza war\nPiker has regularly spoken about the Gaza war by advocating for Palestinians and criticizing the Israeli government.\nIn January 2024, Piker interviewed a Yemeni self-proclaimed \"pirate\" who had filmed himself on board the Galaxy Leader, a Bahamas-flagged ship that has been held captive by Houthi militants since November 2023.\nIn November 2024, congressman Ritchie Torres criticized Twitch for alleged \"amplification of antisemitism\", specifically calling for an investigation into Piker. Piker defended himself, arguing that he did not criticize Jewish people as a whole and was only anti-Zionist. A campaign by pro-Israeli advocates, including the streamer Destiny, pressured advertisers to leave Twitch due to the platforming of alleged antisemitism, including Piker's political commentary of the conflict. Both the pressure campaign and Ritchie Torres posted clips of Piker's channel they alleged to be antisemitic. Piker refuted the charge, arguing the clips were taken out of context. Because of the controversy, some advertisers have pulled advertisements.\n\n2025 comments on Rick Scott and temporary ban\nIn March 2025, Piker received a one-day ban from Twitch after stating during a stream, \"If you cared about Medicare fraud or Medicaid fraud, you would kill Rick Scott, okay?\", while reacting to remarks made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson regarding Medicare and Medicaid waste. Piker apologized on social media, clarifying that he should have stated that if Johnson genuinely cared about Medicaid fraud, he would seek the \"max punishment\" for Scott, who had committed the \"most Medicare fraud in [American] history.\" This was a reference to Scott's history of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.\n\nFundraisers\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Piker, in partnership with CARE, raised over $200,000 for Ukrainian relief funds while playing Elden Ring, with an average of over 70,000 people watching his coverage of the conflict.\nIn the aftermath of the February 6, 2023, Turkey‚ÄìSyria earthquake, Piker organized a fundraiser that was also contributed to and promoted by other streamers and content creators including Jacksepticeye, Valkyrae, Ludwig Ahgren and IShowSpeed. As of February 10, the fundraiser had raised over $1,200,000 for charities such as CARE International's Turkish and Syrian branches as well as two Turkish NGOs: the AKUT Search and Rescue Association, and Ahbap, which was founded by Turkish musician Haluk Levent.\nDuring the Israel‚ÄìHamas war, Piker's charity drive on his channel raised over $1,000,000, as of October 21, 2023, for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, American Near East Refugee Aid, Medical Aid for Palestinians, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.\n\nOther ventures\nSince 2021, Piker has hosted the podcast Fear& (formerly Fear&Malding) alongside his friend and fellow Twitch streamer, Will Neff. Streamers QTCinderella and AustinShow would later join the podcast as co-hosts in 2023. From September 26, 2021, to October 12, 2023, Piker co-hosted the left-leaning political podcast Leftovers with co-host Ethan Klein. On November 8, 2021, Piker released a line of union-made merchandise called Ideologie and donated a portion of the proceedings to strike funds in which he raised over $180,000.\n\nPolitical views\nPiker's content has been identified as a progressive, leftist, and socialist. He has advocated in favor of workplace democracy, universal health care, intersectional feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, anti-Zionism and gun control.\nPiker has cited his upbringing in Turkey under the Premiership of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan as an influence on both his left-wing views and willingness to speak out about them. Piker supported the presidential primary campaigns of Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020, and has been an outspoken critic of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Piker opposed Donald Trump's travel ban in 2017.\n\nReception\nPiker has been described as Twitch's \"de facto political commentator\" who uses an unabashedly ideological framing. Outlets dedicated to video game culture and youth culture have covered Piker's streams positively. In particular, journalists have noted his ability to \"combine information and entertainment,\" and to approach left-wing political coverage in a way that is relatable and accessible to Twitch viewers, who may feel out of touch with cable news. Some authors also cite Piker's vulgar, animated style of expression and his physical appearance as notable factors behind his popularity.\nIn July 2024, Alex Mahadevan of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, cited Piker as an example of the \"online chattering class\" who do not hold themselves to journalistic ethics, in contrast to their peers in traditional media. A September 2024 article in the academic journal Digital Journalism discussed a similar theme, characterizing Piker as emblematic of an emerging \"Newsfluencers\" class (influencers who mainly cover news) with a tendency towards \"problematic behavior\" that conflicted with journalistic objectivity. In April 2024, the same journal noted that Piker is familiar with journalistic mechanics such as sourcing, framing, and objectivity, but rejects these as methods used for \"manufacturing consent for elites\". Instead, Piker mainly sources his information from social media, often supplied to him by his audience.  \nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Piker apologized for insisting in the prelude that Russia would not attack. \"[I] didn't think a regional power would act so irrationally. I've admitted my mistakes. I got things wrong,\" stated Piker. The Washington Post has also categorized Piker as a news-based influencer who does not feel bound to journalistic objectivity.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2021, Piker purchased a $2.7 million house in West Hollywood, California.\n\nAwards and nominations\nGaming website Kotaku selected Piker as one of their \"Gamers of the Year\" for 2020, citing him as a major figure in the mainstreaming of political commentary on Twitch, a platform which in the past was seen as discouraging to political discussion. Piker won a Streamy in the News category at the 10th annual awards in 2020 and was nominated again in the same category for the 2021 event. In 2022, Piker was nominated in the categories News, Just Chatting, and Streamer of the Year, winning the News award for the second time and being nominated for three consecutive years. At the event, he also presented the Creator of the Year award alongside Avani Gregg, which was won by MrBeast for the third year in a row. At the 2023 Streamer Awards, Piker was nominated for Best Just Chatting Streamer and Streamer of the Year, winning the former.\n\nFilmography\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nHasanAbi on Twitch\nHasanAbi's channel on YouTube\n Media related to Hasan Piker at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "FaZe Clan, or simply FaZe, is a professional esports and entertainment brand. Founded on May 30, 2010, as FaZe Sniping, the organization has professional players and content creators from around the world, across multiple games.\nIn October 2023, an agreement was announced for FaZe Clan's parent company FaZe Holdings to be acquired by GameSquare in an all stock deal. In May 2024, GameSquare announced the formation of a new company, FaZe Media, led by Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson. This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an esports company, and an internet media company.\n\nHistory\nFaZe Sniping made its debut on YouTube on May 30, 2010. Originally, the group were a Call of Duty clan founded by three players, Eric \"CLipZ\" Rivera, Jeff \"House Cat\" Emann (now known as \"Timid\") and Ben \"Resistance\" Christensen. The trio garnered a reputation for innovating trickshotting in the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Their YouTube content took off when Ted \"Fakie\" joined the clan. It was then when FaZe unveiled the most popular series on their channel, ILLCAMS. FaZe Clan's focus on trickshotting and a personality-driven approach to social media led to FaZe Clan becoming one of the first popular YouTube video game channels, compared to other Call of Duty channels which often focused solely on winning tournaments. In 2012, the channel had one million subscribers, and the clan began to branch out into esports competitions. Teams under the FaZe name began competing in competitions such as the Call of Duty Championship and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships, who were separate from the clan's YouTube content creators, splitting members of FaZe Clan into two mostly autonomous camps. Originally, FaZe Clan did not have a corporate structure, however the original CEO was Thomas \"Temperrr\" Oliveira, who had been a member of FaZe since he was 16 years old. Oliveira and COO Richard ‚ÄúBanks‚Äù Bengtson created the first FaZe shared home in 2014 in Plainview, New York, intended to facilitate lifestyle content alongside their gaming content.\nIn 2015, former social media platform Hubrick, run by Norwegian entrepreneur Sebastian Geurts, invested in FaZe Clan. Hubrick recruited former record executive Lee Trink to act as an advisor. In January 2016, FaZe Clan acquired European esports team G2 Esports's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive international lineup, who competed as FaZe Clan in the 2016 MLG Major Championship: Columbus, The team won second place in ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018, losing to US-based Cloud9. In 2017, Bengtson moved to Los Angeles, starting a new shared home with YouTubers called the Clout House. FaZe Clan were the runners up in ESL Pro League Season 6 in 2017, and second runners up of ESL Pro League Season 7 and ESL One Cologne 2018. FaZe Clan were the champions of ELeague CS:GO Premier in 2017, winning $500,000 of prize money.\nIn 2018, Greg Selkoe, founder of streetware web retailer Karmaloop, became the president of FaZe Clan, with Trink becoming the CEO. In late 2018, FaZe Clan opened its series A funding round. Throughout 2019, musicians Ray J, DJ Paul, Offset, Swae Lee, Yo Gotti, Pitbull, and Disco Fries, basketball players Meyers Leonard, Josh Hart, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, footballer Gregory van der Wiel, skateboarder Nyjah Huston, radio host Big Boy, music executives Sylvia Rhone, Troy Carter and Guy Oseary and actor Chris O'Donnell invested in FaZe Clan. In December 2019, FaZe closed its series A led by entrepreneur Jimmy Iovine and mobile e-commerce platform NTWRK.\nIn January 2020, FaZe Clan obtained a $22.7 million investment loan from a private lender. FaZe was advised on the transaction by Canaccord Genuity, a Canadian financial company. On June 18, 2020, FaZe Clan announced its co-ownership of CTRL, a food supplement company. In December 2020, FaZe Clan was worth $305 million. That same month the revenue of FaZe Clan was estimated $40 million. It also released the film Crimson under FaZe Studios in 2020, with Brian \"Rug\" Awadis in a leading role.\nOn June 10, 2021, FaZe Clan became the first esports team to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The same year, a merger was announced with special purpose acquisition investors B. Riley Principal to become a public company listed on NASDAQ, with an expected initial valuation of about $1 billion. As part of this merge, FaZe would receive $291 million from B. Riley, and would be renamed to Faze Holdings Inc. and refocus itself as a brand for \"the voice of youth culture\". The merger was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the company went public on July 20, 2022, however with a lower than announced valuation of $725 million. Also in 2021, FaZe Clan member Frazier Khattrri (FaZe Kay) would become one of the lead promoters of Save the Kids token, a pump and dump cryptocurrency which was additionally promoted by FaZe members Jarvis, Teeqo and Nikan. Upon the token's launch and revelation to the public that it was a pump and dump, FaZe removed Kay and suspended Jarvis, Teeqo, and Nikan for their involvement.\nIn July 2022, FaZe Clan became a publicly traded company. The company had only received a portion of the money they were promised by private investors ahead of their merge with B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Group. On January 20, 2023, the price of their stock fell below one dollar for the first time, which put them at risk of being delisted. According to Nasdaq policy, if a company's stock is under one dollar for more than a month, the company will receive a deficiency notice, in which they have 180 days for the stock to be one dollar or more for ten consecutive business days. As of February 15, 2023, the stock was at $0.76. In March 2023, it was reported that the company received a notice of delisting, which gave them 180 days to raise the stock price above one dollar. Trink, the CEO, had expressed concerns and had stated that the company is working towards a solution to their problem. As of September 2022, it was reported that the organization had enough money to last them until November 2023.\nIn February 2023, FaZe Clan laid off 20% of its staff. Trink attributed it to uncertainty in the economy stated that the company would focus on financial discipline. He reported that the revenue growth for 2022 was a 25% increase from 2021. However, FaZe Clan reported losses of approximately $14 million in the first two quarters of 2023, with slightly decreased revenues. In April 2023, Snoop Dogg departed from FaZe Clan's board, and on September 11, 2023, FaZe Clan announced the immediate termination of Trink from his position as CEO. The company appointed Christoph Pachler, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of FaZe Clan, as the interim CEO.\nIn October 2023, it was announced that FaZe Clan had been acquired by GameSquare Holdings Inc., and subsequently added to the GameSquare esports portfolio. With this acquisition, Bengtson, Oliveira, and Yousef Abdelfattah (FaZe Apex) were appointed as CEO, president, and COO respectively.\nOn April 27, 2024, Bengtson kicked out members of FaZe Clan, reducing the content creator roster to fourteen members in an effort to \"reboot\" the organization.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Esports World Cup Foundation, funded by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and organizers of the Esports World Cup tournament series, announced the 30 organizations (known in the ESWC as Clubs) who would make up the Club Support Program, with FaZe Clan being one of them. This program gives teams a one-time six-figure stipend if an organization is willing to enter new esports as well as additional funding each year if they drive viewership and fan engagement to the Esports World Cup.\nOn May 14, 2024, GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna announced the formation of FaZe Media, led by Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson as CEO. This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an esports company, and an internet media company. FaZe Media received $11 million in investment from Matt Kalish, the president and co-founder of DraftKings, resulting in Kalish owning 49% of FaZe Media during its foundation.  FaZe Media will focus on developing a creator-led internet media company with GameSquare continuing to own 100% of the esports competition assets under FaZe Esports. On June 19, 2024, Richard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson acquired 25.5% in FaZe Media from GameSquare.\nIn December 2024, FaZe won Best Content Organization at The Streamer Awards, where it was also nominated for Best Marathon Stream. At the time, its new streamer roster included JasonTheWeen, Adapt, PlaqueBoyMax, Banks, Silky, Lacy, and StableRonaldo.\n\nCurrent divisions\nCall of Duty\nFaZe France\nOn September 19, 2013, FaZe eSniping, their competitive Call of Duty sniping division, was announced with the joining of Raphael \"Zydar\" Zydar, Elliot \"Hyspe\" and Kevin \"RanbOw\", led by Anil \"WaRTeK\" Brancaleoni. On April 3, 2014, FaZe Clan announced the rebranding of FaZe eSniping to FaZe France. RanbOw left the team after one and a half years, with Anthony \"Toto\" replacing him. On May 26, 2015, the players and staff of FaZe France stated they weren't satisfied with FaZe's plans and left to create their own organization.\n\nAtlanta FaZe\nOn May 2, 2019, Activision Blizzard announced that Atlanta Esports Ventures had purchased one of the first five franchise slots for the Call of Duty League. According to ESPN, the publisher was looking to sell slots for approximately $25 million per team. \"We have the opportunity to‚Äîonce again‚Äîplay a pivotal role in Atlanta's diverse esports community by bringing the future of Call of Duty esports to the city,\" said Hamilton in a release at the time. AEV and FaZe Clan partnered together for the team, and in October 2019, they announced that the team would be named the Atlanta FaZe.\n\nCurrent roster\nRosters\nPartnerships and collaborations\nFaZe Clan has partnered with caffeinated drink mix brand Gamma Labs' G Fuel since 2012, which is currently one of the longest promotional collaborations in esports.

After retiring from competitive esports, Lazar became a well-known streamer on Twitch by streaming CS:GO and WarZ. He streams a variety of video games, such as Escape from Tarkov, Grand Theft Auto V, Sea of Thieves, Overwatch, DayZ, iRacing, Foxhole,  Hearthstone and Rust.\n\nStreaming on Twitch\nIn 2017, Lazar garnered widespread attention for surpassing Syndicate's number of followers on Twitch. In 2018, Lazar's became the most-followed channel on the platform, surpassing Riot Games.\nIn May 2018, Lazar streamed gameplay with internet personality Jake Paul and received complaints and criticism from fans due to Paul's recent controversial behavior. Lazar told viewers, \"I'm a little disappointed in chat. I had hoped the 1g squad to be a little bit different. I thought some people had a little bit thicker skin.\"\nIn April 2020, Lazar made comments about Valorant, a free-to-play multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Riot Games. He claimed the game's closed beta was poorly managed, and that other streamers had manipulated Twitch's \"Drops\" system to receive game keys, giving them access to the closed beta to increase their viewer counts and the game's total number of viewers. He later apologized on Twitter, then subsequently deleted the apology.\nIn May 2020, Lazar signed a multi-year contract with Twitch to provide content and partnership support. As of September 27, 2023, he has over 6 million Twitch followers, and is ranked its 28th most popular streamer.\nAs of July 2021, Lazar has regularly speedrun Max Payne 3 during his Twitch streams.

        "content": "In mathematical analysis, the maximum and minimum of a function are, respectively, the greatest and least value taken by the function. Known generically as extremum, they may be defined either within a given range (the local or relative extrema) or on the entire domain (the global or absolute extrema) of a function. Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions.\nAs defined in set theory, the maximum and minimum of a set are the greatest and least elements in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of real numbers, have no minimum or maximum.\nIn statistics, the corresponding concept is the sample maximum and minimum.\n\nDefinition\nA real-valued function f defined on a domain X has a global (or absolute) maximum point at x‚àó, if f(x‚àó) ‚â• f(x) for all x in X. Similarly, the function has a global (or absolute) minimum point at x‚àó, if f(x‚àó) ‚â§ f(x) for all x in X. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the maximum value of the function, denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        max\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\max(f(x))}\n  \n, and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the minimum value of the function, (denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        min\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\min(f(x))}\n  \n for clarity).

Similarly, the function has a local minimum point at x‚àó, if f(x‚àó) ‚â§ f(x) for all x in X within distance Œµ of x‚àó. A similar definition can be used when X is a topological space, since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows:\n\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        \n          d\n          \n            X\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (X,d_{X})}\n  \n be a metric space and function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        X\n        ‚Üí\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:X\\to \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n.

For example, x‚àó is a strict global maximum point if for all x in X with x ‚â† x‚àó, we have f(x‚àó) > f(x), and x‚àó is a strict local maximum point if there exists some Œµ > 0 such that, for all x in X within distance Œµ of x‚àó with x ‚â† x‚àó, we have f(x‚àó) > f(x). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.\nA continuous real-valued function with a compact domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed and bounded interval of real numbers (see the graph above).\n\nSearch\nFinding global maxima and minima is the goal of mathematical optimization. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the extreme value theorem, global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the greatest (or least) one.Minima\nFor differentiable functions, Fermat's theorem states that local extrema in the interior of a domain must occur at critical points (or points where the derivative equals zero). However, not all critical points are extrema. One can often distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither by using the first derivative test, second derivative test, or higher-order derivative test, given sufficient differentiability.\nFor any function that is defined piecewise, one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is greatest (or least).\n\nExamples\nFor a practical example, assume a situation where someone has \n  \n    \n      \n        200\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 200}\n  \n feet of fencing and is trying to maximize the square footage of a rectangular enclosure, where \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is the length, \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n is the width, and \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy}\n  \n is the area:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        x\n        +\n        2\n        y\n        =\n        200\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x+2y=200}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        y\n        =\n        200\n        ‚àí\n        2\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2y=200-2x}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              y\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              200\n              ‚àí\n              2\n              x\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2y}{2}}={\\frac {200-2x}{2}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        100\n        ‚àí\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=100-x}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n        =\n        x\n        (\n        100\n        ‚àí\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy=x(100-x)}\n  \n\nThe derivative with respect to \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    d\n                    \n                      d\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n                x\n                y\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    d\n                    \n                      d\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n                x\n                (\n                100\n                ‚àí\n                x\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    d\n                    \n                      d\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    100\n                    x\n                    ‚àí\n                    \n                      x\n                      \n                        2\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                100\n                ‚àí\n                2\n                x\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\frac {d}{dx}}xy&={\\frac {d}{dx}}x(100-x)\\\\&={\\frac {d}{dx}}\\left(100x-x^{2}\\right)\\\\&=100-2x\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nSetting this equal to \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        =\n        100\n        ‚àí\n        2\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0=100-2x}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        x\n        =\n        100\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x=100}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        50\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=50}\n  \n\nreveals that \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        50\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=50}\n  \n is our only critical point.\nNow retrieve the endpoints by determining the interval to which \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is restricted.

For example, in the (enlargeable) figure on the right, the necessary conditions for a local maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first partial derivatives as to z (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative. These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum, because of the possibility of a saddle point. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function z must also be differentiable throughout. The second partial derivative test can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.\nIn contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function f defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the intermediate value theorem and Rolle's theorem to prove this by contradiction). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails. This is illustrated by the function\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        1\n        ‚àí\n        x\n        \n          )\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ‚àà\n        \n          R\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}(1-x)^{3},\\qquad x,y\\in \\mathbb {R} ,}\n  \n\nwhose only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with f(0,0) = 0. However, it cannot be a global one, because f(2,3) = ‚àí5.\n\nMaxima or minima of a functional\nIf the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions (i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a functional), then the extremum is found using the calculus of variations.\n\nIn relation to sets\nMaxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an ordered set S has a greatest element m, then m is a maximal element of the set, also denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        max\n        (\n        S\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\max(S)}\n  \n. Furthermore, if S is a subset of an ordered set T and m is the greatest element of S with (respect to order induced by T), then m is a least upper bound of S in T. Similar results hold for least element, minimal element and greatest lower bound. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in databases, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self-decomposable aggregation functions.\nIn the case of a general partial order, a least element (i.e., one that is less than all others) should not be confused with the minimal element (nothing is lesser). Likewise, a greatest element of a partially ordered set (poset) is an upper bound of the set which is contained within the set, whereas the maximal element m of a poset A is an element of A such that if m ‚â§ b (for any b in A), then m = b. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.  If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.\nIn a totally ordered set, or chain, all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element.  Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element, and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set, we can simply use the terms minimum and maximum. \nIf a chain is finite, then it will always have a maximum and a minimum.  If a chain is infinite, then it need not have a maximum or a minimum.  For example, the set of natural numbers has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain S is bounded, then the closure Cl(S) of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in which case they are called the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the set S, respectively.\n\nArgument of the maximum\nSee also\nDerivative test\nInfimum and supremum\nLimit superior and limit inferior\nMaximum-minimums identity\nMechanical equilibrium\nMex (mathematics)\nSaddle point\nSample maximum and minimum\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThomas Simpson's work on Maxima and Minima at Convergence\nApplication of Maxima and Minima with sub pages of solved problems\nJolliffe, Arthur Ernest (1911). \"Maxima and Minima\" .

        "content": "Timothy John Betar (born April 8, 1990), better known as TimTheTatman, is an American live streamer and YouTube personality.\n\nCareer\nBetar started streaming on Twitch in 2012 and has amassed over seven million followers since. Broadcasting games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, Fortnite and World of Warcraft, the variety channel attracts thousands of viewers each day.\nBetar is a Monster Energy esports athlete and is also sponsored by Audio-Technica He was a certified Twitch partner and has been a full-time creator since March 2014. After joining YouTube on January 23, 2011, the channel has grown to 3.2 million subscribers with videos viewed over 524 million times.\nWith the release of Epic Games's Fortnite in July 2017, Twitch stream viewership skyrocketed. The game streamed nearly 151 million hours during the first month of release. Streamers such as Betar, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, and Turner \"Tfue\" Tenney, saw a steady increase in followers as the game grew in popularity.\nDuring E3 2018, Epic Games held its first-ever Fortnite Celebrity Pro-Am, which paired up celebrities with professional gamers to raise money for charity. Betar teamed up with Mack Wilds for the event. Betar won the award for Fan Favorite Male Streamer/Gamer of the Year at the 2018 Gamers' Choice Awards. \nIn September 2021, Betar announced an exclusivity contract with YouTube. He signed with Complexity Gaming as a part-owner and content-creator that same month.\nIn May 2023, he made a request for the removal of his skin from the popular video game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. This request was made in support of his friend, Nickmercs, who had his own skin removed by Activision after tweeting \"They should leave little children alone. That's the real issue.\" in response to a brawl in California that stemmed from schools attempting to incorporate lessons on the LGBTQ+ community into the school curriculum.\nOn September 1, 2024, Betar returned to the Twitch live-streaming platform following the expiration of his exclusivity contract with YouTube. He now simulcasts his content across multiple platforms.\n\nAwards and nominations\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2018, Betar teamed up with fellow streamers to raise money for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital under the GuardianCon charity stream marathon. The event raised over $2.7 million for children's medical research. During his time block alone, Betar set the Twitch charitable donation record by raising more than $106,000 in 4 hours.\n\nPersonal life\nBetar was born on April 8, 1990. After meeting in high school, Betar and his wife Alexis were married in August 2016. The couple had a son, Brewer, on April 11, 2019. Betar is a native of Syracuse, New York and is a fan of the Syracuse Orange.\n\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, set to take place in June, has become a major objective for Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, and Inter Miami this season. In a bid to strengthen the squad ahead of the prestigious tournament, the Florida side could land a World Cup-winning midfielder before the competition kicks off. One of the main concerns among fans ‚Äî and even voiced by Suarez himself ‚Äî has been the Major League Soccer (MLS) regulations that limit Inter Miami‚Äôs ability to build a highly competitive squad for the Club World Cup. However, a unique market opportunity could now allow the club to make a significant addition. According to RMC Sport, Inter Miami has emerged as one of the strongest options for Paul Pogba to return to professional soccer. The 2018 World Cup winner with France will be eligible to play once his suspension ends on Tuesday, March 11th, giving Inter Miami the chance to secure his services without delay. Pogba has previously been spotted attending Inter Miami matches at Chase Stadium, including games against Charlotte FC and Atlanta United last year. With Pogba and his family already residing in Miami, this factor could play a pivotal role in convincing him to restart his career with the MLS side. The French midfielder was also seen at Inter Miami‚Äôs MLS season opener, where he reunited with co-owner David Beckham, with whom he shares a strong relationship. With the MLS transfer window open until April 23rd and Leonardo Campana‚Äôs recent departure, Inter Miami has a Designated Player (DP) spot available ‚Äî giving them the flexibility to offer Pogba a lucrative contract. Inter Miami coach Mascherano opens up on failed plan after leaving Lionel Messi on the bench vs Charlotte Following the reduction of his ban, Pogba has been linked to several clubs, though few solid options have emerged in Europe. The most notable interest came from Olympique de Marseille, with both the club‚Äôs president and coach Roberto De Zerbi expressing admiration for the midfielder. How",

        "content": "F√©lix Lengyel (French pronunciation: [feliks l…ëÃÉ í…õl]; born November 12, 1995), better known as xQc (formerly xQcOW), is a Canadian online streamer, influencer, and former professional Overwatch player.\nWhile he is best known for his streaming career, Lengyel initially gained recognition as a professional Overwatch player. His esports career began in 2016, during which he also started streaming regularly. He joined the Dallas Fuel, a team competing in the inaugural season of the Overwatch League, in late 2017. However, his time with the Dallas Fuel was marred by controversy, resulting in repeated suspensions and ultimately his release from the team midway through the season. Additionally, Lengyel represented Team Canada in the Overwatch World Cup from 2017 to 2019.\nFollowing his departure from competitive Overwatch, Lengyel shifted his focus to a full-time streaming career on Twitch. During this period, he also signed with several esports organizations, such as Sentinels and Luminosity Gaming, as a content creator. Throughout his streaming career, Lengyel has faced several bans and suspensions on Twitch for violating platform guidelines. These incidents involved showing explicit content, making offensive remarks, and engaging in stream sniping. Despite these controversies, Lengyel maintained a large and dedicated fanbase, consistently attracting high viewership numbers. He was the most-watched streamer on Twitch for three consecutive years, from 2020 to 2022. In June 2023, Lengyel signed a two-year, non-exclusive $100 million deal to stream on Kick.\n\nCareer\nEarly streaming\nAfter finishing high school, Lengyel enrolled in a CEGEP, studying business administration until dropping out in second year after feeling \"directionless\". At the age of 19, Lengyel subsequently began streaming on the platform Twitch, where he initially played League of Legends (LoL) under the pseudonym xQcLoL. The name xQc was derived from the last letter of his first name, x, combined with the abbreviation for his home province of Quebec, QC. As his streaming career progressed, Lengyel gained recognition and prominence primarily through his involvement with Overwatch, a video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. Consequently, he adjusted his alias to xQcOW to reflect his association with Overwatch (OW).\n\nEsports\nLengyel embarked on his professional esports career in Overwatch by initially competing in smaller online tournaments as a tank player for teams such as DatZit Gaming. In October 2016, he was recruited by Denial Esports, a prominent multi-game esports organization. However, after a brief period, Denial disbanded, leading Lengyel and his former teammates to form an independent roster called Yikes, which later underwent a name change to Arc 6. During their tenure, the team participated in Season Zero of Overwatch Contenders, where Lengyel's competitive drive appeared to reach unhealthy levels. He acknowledged prioritizing gaming over fundamental aspects of life, such as sleep, nutrition, and personal relationships, and he would dedicate all of his time to playing ranked matches to regain confidence following subpar performances. Lengyel also had the opportunity to represent Team Canada in the 2017 Overwatch World Cup. The team reached the tournament finals before ultimately being defeated by the reigning champions, South Korea. Despite the loss, Lengyel was named the event's most valuable player.\n\nIn October 2017, Lengyel joined the Dallas Fuel, one of the teams competing in the inaugural season of the Overwatch League (OWL). However, before the start of the season, he faced two suspensions on his personal Overwatch account from Blizzard. The first suspension was a 72-hour penalty in November for misusing the game's reporting system. The second suspension, a seven-day penalty in December, was a result of him throwing games on stream. Lengyel's debut in the Overwatch League occurred during the Fuel's first match of the season on January 10, 2018. The team suffered a 1‚Äì2 loss to the Seoul Dynasty. Following the Fuel's third match, a 0‚Äì4 defeat against the Houston Outlaws on January 18, Lengyel made homophobic remarks directed at Austin \"Muma\" Wilmot, a player from the Outlaws who is openly gay, during his personal Twitch stream. Lengyel later issued an apology to Muma on Twitter, expressing that his comments were not intended to be malicious and that he had spoken hastily. In response to the incident, the Fuel decided to bench Lengyel for the subsequent match on January 19. Additionally, the Overwatch League fined him $2,000 and suspended him for four matches. The Fuel then extended the suspension through February 10.\nLengyel made his return to the Overwatch League on February 23 in a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Los Angeles Gladiators. However, his comeback was short-lived. On March 10, he received a fine of $4,000 and another four-match suspension from the league. The disciplinary action was taken due to his usage of an emote in a \"racially disparaging manner\" during an Overwatch League stream and on his personal social media accounts. Additionally, Lengyel had used \"disparaging language\" against Overwatch League broadcasters and players on his social media and personal stream. The following day, Lengyel was released from the Dallas Fuel team. In an interview with The Washington Post, he expressed that there were no racial undertones intended with his use of the emote. While Lengyel did not feel that he had made a mistake, he expressed regret for how his actions were misconstrued. He also admitted uncertainty about whether pursuing a professional career in Overwatch was the right path for him.\nLengyel's involvement in the Overwatch scene continued as he joined various teams over the years. He became a part of the Overwatch Contenders teams GOATS and Gladiators Legion. Additionally, he represented Team Canada in the 2018 and 2019 Overwatch World Cups.\n\nReturn to full-time streaming\nAfter his departure from Dallas Fuel in 2018, Lengyel shifted his focus primarily towards his streaming career. In February 2019, he joined esports organization Sentinels as a content creator. By May 2019, Lengyel had gained significant success as one of the most prominent variety streamers on Twitch. However, Lengyel also faced some controversies during his streaming career. In July 2019, he received a three-day ban from Twitch for streaming a video that contained brief explicit content, specifically showing a penis. Although a Twitch employee had reportedly permitted the video, the ban was enforced. However, Lengyel's ban was lifted after just one day. Despite these incidents, Lengyel achieved notable milestones on Twitch. In December 2019, he emerged as Twitch's most watched streamer, accumulating nearly eight million hours of watch time, surpassing other popular channels by a significant margin. Overall, he ranked as the sixth-most watched streamer of the year, accumulating nearly 54 million hours of watch time, with over 14% coming from December alone.\nIn 2020, Lengyel faced a series of bans and controversies during his streaming career. On February 29, he received a three-day ban from Twitch for streaming explicit content in the game Strip 4: Classmate Study. Lengyel entered a code that uncensored nudity in the game, leading to a brief exposure of the female character's breasts. Twitch upheld the ban even after his appeal, and the game gained attention, reaching the top of Steam's \"new and trending\" list. In March 2020, Lengyel started playing chess on his stream, and in April, he received mentoring from chess grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura. Twitch and Chess.com collaborated to organize the inaugural PogChamps, a chess tournament that took place from June 5 to 19. Lengyel participated in the tournament, and in a match against Charlie \"MoistCr1TiKaL\" White, he was defeated in just six moves. The match became the most-watched video on Chess.com's YouTube channel, garnering over ten million views by May 2021. In the PogChamps tournament, Lengyel reached the consolation bracket semifinals but ultimately lost to Ludwig Ahgren. During PogChamps, on June 12, 2020, Lengyel received a 24-hour Twitch ban after accidentally opening a video of gorillas engaging in sexual activity, which was submitted by one of his viewers. Sentinels decided to part ways with him on August 27, 2020, after his request for release. He then joined Luminosity Gaming on October 1, 2020. Lengyel faced another suspension from Twitch on November 18, 2020, when he and his team stream sniped an opposing team during a Twitch Rivals event for Fall Guys. This marked his fourth suspension from Twitch, resulting in a seven-day ban. He was also banned from Twitch Rivals for six months and had to forfeit his prize winnings from the event. Despite the bans and controversies, Lengyel achieved remarkable Twitch viewership in 2020. He accumulated the highest watch hours at over 174 million, surpassing all other channels by nearly 50 million watch hours.\n\nBy mid-2021, Lengyel continued to dominate Twitch viewership, with 163 million hours watched that year, nearly double that of the second-largest channel. In June 2021, Lengyel made the decision to move back to Canada after experiencing multiple instances of swatting, a dangerous prank targeting streamers. He expressed genuine fear for his safety and cited concerns about his well-being. In October 2021, a leak exposed the earnings of top Twitch streamers, including Lengyel. The leak revealed that he was the highest-paid individual streamer, earning over $8 million since 2019. While the accuracy of the leak was questioned, Lengyel confirmed that his reported earnings were correct. Lengyel maintained his position as the most-watched streamer on Twitch in 2021, accumulating 274 million hours watched. His peak viewership reached 173,000 viewers, although it fell short compared to the channel with the highest peak, which garnered 2.5 million viewers.\nIn April 2022, Lengyel participated in the r/place social experiment on Reddit, an online canvas in which registered users could edit by changing the colour of a single pixel. During the event, he targeted a My Little Pony art piece, which resulted in an influx of death threats. Lengyel said that he received more death threats in just one hour during that month than he had throughout his previous six years of streaming combined. Despite the negativity, he broke his Twitch viewership record, peaking at over 293,000 viewers during the event. Later that month, he surpassed that record while streaming a beta build of Overwatch 2, reaching a peak of over 312,000 viewers. He continued to lead all Twitch streamers in terms of hours watched for the year 2022.\nIn January 2023, Lengyel announced his departure from Luminosity Gaming. In June 2023, Lengyel signed a deal with the streaming platform Kick. The deal was valued at $70 million over two years, established a non-exclusive partnership between Lengyel and Kick. Additionally, the agreement included the potential for performance-based bonuses, totaling approximately $30 million. The deal was noted as potentially one of the largest in entertainment history. Lengyel finished 2023 as Twitch's fourth-most watched streamer with a total of 89 million hours watched on the platform.\nIn October 2024, Forbes ranked the influencer 28th in their Top Creators 2024 list.\n\nPersonal life\nLengyel was born on November 12, 1995, in Laval, Quebec, Canada. He is of Hungarian descent.\nFrom 2017 to 2022, Lengyel was in a relationship with fellow streamer Samantha Lopez, known by her Twitch username adeptthebest.\nOn August 5, 2024, Lengyel accompanied online streamer Adin Ross during a meeting with president of the United States Donald Trump.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nXQc on Twitch",

        "content": "Tariq (Arabic: ÿ∑ÿßÿ±ŸÇ) is an Arabic word and given name.\n\nEtymology\nThe word is derived from the Arabic verb ÿ∑ÿ±ŸÇ‚Äé, (·π≠araqa), meaning \"to strike\", and into the agentive conjugated doer form ÿ∑ÿßÿ±ŸÇ‚Äé, (·π≠ƒÅriq), meaning \"striker\". It became popular as a name after Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Muslim military leader who conquered Iberia in the Battle of Guadalete in 711 AD. It is also the name of a Quranic chapter.\n\nIn literature and placenames\n·π¨ariq is used in classical Arabic to refer to a visitor at night (a visitor \"strikes\" the house door). Due to the heat of travel in the Arabian Peninsula, visitors would generally arrive at night.\nThe use of the word appears in several places including the Quran, where ·π≠ƒÅriq is used to refer to the brilliant star at night, because it comes out visiting at night, and this is the common understanding of the word nowadays due to the Qur'an.\nIt can also be found in many poems. For example, from the famous poets Imru' al-Qais and Jarir ibn Atiyah.\nGibraltar is the Spanish derivation of the Arabic name Jabal A·π≠tƒÅriq (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑ ÿ∑ÿßÿ±ŸÇ), meaning \"Mountain of Tariq\".\n\nUsage\nIn the Balkans, Tarik is popular among Bosniaks in the former Yugoslav nations.

        "content": "By the time I landed at LAX and switched my phone out of airplane mode, Hasan Piker had been streaming for three hours. I put in an earbud and watched as I filed off the plane. Visible behind him were walls of framed fan art, a cardboard cutout of Bernie Sanders sitting in the cold, and Piker‚Äôs huge puppy, Kaya, taking a nap. Piker had already shown off his ‚Äúcozy-ass ‚Äôfit‚Äù (sweatpants with kitschy bald eagles, a custom pair of platform Crocs), and recounted his experience the previous night at the Streamer Awards, a red-carpet event honoring A-listers on Twitch‚Äîthe popular live-streaming site where he is one of the biggest stars, and the only prominent leftist. He‚Äôd begun the day‚Äôs broadcast by rattling off a standard opening monologue: ‚ÄúFolks, we‚Äôre live and alive, and I hope all the boys, girls, and enbies‚Äù‚Äînonbinary people‚Äî‚Äúare having a fantastic one.‚Äù To anyone listening for shibboleths, this would have pigeonholed him as a progressive. Also within view, though, were three towers of Zyn cannisters, and a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hat, which he sometimes wears ironically. He has the patter of a Rutgers frat bro and the laid-back charisma of a Miami club promoter, both of which he was, briefly, in his early twenties. Now he‚Äôs thirty-three‚Äîso old, in streamer years, that his fans call him ‚Äúunc.‚Äù I ordered a Lyft, then flipped back to Piker‚Äôs stream. By then, he was talking about the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, which had happened overnight. I watched as he cycled from BBC footage to Wikipedia, pausing every few seconds to add a diatribe or a joke. The angle he was developing was that Western journalists seemed too eager to portray the leader of the Syrian rebel forces in a heroic light. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very skeptical of the fucking former Al Qaeda guy,‚Äù Piker said. A little while later, his doorbell rang, and he leaned over to buzz in a guest‚Äîme. I looked up from my phone to see him standing in his doorway.

        "content": "Team Liquid is a multi-regional professional esports organization based in the Netherlands that was founded in 2000. They signed their first professional players with the release of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.\nIn 2012, Team Liquid acquired a North American Dota 2 team, marking their first venture into multi-genre management. In January 2015, Team Liquid officially merged with Team Curse under the Liquid banner, bringing on Steve Arhancet, his supporting staff, and former Curse League of Legends, Street Fighter, and Super Smash Bros. teams. Their European Dota 2 squad won The International 2017, which had one of the largest prize pools for any esports tournament in history. Team Liquid's League of Legends team has won five LCS titles, and their Counter-Strike Global Offensive team was awarded the Intel Grand Slam prize in 2019 after winning four tournaments in just 63 days. Team Liquid also has Rainbow Six Siege, Free Fire and female Valorant teams in Brazil, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang rosters in Indonesia and the Philippines and chess grandmasters Fabiano Caruana and Magnus Carlsen representing the organization.\n\nHistory\nThe website was released on May 1, 2001, by Victor \"Nazgul\" Goossens and Joy \"Meat\" Hoogeveen under the domain teamliquid.cjb.net. On September 22, 2002, the website was moved to the address of teamliquid.net. A day later the very first poll was posted as a vote for the website's name with the teamliquid.net name winning over other suggestions such as likwit.com. On April 5, 2019, it was announced that the website would be moving to the domain tl.net, with teamliquid.net becoming an alias for teamliquid.com in the future.\nAlthough Team Liquid was primarily known as a StarCraft news site, there are many sub sections on the forums dedicated to other games as well. It was announced on August 30, 2012, that Team Liquid would be expanding to covering Dota 2 news. On December 8, 2012, Liquid expanded their esports franchise into multiple games for the first time, with the recruitment of a North American Dota 2 team.\nOn January 6, 2015, Steven \"LiQuiD112\" Arhancet joined Victor Goossens as co-owner of Team Liquid, officially commencing the merge between former Team Curse Gaming under the Team Liquid banner.\nOn September 27, 2016, Team Liquid sold its controlling interest to aXiomatic Gaming, an investment group including Golden State Warriors co-owner Peter Guber, entrepreneur Ted Leonsis, motivational speaker Tony Robbins, basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, and AOL co-founder Steve Case.\nOn December 16, 2017, Team Liquid disbanded their Halo roster.\nIn 2020, the organization introduced Blue, an anthropomorphic horse, as its mascot. Blue has been featured in the organization's merchandising campaigns and collaborations.\n\nOwnership\naXiomatic is an entertainment and sports management company. Investors for the group include Peter Guber, Tony Robbins, Magic Johnson, Ted Leonsis, Steve Case, and Eric Lefkofsky. The chief executive officer is Bruce Stein, the former chief executive officer and chief operating officer of Mattel Toys, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Kenner Products (Hasbro). On September 27, 2016, aXiomatic announced that it had acquired controlling interest of esports organization Team Liquid.\nOther investors include Los Angeles Dodgers executives Lon Rosen and Tucker Kain, Golden State Warriors executives Rick Welts and Kirk Lacob, the Washington Nationals owners at Lerner Enterprises, Chicago Cubs president of business operations Crane Kenney, Donn Davis, co-founder of Revolution and managing partner of Revolution Growth, Zach Leonsis, VP and general manager of Monumental Sports Network, Mark Ein, founder and owner of the Washington Kastles and Washington Justice, and former NFL player Dhani Jones.\nIt was announced that Victor Goossens and Steve Arhancet would continue their roles as co-CEOs of Team Liquid after the acquisition.\nIn December 2021, five players signed by Team Liquid became co-owners: basketball player Aerial Powers, amateur Super Smash Bros. player (and actor) Asa \"Stimpy\" Butterfield, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player Jonathan \"EliGE\" Jablonowski, Super Smash Bros. player Juan \"Hungrybox' DeBiedma, and poker streamer and competitor Lex Veldhuis.\nIn January 2022, Team Liquid signed the World of Warcraft guild Limit, making Limit's guild leader and team captain Max \"Maximum\" Smith a co-owner.\nIn May 2024, it was announced that Team Liquid was a member of the Esports World Cup Foundation Club Support Program, funded by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. Later that same month, Team Liquid would sign two Mobile Legends: Bang Bang rosters in the form of AURA Esports and ECHO (renamed to Liquid AURA and Liquid ECHO, then to Team Liquid Indonesia and Team Liquid Philippines respectively), after they acquired STUN.GG, who owned both teams.\n\nWebsites\nMain websites\nTLnet ‚Äì Originally branded as \"Team Liquid\", the tl.net website primarily provides StarCraft II coverage but also has some coverage for StarCraft Brood War, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Heroes of the Storm, and Super Smash Brothers Melee. With the launch of StarCraft II, TLnet has grown into the largest StarCraft community on the internet, with over 220,000 active members and over twenty four million total posts. The website employs four person full-time staff at their New York City office to work on the site.\nTeam Liquid ‚Äì Website focusing on Team Liquid esports team coverage.\nLiquipedia ‚Äì Is a volunteer-run wiki covering various esports, beginning with Starcraft: Brood War and currently covering more than 57 esports titles. In 2023 Liquipedia started to branch into covering traditional sports with their Formula 1 wiki. In 2024, Liquipedia would host the game-focused Dota 2 Wiki, which previously was hosted on Fandom, with an intent to merge both the esports wiki and the game wiki into a single, comprehensive Dota 2 wiki.\n\nRosters\nTournaments and events\nIn addition to running a community site and team, Team Liquid also hosts a variety of tournaments and events.\n\nTeam Liquid Starleague\nThe two iterations of the TeamLiquid Starleague (or TSL for short) have been the largest StarCraft: Brood War tournaments outside of South Korea. The first TSL sponsored by Razer in 2008 was highly anticipated at the time, sporting all of the world's top Brood War players. It was topped one year later with 2009's TSL 2, which featured a total prize pool of over $20,000 and remains the largest non-Korean Brood War tournament to date.\nWith the release of Starcraft II, Team Liquid announced a third installment, sponsored again by PokerStrategy.com with a prize pool of $34,700.  The tournament took place between March and May 2011. On April 25, 2012, a fourth installment was announced (TSL 4).\n\nTeam Liquid StarCraft II Open\nThe TL Opens are one-day open single-elimination tournaments alternating between the NA and EU battle.net servers. The eight TL Open events that lead up to the TSL 3 also served as a qualifier for the TSL.\n\nTeam Liquid Legacy Starleague\nAnnounced on January 1, 2013, Team Liquid would be hosting a series of online tournaments for \"foreign\" players of StarCraft: Brood War.\n\nCommunity events\nTL Attack: Modeled after a Korean TV show called Bnet Attack, a professional player plays games against non-professionals while chatting with the hosts.\nLiquibition: A King-of-the-Hill mode that is played best of 7 games.\nTL Arena: A professional player will be matched up with inferior opponents. With each win he gains, another handicap is added that limits his game play options, until he loses or he has defeated a certain number of opponents.\n\nEsports history\nStarCraft and StarCraft II\nThe gaming clan \"Liquid\" was founded by Victor \"Nazgul\" Goossens near the end of 2000, after he decided to leave his previous clan. Liquid started with four members for the first months and grew to eight players over the following year. The members of the Liquid clan were handpicked by Goossens.\nWith the arrival of StarCraft II, Team Liquid announced plans to become an active professional esports team. Shortly after, sponsorship by The Little App Factory was announced, which qualified them as a sponsored professional team. This allowed Team Liquid to pay their players a salary and send the team to events around the world. The team created a dedicated news site separate from the more community oriented site, announced and released on May 10, 2011.\nOn August 13, 2012, three players traveled to Korea in order to live in the OGS training house and compete in GOMTV's Global StarCraft II League (GSL).\nOf the three players entering the preliminaries, only one, Dario \"TLO\" W√ºnsch qualified for the first two GSL events. He was eliminated out in the Second and First rounds respectively.\nThe third GSL was the strongest showing of Team Liquid thus far. Three players, Hayder \"Haypro\" Hussein, Jos \"Ret\" de Kroon and Jonathan \"Jinro\" Walsh qualified for the main tournament. While Hussein lost first round and de Kroon in 2nd, Walsh made to the semi-finals, losing 0‚Äì4 to the eventual winner Jang \"MC\" Min-Chul.\nIn 2012, during GSL Season 2, members Song \"HerO\" Hyeon Deok and Yun \"TaeJa\" Young Seo made it to the Round of 8 of the Code S tournament, with TaeJa being eliminated while HerO advanced to the semi-finals of the tournament.\nAt the end of 2023, Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook and Cl√©ment \"Clem\" Desplanches reached the semifinals of ESL SC2 Masters: Winter 2023 Finals, at Dreamhack Atlanta. Cure lost to Dark 3-1 while Clem defeated Serral 3-1 and reached the finals. In the grand final, Clem competed against Dark and beat him 4-1.\nAt the start of 2024, Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook was eliminated in the Round of 8 of Master's Coliseum 7, losing 3-4 against Solar.  \nIn February 2024, Cl√©ment \"Clem\" Desplanches reached the Quarterfinals in IEM Katowice 2024 but lost 3-0 against Serral.  \nIn February 2024, Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook reached the Semifinals in IEM Katowice 2024 but lost 3-0 against Maru.  \nCl√©ment \"Clem\" Desplanches has assured his direct spot in the Esports World Cup 2024 in Riyadh by winning SC2 Masters Winter 2023.  \nKim \"Cure\" Doh-wook has assured his direct spot in the Esports World Cup 2024 in Riyadh by reaching top 4 at IEM Katowice 2024.  \nBoth Cl√©ment \"Clem\" Desplanches and Kim \"Cure\" Doh-wook stopped in the Knockout Round 3 of ESL SC2 Masters: Spring 2024. Clem lost 3-0 to HerO while Cure lost 3-2 to Shin.\n\nSmash Bros.\nIn March 2014, Team Liquid announced that it had picked up two Melee players: Ken, who is known as the \"King of Smash\" and KoreanDJ, who is known for being the first player to defeat Mew2King during his peak, thus starting its Smash team. After acquiring Curse Gaming, it also signed Hungrybox, who is considered to be one of the Five Gods of Melee, and Chillin, who was the first player to defeat Ken during his prime. On August 11, 2015, it picked up top Super Smash Bros. for Wii U player Nairo, who was the only player to knock ZeRo out of a tournament, ending ZeRo's 55 win tournament streak at MLG World Finals. On September 28, 2015, Team Liquid announced that KoreanDJ resigned from the organization and retired from competitive Smash, citing persistent hand and wrist pains.\n\nLeague of Legends\nOn January 6, 2015, Liquid acquired the Team Curse's League of Legends roster, which consisted of Quas, IWillDominate, Voyboy, Cop, and Xpecial. The team finished the LCS Spring regular season in 6th place with a 10‚Äì9 record. On Week 5 and 6 of NA LCS Piglet was benched and replaced on the starting roster by KEITHMCBRIEF in an effort to try to improve their standings. In the playoffs they beat Counter Logic Gaming 3‚Äì0, before losing to Cloud9 3‚Äì2 and finishing in 3rd.\nTeam Liquid was very successful in 2018 and 2019, winning four LCS splits in a row.  In the 2018 NA LCS season, Liquid had a roster of Impact, Xmithie, Pobelter, Doublelift, and Olleh.  At the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, Liquid went 3‚Äì3 in groups and failed to advance.  In the 2019 LCS season, Liquid replaced Pobelter with Jensen and Olleh with CoreJJ.  Liquid failed to make it out of groups at the 2019 League of Legends World Championship, however, as their 3‚Äì3 record was insufficient to advance.  In 2020, Broxah joined the team as jungler, replacing Xmithie.  The 2020 Spring Split went very poorly for Liquid; they finished ninth place out of ten.  Doublelift was benched due to motivation issues and replaced by Academy ADC Tactical, and Doublelift was eventually traded to Team SoloMid for the summer split, with Tactical promoted to starter.  Liquid finished third that summer split and made it to 2020 League of Legends World Championship, but again their 3‚Äì3 record was insufficient to advance to the quarterfinals.  In 2021, Santorin replaced Broxah as jungler, and LEC import Alphari replaced Impact as top laner.  The team once again got a 3‚Äì3 record in groups at the 2021 League of Legends World Championship; this qualified them for a tiebreaker match with Gen.G, but Liquid lost and failed to advance.\nThe 2022 season saw a major shake-up of the roster, as the Honda sponsorship allowed the creation of a \"super team\" of Bwipo, Santorin, Bjergsen, Hans Sama, and CoreJJ.  Despite high expectations and finishing third place in the regular season of the summer split, Liquid narrowly failed to earn a Worlds slot in the playoffs, a disappointment that caused a major controversy. Hans Sama left the team at the end of the season. On 26 September 2022 they also released Guilhoto from the head coach position.\n\nOther\nOne week after the Curse merger, it was announced that Team Liquid acquired a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team that previously played under the title \"Denial eSports\".\nOn October 9, 2015, it was announced that Liquid would once again be fielding a Dota team, after being absence from the competitive DotA scene for more than a year.\nOn October 21, 2016, it was announced that Liquid would be fielding a professional Civilization VI team, captained by former world champion Civilization player MrGameTheory.\nOn August 7, 2020, Team Liquid announced their entrance to the Valorant esports scene by signing the fish123 roster, soulcas, Kryptix, L1NK, ec1s. Alongside these four players, they also added ScreaM as the fifth player. On February 24, 2021, Team Liquid parted ways with ec1s and added Jamppi into the roster.  On April 23, 2021, Team Liquid announced changes to their Dota 2 roster on Twitter. Samuel \"Boxi\" Swann is taking a break from Dota to spend more time with his family. He will be replaced by Saeed Samail \"SumaiL\" Hassan. On December 25, 2021, analyst and translator Leon \"Arthur\" Lee interviewed Team Liquid coach, William \"Blitz\" Lee, who talked about the formation of the team, MATUMBAMAN and Zai, captain iNSaNiA and opponents at the Dota Pro Circuit. On 22 September 2022, they were announced as one of the 10 partner teams for the Valorant EMEA league.\nOn May 5, 2023, Team Liquid became the first Dota 2 team to score the minimum number of DPC points and qualify for The International 2023.\nOn November 21, 2023, Team Liquid announced its departure from Rocket League.\nIn May 2024, Team Liquid announced it was officially re-entering competitive Apex Legends play after signing the orgless team \"Legacy\" ahead of the 2024 Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) Split 1 Playoffs LAN. It marked Team Liquid's return to the Apex scene, after leaving in December 2022. The roster is made up of Saul \"YanYa\" Ocampo, Luis Enrique \"Neazul\" Ramos Suarez, Alexis \"Jaguares\" Martinez, and Steven \"Pistillo\" Rojas as the coach.\nOn February 13, 2025, Team Liquid entered chess by signing American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana. The next day, on February 14, Liquid signed the Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen. Both players will represent Liquid during the Champions Chess Tour 2025.\n\nSponsors\nOn January 24, 2015, it was announced that HTC had become an official sponsor of Team Liquid.\nIn June 2022, Liquid got Honda as a major sponsor for their League of Legends team.  The League team was renamed \"Team Liquid Honda\" as a result.\n\nManagement\nVictor \"Nazgul\" Goossens is a founding member, and currently co-owner and chief executive officer of Team Liquid. He originally competed in Brood War prior to forming Team Liquid.\nSteve \"LiQuiD112\" Arhancet joined the Team Liquid staff when Team Curse merged with Team Liquid. Since the merge, Steve has taken the role of co-owner and chief executive officer and primarily manages the League of Legends team.\n\nAlienware Training Facility\nIn 2017 Team Liquid finished constructing its Alienware Training Facility in Los Angeles, which is designed to act as the training grounds for Team Liquid's CS:GO and League of Legends teams, as well as their esports headquarters. The facility houses non-players such as owner Steve \"LiQuiD112\" Arhancet and 1UP Studios, Team Liquid's in-house production studio, so that all departments of Team Liquid could work together. Team Liquid's sponsor Alienware supplied all the PC's to the Alienware Training Facility.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Rachell \"Rae\" Marie Hofstetter (born January 8, 1992), better known as Valkyrae, is an American online streamer and YouTuber. She is a co-owner of the gaming organization 100 Thieves and founder and CEO of the media company Hihi Studios. \nHofstetter began streaming on Twitch in 2015. She had her breakthrough by playing the competitive online game Fortnite in 2018 and joined 100 Thieves as their first female content creator. In 2020, she switched streaming platforms by signing an exclusive contract with YouTube. Later that year, she saw significant follower growth and reached her peak viewership when playing the online social deduction game Among Us, which led to her winning the Game Award for \"Content Creator of the Year\" and the Streamy Award for best live streamer. She was also named \"Gaming Creator of the Year\" by Adweek in 2021 and was included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.\n\nEarly life\nRachell Marie Hofstetter was born on January 8, 1992, and grew up in Moses Lake, Washington. She is of Filipino and German descent and has three brothers and one younger sister. She cites her mother as the reason she became interested in video games, who encouraged her to pursue it as a hobby from a young age. She attended community college and worked a job at GameStop to support herself, later graduating with an associate degree in arts and science.\n\nCareer\n2015‚Äì2019: Early career, initial popularity, and joining 100 Thieves\nWhile working at GameStop, Hofstetter began sharing her gaming hobby on Instagram, gaining a following. After being encouraged by her followers, she started live streaming on Twitch in 2015. She later began uploading her gaming content to YouTube and had her breakthrough by playing the competitive online game Fortnite in 2018. That October, she became the first female content creator for the gaming organization 100 Thieves.

In her first three months on YouTube, she averaged around 1,500 concurrent viewers. Her stream then experienced significant growth and, in late 2020, regularly peaked at concurrent viewer counts exceeding 100,000. This was driven by her playing the online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us and collaborating with popular streamers like Disguised Toast, Sykkuno, Pokimane, PewDiePie, and Cr1TiKaL, in addition to public figures like politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, musician Lil Nas X, and television personality Jimmy Fallon. Hofstetter became the fastest-growing female streamer of 2020 and surpassed Pokimane as the year's most-viewed female streamer. In December 2020, she won Content Creator of the Year award at the 2020 Game Awards.\nOn April 7, 2021, Hofstetter and CouRageJD joined the ownership group of 100 Thieves, alongside Dan Gilbert, Scooter Braun, Drake, and its founder, Nadeshot. As co-owners, they received equity in the company, which Forbes valued at $190 million at the time. In May 2021, she won Gaming Creator of the Year award at the 2021 Adweek Creator Visionary Awards. Throughout 2021, she made appearances in music videos for \"DayWalker\" by Machine Gun Kelly featuring Corpse Husband, as well as \"Build a Bitch\" and \"Inferno\" by Bella Poarch.

In May 2024, Hofstetter's streaming heavily involved playing a character on the modded Grand Theft Auto V roleplaying server NoPixel. Later that month, she was named among Gold House A100 honorees. In July 2024, she participated in the MrBeast video \"50 YouTubers Fight for $1,000,000\". In September 2024, Hofstetter founded the media company Hihi Studios to \"develop and produce IP for graphic novels, TV and film projects with a specific emphasis on anime-inspired content.\" In October 2024, Hofstetter launched her podcast Press Esc with artist Alyssa \"Alythuh\" Dios as her co-host. In December 2024, she was nominated for The Sapphire Award at the fourth annual Streamer Awards.\n\n2025‚Äìpresent: Return to Twitch\nBy January 2025, Hofstetter's exclusive streaming contract with YouTube had expired. She returned to Twitch on January 8, while celebrating her 10th streaming anniversary and her 33rd birthday. During her first week, she was the most-watched female streamer on Twitch, based on hours watched. \nOn February 24, 2025, Hofstetter began a week-long IRL streaming marathon in Los Angeles with fellow streamer Brittany \"Cinna\" Watts titled Sis-A-Thon. Hoffstetter and Watts had planned on holding the marathon in January, but it was postponed due to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires. On March 2, the final night of the marathon, Hoffstetter, Watts, and their guest Emily \"Emiru\" Schunk, were targeted by a stalker at Pacific Park on the Santa Monica Pier. A man, who introduced himself as \"Russell\", had approached the live streamers and asked Emiru for her phone number, who declined but offered to take a photo with him. The man would change clothes and reapproach the women again over a half hour later, asking Emiru for her number after they got off the Ferris wheel. The man became aggressive after they told him no again, threatening to kill the streamers and requiring to be held back by Cinna's cameraman Rosii as they called for park security. The streamers ended the marathon early and contacted the police, Hofstetter tweeting the following morning: \"We are all ok and have been with police. We decided we are done with the marathon and need time to process! Thank you for all the love and support this past week, we had so much fun and hope you all enjoyed. That end of marathon brunch stream we had planned tomorrow with friends will be rescheduled for sometime in the far future :‚Äô) Please send love to emiru, Cinna, Rosie [sic] and Emily! Everybody is in shock but I‚Äôm so glad were [sic] together\". Later that day, Hofstetter and Watts went live to address the incident and officially conclude the marathon.\n\nOther activities\nPhilanthropy\nOn April 6, 2021, Hofstetter participated in an Among Us charity livestream held by The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon with several notable celebrities  such as Gaten Matarazzo and Noah Schnapp of Stranger Things, American hip-hop band The Roots members Questlove, Black Thought, and Captain Kirk Douglas, and fellow streamers and YouTubers Sykkuno and Corpse Husband. The event raised over $25,000 for Feeding America.\nIn June 2022, Hofstetter participated in a Minecraft charity tournament held by the MC Championship with several other creators to raise money for The Trevor Project. Hofstetter also donated $10,000 towards the charity. In late November 2022, Hofstetter donated $15,000 towards No Kid Hungry during Ludwig Ahgren's charity event. In December 2022, Hofstetter participated in \"Thankmas\", an annual charity livestream event hosted by YouTuber jacksepticeye, to raise money for World Central Kitchen. The event raised over $10 million in donations.\nHofstetter donated $10,000 towards the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023.\n\nRFLCT and controversy\nOn October 19, 2021, Hofstetter announced the launch of her skincare brand, RFLCT. The brand, primarily geared towards gamers and those who put in heavy screen time, claimed that users are susceptible to skin damage caused by prolonged exposure to blue light and that their products protect against it.\nRFLCT received backlash due to insufficient evidence supporting the claim; according to Kathleen Suozzi, the director of the aesthetic dermatology program at Yale University, unless someone was already prone to melasma or hyperpigmentation, they were unlikely to suffer any consequence of sitting in front of a screen for long periods of time. Hofstetter responded by stating that \"all of the hate, doubt, concerns, and criticisms are all warranted and valid\" and that she was \"very upset and confused\" with the lack of information on its website, promising additional information supporting the products would be made available. She was later informed that the research conducted by RFLCT supporting the products‚Äîwhich she had been given access to during development‚Äîcould not be released to the public.\nHofstetter then expressed a desire to part ways with RFLCT but was contractually bound. On October 30, 2021, RFLCT ceased operation of its website and online store. A statement on the website read: \"While we believe in the formulations created, after further reflection, have decided to move forward on new paths, effectively terminating the RFLCT brand.\"\n\nPersonal life\nHofstetter resides in Los Angeles. From 2016 to 2021, she was in a relationship with fellow streamer Michael \"Sonii\" Sherman. From April 2023 to July 2024, she lived with fellow streamers Leslie \"Fuslie\" Fu, Miyoung \"Kkatamina\" Kim, and Christina \"TinaKitten\" Kenyan, collectively known as \"The Roomies\".\nHofstetter endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nMusic videos\nDiscography\nAwards and nominations\nListicles\nSee also\nList of YouTubers\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nValkyrae's channel on YouTube\nValkyrae at IMDb",

        "content": "Shroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to burial sheets, mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the Jewish tachrichim or Muslim kaffan, that the body is wrapped in for burial. A famous example of this is the Shroud of Turin.\nA traditional Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter shin, mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, due to the prohibition of Shaatnez. A pious Jewish man may next be enwrapped in either his kittel or his tallit, one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 mitzvot (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a sovev in Hebrew (a cognate of svivon, the spinning Hanukkah toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, dreidel), before being placed directly in the earth (or in a plain coffin of soft wood where it is required by governing health codes).\nThe Early Christian Church also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. Early Christian shrouds incorporated a cloth, the sudarium, that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or his friend, Lazarus (John 11, q.v.). An account of the opening of the coffin of Edward I says that the \"innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body\". The use of burial shrouds was general until at least the Renaissance ‚Äì for much of history, a new set of clothing was an expensive purchase, so preparing the deceased in this manner ensured that a good set of clothes could be retained for further use by the family.\nIn Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.\nOrthodox Christians still use a burial shroud, usually decorated with a cross and the Trisagion. The special shroud that is used during the Orthodox Holy Week services is called an Epitaphios. Some Christians also use the burial shroud, particularly the Catholics (Roman/Eastern), among others.\nMuslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen.  The Burying in Woollen Acts 1666‚Äì80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.\nShrouds can also be used for cremation ceremonies in either a funeral home or crematorium.\n\nSee also\nBody bag\nCoffin\nSudarium of Oviedo\nIslamic funeral\nUrn\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Shrouds at Wikimedia Commons",
