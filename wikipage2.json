His esports career began in 2016, during which he also started streaming regularly. He joined the\nDallas Fuel\n, a team competing in the inaugural season of the\nOverwatch League\n, in late 2017. However, his time with the Dallas Fuel was marred by controversy, resulting in repeated suspensions and ultimately his release from the team midway through the season. Additionally, Lengyel represented Team Canada in the\nOverwatch World Cup\nfrom 2017 to 2019.\nFollowing his departure from competitive\nOverwatch\n, Lengyel shifted his focus to a full-time streaming career on\nTwitch\n. During this period, he also signed with several esports organizations, such as\nSentinels\nand\nLuminosity Gaming\n, as a content creator. Throughout his streaming career, Lengyel has faced several bans and suspensions on Twitch for violating platform guidelines. These incidents involved showing explicit content, making offensive remarks, and engaging in\nstream sniping\n. Despite these controversies, Lengyel maintained a large and dedicated fanbase, consistently attracting high viewership numbers. He was the most-watched streamer on Twitch for three consecutive years, from 2020 to 2022. In June 2023, Lengyel signed a two-year, non-exclusive $100\nmillion deal to stream on\nKick\n.\nCareer\nEarly streaming\nAfter finishing\nhigh school\n, Lengyel enrolled in a\nCEGEP\n, studying\nbusiness administration\nuntil dropping out in second year after feeling \"directionless\". At the age of 19, Lengyel subsequently began streaming on the platform\nTwitch\n, where he initially played\nLeague of Legends\n(\nLoL\n) under the pseudonym\nxQcLoL\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThe name\nxQc\nwas derived from the last letter of his first name,\nx\n, combined with the abbreviation for his home province of Quebec,\nQC\n.\n[\n3\n]\nAs his streaming career progressed, Lengyel gained recognition and prominence primarily through his involvement with\nOverwatch\n, a video game developed by\nBlizzard Entertainment\n. Consequently, he adjusted his alias to xQcOW to reflect his association with\nOverwatch\n(\nOW\n).\n[\n2\n]\nEsports\nLengyel embarked on his professional esports career in\nOverwatch\nby initially competing in smaller online tournaments as a\ntank\nplayer for teams such as DatZit Gaming.\n[\n2\n]\nIn October 2016, he was recruited by\nDenial Esports\n, a prominent multi-game esports organization.\n[\n4\n]\nHowever, after a brief period, Denial disbanded, leading Lengyel and his former teammates to form an independent roster called Yikes, which later underwent a name change to Arc 6.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nDuring their tenure, the team participated in Season Zero of\nOverwatch Contenders\n, where Lengyel's competitive drive appeared to reach unhealthy levels. He acknowledged prioritizing gaming over fundamental aspects of life, such as sleep, nutrition, and pe",

He was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. He gained popularity in 2020 by making TikToks, then moved to Twitch to pursue a streaming career in late 2022. He joined FaZe Clan on May 1, 2024, along with three other members (Lacy, Plaqueboymax, and Silky) who joined the same week.\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nJason was born to Vietnamese parents in Dallas, Texas, but was raised by his aunt until his teenage years. He is a three-time Spelling Bee champion.\nCareer\n[\n]\nJason started making TikToks in early 2020, hoping for a viral hit. After achieving a few viral TikToks with his skits, which were usually considered \"cringe\". He began streaming on Twitch in late 2022.\nInitially, he focused on \"Just Chatting\" sessions, primarily with girls on Discord or playing Valorant with them. During this time, he met Mira, the main girl for following months. His content for the next few months largely remained the same, with different girls added to his \"roster.\" During this period, he continued posting clips of his streams on TikTok and gained an audience.\nDuring one of these Discord calls in early 2023, he met Yujin (o). After doing some streams together, they started dating.In 2023 his viewership mostly remained constant. Yujin and him mutually broke up in February 2024, which began the \"Bop arc,\" throughout the following months. The new roster included Sa, selena, alyssa and two other girls who shall not be named. His streams also included several community members from OSCS, VSB, etc.\nThe Bop arc ended a few days after his birthday week streams, which led to some drama, leaving several people blackballed in the following weeks.\nIn early May, he announced joining FaZe Clan and a plan for starting the Bop World Tour, with initial plans for New York, Toronto, Tokyo, Sydney, and London. However, the full tour never came to true as he moved to LA with the FaZe boys and slowed down on girl content. The tour ended with a cute girl from Toronto, a level 100 boss, and a thug from New York.\nAfter moving in with FaZe his content slightly changed, chilling and having fun in the FaZe house.\nCommunity content is available under\nCC-BY-SA\nunless otherwise noted.\nAdvertisement\nExplore properties\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFollow Us\nOverview\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCommunity\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nAdvertise\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFandom Apps\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nTwitch Streamers Wiki is a FANDOM Games Community.\nView Mobile Site",

He was infamous among other high ranking players for his skill in playing the character Draven, but also for his toxic behavior. He verbally abused teammates and intentionally lost the game after perceived slights from his teammates.\n[\n6\n]\nThis behavior eventually led to permanent bans on 22 unique accounts over several years.\n[\n7\n]\nSteinkamp later increased his toxic behavior in order to draw in more viewers. In April 2016 he produced a video compilation of his toxic behavior with a promise to reform. The video received over 2 million views on\nYouTube\n.\n[\n3\n]\nHis\nTwitch\nchannel increased from around 5,700 followers to over 92,000 followers by the end of the month. His improved behavior quickly lapsed but his following continued to grow, prompting high profile and professional players such as\nMeteos\nand\nDoublelift\nto publicly condemn his behavior.\n[\n8\n]\nOn April 30, 2016, Riot Games employee \"Riot Socrates\" announced that due to \"a well-documented history\" of verbal abuse and player harassment, Steinkamp would no longer be allowed to own a League of Legends account, adding, \"this dragged on too long, but we want you to know when the rare player comes along who's a genuine jerk, we've still got your back.\"\n[\n9\n]\nGoing forward, Riot would ban any account he played on, even if he had not yet broken any rules.\n[\n3\n]\n2016–2018: Variety content\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter becoming banned, Steinkamp continued to try to play\nLeague of Legends\n, but as soon as he publicly streamed himself playing, Riot Games would quickly discover it and ban his account.\n[\n6\n]\nHe also tried playing in his free time, repeatedly creating new accounts and climbing the competitive ladder before those too were discovered and banned.\n[\n3\n]\nUnable to play\nLeague of Legends\n, Steinkamp was forced to branch out to other games to entertain his viewers, such as\nPlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\n.\n[\n10\n]\nHe also hosted non-gaming streams such as cosplaying as\nBob Ross\n[\n11\n]\nand teaching his viewers how to cook.\n[\n6\n]\nDespite the ban, Steinkamp's following continued to grow, and he withdrew from university to focus on online content creation full time.\n[\n3\n]\nIn November 2017, Steinkamp hosted an online\nLeague of Legends\ntournament called the Tyler1 Championship Series",

Around September 2014, s1mple was signed by a large organisation known as Hellraisers.\n[\n7\n]\nThere, he joined ANGE1, Dosia, Kucher, and Markeloff, who s1mple considers his idol.\n[\n8\n]\n2015\n[\nedit\n]\nIn January 2015, s1mple was soon removed from Hellraisers due to his inflammatory comments about Germans, and an ESL wire ban for cheating.\n[\n9\n]\nS1mple himself says that the ban was from cheating in\nCounter-Strike 1.6\n.\n[\n10\n]\nHowever, records from ESL show that it was an in-game ban from when S1mple played CS:GO.\n[\n11\n]\nThis ban was also extended to 2016 due to ban evasion.\n[\n12\n]\nS1mple was soon after signed by Flipsid3 Tactics, but his time in the team would cut short due to the team's semi-final exit at ESWC 2015.

A Team Liquid player, Spencer \"Hiko\" Martin, was standing in for Flipsid3 at ESWC 2015, and he developed a friendly relationship with s1mple there.\n[\n15\n]\nTeam Liquid surprised at the first major, and reached the semifinals of\nMLG Major Championship: Columbus\n, before falling to the eventual champions, Luminosity Gaming.  Despite this result at the game's biggest tournament, it wouldn't be long before s1mple would leave Team Liquid, citing homesickness.  The next major of the year was approaching, and s1mple once again played for Team Liquid.\n[\n16\n]\nDuring the semifinals at\nESL One Cologne 2016\n,\nValve\nCorporation added a graffiti on Cache commemorating s1mple's falling AWP play against\nfnatic\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThus,\nTeam Liquid\nbecame the first North American team to reach a major final.  They were stopped in the finals by the same Brazilian lineup of\nSK\n(formerly Luminosity Gaming).\n[\n18\n]\nAfter leaving Team Liquid, he replaced Danylo \"Zeus\" Teslenko on Natus Vincere.\n[\n19\n]\nWith Na'Vi, s1mple won\nESL One: New York 2016\n, and he was awarded the #4 placement in the HLTV top 20.",

However, after the team failed to perform at a high level, TenZ was benched in October of that year.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nTenZ began full-time content creation in January 2020.\n[\n9\n]\nIn However, in April 2020, following the public beta release of\nRiot Games\n' first-person shooter\nValorant\n, TenZ announced his decision to retire from\nCS:GO\nand opted to transition into\nValorant\n, thereby becoming Cloud9's first professional player in the title.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nIn January 2021, TenZ announced his departure from professional\nValorant\nto focus on a career in content creation.\n[\n12\n]\nHowever, his hiatus was short-lived, as Cloud9 agreed to loan TenZ to\nSentinels\nin April 2021, following the suspension of Sentinels player\nSinatraa\n.\n[\n13\n]\nDuring the first two stages of the 2021\nValorant\nChampions Tour\n(VCT), TenZ competed remotely from Canada. Sentinels went on to win the first international\nValorant\ntournament, the VCT Stage 2 Masters Reykjavík after sweeping\nFnatic\nin the grand finals by a score of 3–0; TenZ was named the grand finals MVP.\n[\n14\n]\nOn June 2, 2021, Sentinels bought out TenZ's contract, reported to be valued between\nUS$1.25\nto $1.5\nmillion.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nAfter their first international trophy on May 30, 2021, TenZ and Sentinels would not win another trophy for almost 3 years.\nOn April 18, 2023, Sentinels head coach Adam Kaplan announced that TenZ would be temporarily benched due to illness and a hand injury.\n[\n17\n]\nOn March 24, 2024, TenZ achieved his second international trophy, winning VCT Masters Madrid alongside Sentinels by defeating\nGen.G\n3-2. With this win, he is the second\nValorant\nplayer to win two Masters trophies, and the only player to do so under the same organization. (Timofey \"Chronicle\" Khromov was the first to do so with\nGambit\nand\nFnatic\n.)\n[\n18\n]\nOn September 14, 2024, TenZ announced his retirement from professional\nValorant\nafter four years of competing.\nPersonal life\n[\nedit\n]\nNgo, born on May 5, 2001,\n[\n19\n]\nis from\nNanaimo\n, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and is of\nVietnamese\nand\nFrench\ndescent.\n[\n1\n]\nHe lived in Canada before moving to\nLos Angeles\nin January 2022.\n[\n14\n]\nNgo is currently engaged to\nKyedae Shymko\n, a content creator.

Progress is achieved by exploration and player choice, and how the player interacts with the world shapes the story line and the environment for the rest of the play-through. According to the Pirate Software website:\n\"\nEvery time you interact with an object, talk to an NPC, forget to turn off a light-switch, take out the trash, or disregard a sparkly bush the game remembers this and will change subtly for all further interactions. The greatest part about this design is that it already works and is in the current builds of the game. Both minor and major differences are going to pop up throughout the game and give the community something to share with one another. Everything you do matters no matter what kind of player you are or choose to be.\n\"\n[\n4\n]\nAlternate reality game\n[\nedit\n]\nA series of cryptographic puzzles can be solved outside of\nHeartbound\n, available from the game's website. These puzzles provide additional lore and offer an alternative narrative parallel to the game.

In 2024, she became the\nmost-subscribed Twitch streamer of all time\n, surpassing\nKai Cenat\n's first record during a September 2024 subathon, before being surpassed herself by Cenat during a November 2024 subathon.\n[\na\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nIronmouse originally planned to pursue a career as a\ncoloratura soprano\nopera\nsinger, but was diagnosed with\ncommon variable immunodeficiency\n(CVID), an\nimmune disorder\nthat has left her largely\nbedridden\nand isolated. It has also led to a lung infection called\nmycobacterium avium complex\nas she revealed to\nProjekt Melody\nin 2021.\n[\n6\n]\nThis required her to remain isolated from others, a situation which intensified in 2020 amid the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n.\n[\n7\n]\nIn 2017, she began to pursue a career as a\nstreamer\ninstead, as she was \"lonely and wanted something to do\".\n[\n7\n]\nHesitant to use her real face online, she was inspired by the Japanese entertainer\nKizuna AI\n, the first\nYouTuber\nto refer to themselves as a \"virtual YouTuber\"\n[\n8\n]\n—to stream with a digital avatar to conceal her identity.\n[\n7\n]\nHer username comes from the villain Sailor Iron Mouse from the manga series\nSailor Moon\n.\n[\n9\n]\nAfter discovering that there were a growing number of users referring to themselves as VTubers like Kizuna, she began to consider herself one. The Ironmouse persona was expanded into a character, which she referred to as a \"bigger version of me\" and being like a\nsuperhero\ncostume;\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nher avatar usually takes the form of a horned\ndemon\nwith pink and purple hair,\n[\n7\n]\nwhile its backstory—influenced by her having jokingly referred to herself on-stream as such—suggests that the character is a personification of\nSatan\nitself.\n[\n7\n]\nIronmouse's distinctive, high-pitched speaking voice is the result of a lung infection due to CVID complications which also resulted in her being on oxygen support 24/7; she has remarked that some people have refused to take her seriously because of her voice, and that some fellow streamers have been shocked to find out that it was her real voice, and not being manipulated with a\nvoice changer\n.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n12\n]\nAmid a growth trend for streamers in general, and especially VTubers,\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nIronmouse's audience on Twitch began to see increases over 2020 and 2021. The increasing revenue from her streams also allowed her to afford higher-quality health care. In turn, improvements to her condition enabled her to perform longer streams on a more regular basis.\n[\n7\n]\nIn November 2020, Ironmouse was announced as one of the charter members of\nVShojo\n, a new U.S.-based\nagency\nof English-language VTubers, joining other streamers and personalities such as Nyanners and\nProjekt Melody\n.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nCDawgVA\n(seated, left) and Ironmouse (on screen) during a panel for\nAnime Expo\nin 2024\nIronmouse is known for her frequent collaborations with Welsh YouTuber\nCDawgVA\n; he had learned of VTubers via\nGigguk\n—one of his colleagues on the\nTrash Taste\npodcast.

She makes videos about her life in South Korea.\nAfter spending three months self-studying\nKorean\nin Hong Kong, Mira moved in 2015 to South Korea, where she took classes at\nSogang University\n's\nlanguage school\n. In 2016, she started a YouTube channel called \"Mira's Garden\", where she covered life in South Korea, South Korean culture, and her travels. At the beginning of 2021, she founded Mongcow, an\ne-commerce\nbusiness where she sold Mira-curated South Korean products and Mira-branded products. In November 2021, Mira started Hong Kong Fusion, a Hong Kong-style restaurant in\nSeoul\n. That year, her YouTube channel was the seventh most-subscribed Hong Kong YouTube channel with 730,000 subscribers.\nEarly life and education\n[\nedit\n]\nMira was born on 7 October 1992 in Hong Kong.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nShe recalled that when she was six or seven years old, her mother went out to buy food and was able to purchase only a small box of\nchar siu rice\n.\n[\n5\n]\nLooking back on that incident, she reflected that her family's finances during her youth were in a challenging state.\n[\n5\n]\nWhile living in Hong Kong, she self-studied the\nKorean language\nfor three months before moving to South Korea, where she studied at\nSogang University\n's\nlanguage school\nfor half a year in 2014.\n[\na\n]\nHer interest in learning the Korean language was inspired by encounters with South Korean customers while she was working in Hong Kong. She learned the language out of personal interest and did not have any plans about what to do with that knowledge.\n[\n6\n]\nAfter finishing her studies at Sogang University, she returned to Hong Kong for a year before going back to live in South Korea in 2016.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n8\n]\nBy 2018, she had become fluent in Korean.\n[\n6\n]\nYouTube channel and career\n[\nedit\n]\nMira's South Korea lifestyle vlog published on 27 February 2020. In the video, she deals with a Korean visa, meets with a YouTube manager, shops online, responds to YouTube comments, and cooks and eats food.\nMira started a YouTube channel in June 2016.\n[\n5\n]\nIn a rush to create the YouTube channel, she chose the name \"Mira's Garden\" because she wanted to create a space that was her own. A previous channel she considered was \"Mira's Secret\". Mira said that a downside in her choice of channel name was that including an\napostrophe\nmade it harder to search for. She observed other people use their first name and surname as their YouTube channels. Despite harbouring regret over her choice of channel name, Mira decided to keep it unchanged owing to the long time she had used it.\n[\n6\n]\nAt its inception, the channel covered her life in South Korea before discussing her travels to other places in the region.\n[\n6\n]\nShe covered food and South Korean culture in her videos.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n9\n]\nVideo topics include how to become acquaintances with a Korean \"oppa\" and reasons a person should not date Korean men.\n[\n6\n]\nIn 2017, she visited a juice store in\nJiufen\nin Taiwan, to purchase red\nguava\njuice.

His name was \"Ko\", which I later learned was a traditional Hawaiian name. It always stuck with me as an interesting name, as I'd never heard anything like it before that time. I didn't really think about it and a couple years went by. Around the time I started Everquest 1, I needed to make a new name. Something that I knew I'd use for a long time. After playing around with the spelling and length requirements (4 letters), I came up with the name \"Cohh\". I've been using it ever since.\nDaytime job? - I stream fulltime but I am also the Lead Designer for an up-coming computer game -\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProjectResurgence\n- a CRPG! The game is in development with a team from around the world, eventually we will do a kickstarter or similar campaign and when this happens I will talk a LOT more on the stream about the game. For now, I'll say \"Arcanum-like\"!\nEducation/Work Experiences? - I've studied Game Design at Full Sail University - but because streaming took off, I stopped after 2 years. I plan on eventually taking the last year or so of coursework for a degree in the future. ",

The game is\nfree-to-play\nwith a current lineup of 37 characters from\nMarvel Comics\n, and features cross-play across all supported platforms.

As offense, the objective is to escort a cart or moving object through the map by capturing it, while defender must stop the objective by eliminating the offensive and recapturing it. If the offensive team escorts the convoy to the end of the map within a time limit, they win. When the attackers capture the object, it starts to move forward without the need of the respective team to stand near it, in case of which it travels at a faster speed. After the defender recaptures the vehicle, it starts to move backwards unless any of the attackers stand near its designated area. In competitive mode, once the attacking team has progressed as far as they can, the roles are swapped and the other team tries to better their effort. If both teams clear all checkpoints, the game restarts with the leftover time for both teams being used for another attempt until a victor has been decided.\nDomination – Both teams attack a single point on one of a handful of small maps. Once a point is captured, the defending team will slowly gain points until reaching 100% on which the round ends. The mode will then jump to another small map and repeat the objective. The first team to reach two captured points wins.\nConvergence – Teams will randomly be assigned offense or defense. As offense, the objective is to attack the first checkpoint on the map and secure it by standing inside. As defense, the objective is to defend the checkpoint until the match timer reaches zero. If the offense successfully captures the checkpoint in time, the mode shifts into Convoy style, where the attacking team escorts a cart or moving object through the map in an attempt to reach two further checkpoints. Reaching the final checkpoint is considered victory. Like Convoy, in competitive, both teams attempt to set the best progress and if both reach the final objective, further attempts are made with the remaining time.\nConquest – Players are divided into two teams. Eliminating any hero will drop points on the ground tha",

At a young age, my parents instilled in me that I could accomplish anything I set my mind to,\nso set my mind I did.\nAt 9 years old I became obsessed with my school’s ‘Milers-Club’ — a club that tracked the distance we ran during our lunch breaks and ranked us on a leaderboard. I was captivated. Each day, each mile, each step; a conscious choice to push myself further. At the beginning of the school year I envisioned my name at the top of the leaderboard, and I knew that with enough work, I could turn this vision into a reality. After pushing myself daily for an entire year, I ended up ranking #1.\nThis laid the groundwork for a powerful realization: hard, consistent work will yield results.\nAt 12 years old, I began playing World of Warcraft, a game that changed my life forever. WoW fascinated me, consumed me, to a level I could not yet comprehend. WoW also had a leaderboard, this time, on a global scale. Now, a new challenge presented itself; with millions of players ranking against one another, could I be the best?\nI set up my day in order to progress in WoW, i.e. I finished my homework during my lunch hour, ran home from school, and completed my chores as fast as possible in order to practice longer. My idea of a fun weekend consisted of my laptop and logging in to a world with infinite potential —\nI lived and breathed WoW.\nAfter many, many years of dedicated practice (and many, many failures) I became a top ranked player.\nAt 18 years old, I created a Twitch account and began livestreaming the process of playing World of Warcraft at a top level. Sharing what I learned to as many people around the world became my new passion. I streamed an average of 50 hours per week throughout college (with some weeks streaming as much as 60-70 hours). As climbing the leaderboards in WoW and livestreaming consumed my days, my life became more and more one-dimensional.\nSomething was missing.\nAt 20 years old, during my sophomore year of college, I hit a breaking point.\nAlthough I was pushing my mind each day, my body was growing weaker.\nI looked at myself in the mirror: I looked frail at 100 lbs, I had little to no muscle mass, my immune system was weak, and my nutrition was poor — I was unhealthy. This had to change. I spent the next few years diving into the scientific literature behind building a strong and capable body. A new challenge stared me in the face, can I maximize the potential of my body while maintaining a top ranking in the game?\n\"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable\"\n-Socrates\nIt wasn’t long into my fitness journey that I realized\nthe world of gaming and the world of fitness weren’t all that different;\nin both worlds I was addicted to the exact same thing — progression, getting better. After delving into the many myths of the fitness industry (I.e. fad diets, no days off, and useless supplements) I slowly discovered what wasn’t effective. After reaching both extremes in the gym and in the kitchen, I found a regimen that worked for me, delivered results, and a methodology I could adhere to.\nAt 25 years old, I thought my life was fairly balanced; gaming all through the night, waking up in the late afternoon to train, and repeating this (with no days off) for months, and months, and months on end. I was making progress in the gym, and the stream was doing great, but it wasn’t until meeting the girl of my dreams, that I realized the inherent imbalances of my lifestyle.\nI wasn’t sleeping on a normal schedule, socializing, prioritizing family time, taking time to step back and reflect.\nWithin months of meeting Shannon, this all changed. I was sleeping at a normal time, waking up early, working on other aspects of the business together during the day, and sharing my gaming knowledge in the afternoons.\nTogether, we spent the next year creating three products that we truly believe will merge the worlds of gaming and health closer together:\nThe Xaryu Fundamentals\n,\nThe Xaryu Cookbook\n, and\nThe Xaryu Bodyweight Program\n.\nIn a world where gaming is becoming an increasing part of our youth’s childhood, I want to shake up the mold and show that\nyou can be healthy and a top level gamer.\nSubscribe\nMENU\nMY STORY\nBLOG\nSHOP\nDAILIES\nEXTRAS\nWALLPAPERS\nPRESS\nCONTACT\nDISCLAIMER\nPOLICIES\n",

HutchMF is also colorblind and can only see black and white so he only ever wears those colors on stream.\nHutch is a sponsored ambassador of ARENA BREAKOUT INFINITE and has unlimited beta keys so just ask him, he is also well known for saying players tank headshots from him armor piercing Ammo when in fact he just misses a lot, only sometimes.\nHe also has no nipples. It's a debate between him and Summit1g on who has less nipples. To this day, it is an unsolved mystery.\nHutch also sucks at videogames.\nHe also left foam in his PC for months and has the spelling ability of a 2nd grader, with such classics as \"Capitors\"\nHe once got into a fight with a pillow and unfortunately the pillow won in hand to hand combat.\nWhen he was younger he would put latex gloves on his hands and inflate them just so they looked alot bigger than were.  To this day he wears flesh colored latex gloves that are inflated.\nKnow for complaining in Takrov and stinking.

Twitch stated that they made the decision to close the game to \"invest in broader tools and music services.\"\n[\n1\n]\nDevelopment\n[\nedit\n]\nIn October 2018 during\nTwitchCon\n, Twitch announced that they'd developed a karaoke video game in collaboration with Harmonix.\n[\n2\n]\nDuring the opening keynote, Twitch CEO\nEmmett Shear\nstated, \"We believe in a new category of game that’s made to be streamed, where the audience isn’t just nice to have, they’re crucial to the experience, where the driver’s seat is big enough for your whole community. So we teamed up with Harmonix and built a game ourselves.\"\n[\n3\n]\nAttendees at the convention were among the first to test out the game.\n[\n4\n]\nAn open beta would be launched later that month.\n[\n5\n]\nTwitch Sings\nwas released to the public on April 13, 2019 for\nMicrosoft Windows\nand\nmacOS\n. Mobile versions for\niOS\nand\nAndroid\nwere originally planned, but was never released.\n[\n6\n]\nOver 2,000 songs were available at launch.\n[\n7\n]\nOn September 4, 2020, Twitch announced that they would be closing\nTwitch Sings\nby 2021.\n[\n8\n]\nThe platform removed videos and clips relating to the game on December 1, 2020, citing contractual obligations.\n[\n9\n]\nTwitch Sings'\nservers were fully shut down on January 1, 2021.\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nTwitch Sings\nfeatured both single-player and multiplayer game modes. The main objective of the game was to sing a song as accurately as possible. A pitch meter helped players stay on key.  Players could sing solo songs live, or create a duet with a fellow creator. In order to perform a duet, a player would record one half of a song. They would later send a video of their performance to another player who sings the second half of the song. The game's software would later merge the two videos into one song.\n[\n10\n]\nIn a later update, Twitch added the ability to sing duets in real-time through a new party mode feature. Broadcasters were able to directly stream from the game. This allowed stream audiences to interact in various ways, such as voting on singing challenges for the broadcaster to attempt, along with sending in virtual ovations if they enjoyed the performance.\n[\n11\n]\nPlayers were able to adjust their game experience in a variety of ways. They could either use their webcam or a customizable avatar to represent themselves once in game.\n[\n12\n]\nA number of different voice effects and world maps were also offered to players.\n[\n13\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nStassan, Murray (7 September 2020).\n\"Spotify appears to be building a karaoke feature – just as Twitch shuts down Sings\"\n.\nMusic Business Worldwide\n.

The first Genesis tournament took place in 2009 in\nAntioch\nat the Contra Costa County Fairgrounds.\nAlongside\nEVO\nand\nThe Big House\n, the GENESIS series is considered to be one of the largest and most prestigious\nSuper Smash Bros.\ntournament series.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n2009–2011\n[\nedit\n]\nThe first iteration,\nGENESIS\n, took place in\nAntioch\n, California, beginning on July 10, 2009. The tournament was organized by Boback Vakili and the Concord-based DBR crew. At the time, it was the largest Melee tournament in history and the fifth largest Brawl tournament. The tournament featured players from around the world, including the US, Sweden, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.\nMelee\nsingles was won by\nJoseph \"Mango\" Marquez\n. This would mark\nAdam \"Armada\" Lindgren\n's first time playing in the United States and is considered the beginning of his rivalry with Mango. Melee doubles was won by the duo of\nJason \"Mew2King\" Zimmerman\nand Jman, Brawl singles was won by Ally, and Brawl doubles was won by Mew2King and Fiction.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nGENESIS 2\nwas held two years later from July 15–17, 2011. It was once again hosted by Vakili and DBR in Antioch. This tournament added brackets for the original\nSuper Smash Bros.\nand\nProject M\n, in addition to Melee and Brawl. It was sponsored by\nRed Bull\nand SABERGAMING.\nMelee\nsingles was won by Armada in a rematch against Mango in Grand Finals, and doubles was won by Mango and Jose \"Lucky\" Angel Aldama.\nBrawl\nsingles was won by Mew2King over Elliot \"Ally\" Bastien Carroza Oyarce, who won the doubles bracket together. Smash 64 singles was won by Canadian player Daniel \"SuPeRbOoMfAn\" Hoyt and Project M singles was won by Roustane \"Kage\" Benzeguir.\n[\n3\n]\nGenesis 2 was subject to a theft scandal that took place on its final day. DBR member Robert \"Zelgadis\" Scherer stole prize money that was accidentally left in a hotel room. When accused, he denied doing so, although he confessed and returned the money after police involvement.

It also offers music broadcasts, creative content, and \"in\nreal life\n\" streams. Twitch is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of\nAmazon\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIt was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform\nJustin.tv\n.\n[\n6\n]\nContent on the site can be viewed either live or via\nvideo on demand\n. The games shown on Twitch's current\n[update]\nhomepage are listed according to audience preference and include genres such as real-time strategy games, fighting games, racing games, and first-person shooters.\n[\n7\n]\nThe popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of Justin.tv. In October 2013, the website had 45 million unique viewers,\n[\n8\n]\nand by February 2014, it was considered the fourth-largest source of peak\nInternet\ntraffic in the United States.

Go to\nhttps://ferrets.piratesoftware.wiki/wiki/Ferrets\nto see all the information regarding the ferrets.\nLore\nThor\nand\nShaye\nrun a ferret sanctuary in Washington state, USA called Snail's House. This is a forever home for ferrets surrendered to the rescue. These ferrets are acquired through people who reach out and are no longer able to financially or physically care for their ferrets typically due to the ferret's medical needs.\nShaye is an exotic vet assistant who does majority of the care for the ferrets, including medicine, treatments, and all around enrichment for them while they reside at the sanctuary.\nThor does research on new treatments and nutrition to make sure the ferrets are in tip-top shape.\nThis is funded directly from the ad revenue generated on the Twitch\nlive stream\nwhere you can watch them 24/7, including play time 1-2x daily. All ad revenue goes towards food, toys, and most importantly medical care for the ferrets. The stream started on March 9th, 2023.\nThe rescue currently houses ferrets, in various stages of life. See the pictures/pages below for more information about each ferret!\nThere is also two wishlists for necessities and toys for the ferrets:\nThrone Wishlist\nand\nAmazon Wishlist\nFuture plans\nSnail's House is currently in the expansion phase of the rescue, hoping to house up to 250 ferrets by the time the real rescue building is built and constructed.\nIn the following youtube video Thor gives a 9 minute explanation about what the rescue does and the future plans for it:\nLink\nFerret merchandise\nHe is long, he is fluff, and he can bend around your neck as a pillow!\nBeans\nloves to join you on all your travels and he's really photogenic! Get your own ferret plush to cuddle while watching the ferrets on the stream. Checkout the merch site to order your own 2ft long plush of\nBeans\n.\n100% of the revenue of the plush sales will go to the ferret rescue.\nPlaygroups\nAs can be seen below the ferrets are separated into playgroups. When playtime happens the ferrets are let out according to their playgroups. This is because not all ferrets play well together or have the same energy level.\nFor example the Oldies like to take things slow, just eat their soup and then either waddle around a bit or find a place to chill. Compared to them, the Babies (younger ferrets) are extremely active and quickly overshadow the chill atmosphere the oldies prefer. There also could be different reasons for separating the ferrets into a group, like one of the ferrets of a group (they joined the rescue with) is overly aggressive towards other ferrets not of their group. Then the decision could be made to give this group a separate playtime.\nWith the exception of\nGhost\n(due to behavioural issues), being put into a playgroup does not mean they will never interact with ferrets from other playgroups.\nIn the media\nDate\nSource\nLink\n2024/05/27\nfranticshanti.com\nLink\n2024/09/20\nTwitch.tv Twitchcon 2024 (San Diego)\nLink\n2024/12/15\nBao and Friend Visit the Rescue\nLink\nWiki migration\nThe ferrets have gotten their own wiki space.

Since 2015, it has been handled by Games Done Quick, LLC.\n[\n2\n]\nHeld since 2010, the events have raised money for several charities.\nThe two flagship events held by Games Done Quick are Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), held in early January every year, which raises money for the\nPrevent Cancer Foundation\n, and Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ), usually held in late June or early July every year, which raises money for\nDoctors Without Borders\n. Both events last for seven days. In addition to these events, GDQ hosts several other broadcasts throughout the year, including smaller marathons supporting different charities, one-off events for special occasions, and regular GDQ Hotfix programming throughout the year.\nThe events are broadcast live on\nTwitch\n. Viewers are encouraged to donate for incentives during the stream such as selecting the file name or main character's name in a run, having the runners attempt more difficult challenges, and entering sweepstakes for the chance of winning prizes.\n[\n3\n]\nAs of January 2025, over $54.4 million has been raised across 47 marathons through almost a million individual donations.\n[\n4\n]\nFormat\n[\nedit\n]\nAttendees at Summer Games Done Quick 2019\nSpeedrunners\ntake turns demonstrating their prowess at beating various video games in the quickest possible time, done in front of an audience as well as a\nlivestream\nthrough\nTwitch\n.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nSometimes these runs may be executed in an unusual or specific way, such as fully completing every level, completing a game blindfolded,\n[\n8\n]\nor featuring multiple runners racing against one another to complete a game first.\n[\n9\n]\nVideo games run in Games Done Quick events include both\nretro\nand modern titles. The runs typically feature commentary from the runner(s) or experienced commentators, as well as donation messages read by an announcer.\nMost of the popular runs feature video game glitches\n[\n10\n]\nand discussion between the runner and the commentators, most frequently describing techniques or using observational humor and banter.\n[\n11\n]\nHumor and banter is especially used for non-interactive or repetitive sequences that don't require the runner to use much or any skill. Donations from viewers may feature humorous comments that contain inside jokes among the speedrunning community, as well as more personal acknowledgments concerning the charity donated to. Because of the live broadcast and wider audience, runners and commentators are encouraged to refrain from using strong profanity and offensive behavior.\n[\n12\n]\nWhen donating, donors have the option to put their money towards a particular incentive. These incentives can be in the form of bonus speedruns, showcases of additional tricks or glitches, or an in-game decision such as naming the player character.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nGames Done Quick's former logo, used until 2018\nWriter and speedrunner Eric Koziel identifies two important precursors to Games Done Quick: the \"Desert Bus for Hope\" donation drive organized by\nLoadingReadyRun\nin November 2007, and a series of charity speedrun marathons held by\nTheSpeedGamers\nstarting in March 2008.\n[\n13",

He has a achieved a total of 17 rank 1 titles throughout his WoW career\n[1]\n.\nBiography\n[\nedit\n]\nMohammed \"Ziqo\" Beshir has been an active player of Blizzard games since his childhood. He discovered a love for not only playing, but also excelling at video games through Diablo 2. He later turned to World of Warcraft, where he played a Rogue in the burning crusade expansion and once again excelled, specifically in the arena. A friend of Ziqo's later advised Ziqo to switch from playing a Rogue to instead playing a Mage, which he did. Mage has since become Ziqo's signature class in World of Warcraft.\nZiqo started livestreaming his arena success on Xfire (a popular livestreaming program before twitch.tv was an alternative) in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, and was at the time one of the most popular WoW arena livestreamers. He was known for his large afro, witty and funny communication with arena teammates, raps\n[2]\n, and streaming from the Red Light District in Amsterdam, where he lived at the time (he has since moved back to Sweden). He later switched to streaming on Twitch.tv, and has found professional success there ever since. On top of streaming WoW arena gameplay, he has dabbled in gathering unobtainable gear sets on the Black Market Auction house in WoW\n[3]\n, streamed and played a mage on the WoW Classic version, briefly streamed League of Legends where he achieved the rank of Diamond, and has even streamed some Counter Strike: Global Offensive\n[4]\n.\nZiqo started his casting career as an analyst, and was an analyst on the blizzcon stage, before advancing to becoming a caster on the blizzcon stage. He has since casted many different WoW PvP tournaments and competitions both official, sponsored by Blizzard, and unofficial, community-organized events.\nZiqo is ethnically from Egypt but was born and raised in Sweden where he currently lives. He speaks Swedish, English and Arabic fluently.\nZiqo was a part of the Method organization as a content creator from mid 2017\n[5]\nuntil june in 2020\n[6]\n, where he left with many others due to a sexual abuse scandal within the core of the Method organization. He has since joined Cloud 9 as a Streamer & Content Creator\n[7]\n.\nZiqo is currently a full time streamer on Twitch\n[8]\nwhere he still plays and livestreams World of Warcraft actively.

It also offers music broadcasts, creative content, and \"in\nreal life\n\" streams. Twitch is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of\nAmazon\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIt was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform\nJustin.tv\n.\n[\n6\n]\nContent on the site can be viewed either live or via\nvideo on demand\n.

Originally formed in the 1990s by\nErick Sermon\nand\nParrish Smith\nof the rap group\nEPMD\n, the group included rap artists such as\nK-Solo\n,\nRedman\n,\nDas EFX\n,\nTop Quality\n, and\nKnucklehedz\n. When EPMD broke up for the first time in 1993, the collective separated, with Sermon forming\nDef Squad\nand Smith retaining the Hit Squad name.\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the success of their debut album\nStrictly Business\n, EPMD sought to\nmentor\nnew artists. The first artist to make a guest appearance on an EPMD album was\nK-Solo\n. Solo was featured on their second album\nUnfinished Business\non the song \"Knick Knack Patty Wack\". The first mention of \"Hit Squad\" appeared on EPMD's third album\nBusiness as Usual\non the track \"Hit Squad Heist\". The lyrics mention Redman, K-Solo and Tom J of Knucklehedz.\n[\n1\n]\nRedman is also featured on two tracks of that album.\nIn 1993, EPMD released the single \"Headbanger\" from their fourth album\nBusiness Never Personal\n. The single featured K-Solo and Redman and the\nmusic video\nfeatures appearances by most of the Hit Squad.\n[\n2\n]\nThe single reached #11 on\nBillboard\n'\ns\nHot Rap Tracks\nchart.\n[\n3\n]\nThe single's success made \"Headbanger\" the Squad's \"\nsignature song\n\".\n[\n4\n]\nThe album also features\nDas EFX\non the track \"Cummin' At Cha\".\nBreakup\n[\nedit\n]\nIn late 1992, tensions grew within the Hit Squad. According to an article in\nThe Source\n, squad members alleged financial impropriety by Smith, who owned their management company. Smith's home was invaded by armed intruders believed to have been hired by squad members. While Smith declined to publicly give details on who was behind the invasion, Sermon was arrested and briefly detained for questioning, but no charges were filed.\n[\n2\n]\nEPMD officially broke up in January 1993. Redman and Hurricane G continued to collaborate with Sermon, while Das EFX and DJ Scratch remained under Smith's management. K-Solo pursued separate endeavors.\n[\n2\n]\nThe debut album by Knucklehedz became lost in the shuffle in the midst of the breakup and was shelved.\n[\n5\n]\nThe original Hit Squad splintered into two different groups. Sermon formed\nDef Squad\nwith Redman,\nJamal aka Mally G\nand another\nprotégé\nKeith Murray\nwhile PMD retained the Hit Squad name with K-Solo, Das EFX, DJ Scratch and\nTop Quality\n.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nIn this new incarnation, the PMD led Hit Squad would appear on PMD's solo albums and on the Das EFX albums\nHold It Down\nand\nGeneration EFX\n. Hit Squad would also appear on the single and video for the song \"Beef\" from\nChubb Rock\n's 1997 album\nThe Mind\n. On the album\nThe Mix Tape, Vol. II\nby Funkmaster Flex, a freestyle by PMD, Nocturnal & Das EFX was featured on the album. Smith appeared alongside rap unknowns Blast, Poogi and L The Pro on the classic 1997\nTony Touch\nmixtape\nPower Cypha 2\n, credited as \"PMD & The Hit Squad\".\nOn EPMD's 1997 reunion album\nBack in Business\n, Smith's Hit Squad and Sermon's Def Squad came together and were billed as The Squadron.\n[\n8\n]\nBoth groups are featured in the video for the single \"\nDa Joint\n\".\nIn 2004, Smith released an album titled\nHit Squad: Zero Tolerance\nusing previously unreleased verses by the original members combined with his latest new artists.\nAs of the 2006 EPMD reunion, most of the former Hit Squad members also reunited, along with Def Squad rapper Keith Murray.\n[\n4\n]\nA new album for the Hit Squad/Def Squad is planned.\nAnother reunion was staged in 2012.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nOn PMD's 2013 EP release\nNew Business\n, he introduced a group under the Hit Squad umbrella called Team Takeover made up of rappers Nymrod, Comatose, Nam Nitty, and Michael Nixx. The group is featured in the music video for the track \"Symphony 2013\".\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n",

He was the first person to ever \"no-hit\" a\nDark Souls\ngame\n[\n4\n]\n. His initial \"no-hit\" run of\nDark Souls\nwas met with disbelief by the series' creator Hidetaka Miyazaki\n[\n5\n]\ndue to the difficulty of that franchise\n[\n6\n]\n. He inflicts considerable punishments upon himself for failing self-assigned \"no-hit\" challenges\n[\n7\n]\n. His most well-known \"no-hit\" runs to date are the\nDark Souls\ntrilogy run\n[\n8\n]\n, the \"God Run\" which was comprised of the\nDark Souls\ntrilogy,\nBloodborne\n, and\nDemon's Souls\n[\n9\n]\n, the \"God Run 2\" which appended\nSekiro\nto the original \"God Run,\" and the \"God Run 3\" which added\nElden Ring\nto the \"God Run 2.\"\n[\n10\n]\nThe \"God Run 2\" took him two years and seven months\n[\n11\n]\nto complete, whereas the \"God Run 3\" only took him two months to complete\n[\n12\n]\n.\nLucifer explaining how close he was to beating God.\nOrnstein resets the run.\nMajora kinda sus.\nHis real name is Aiden Jelobi Mason\n[\n13\n]\n. He stands 5'4\" and eats a diet exclusively of pot noodles and\nFerrero Rocher\n. His favorite book is\nThe Mind Illuminated\n, his favorite film is\nGood Will Hunting\n, and his favorite person is \"the love of my life and my babe, Megantron\". Despite having a favorite book, he is semi-illiterate due to spurious homeschooling. He frequently excuses his deficiencies by citing that his father smoked a lot of herb when he was a child. He elicits subscriptions from unsuspecting viewers by threatening his beloved pooch Linkypoo. He furthermore constantly lies and makes excuses for why he is unable to stream on a particular day. If breaking keyboards and controllers in soy-fueled fits of rage is ever rendered a punishable crime, he will have to serve multiple life sentences. He has so far been banned not just once\n[\n14\n]\n, but twice\n[\n15\n]\nfrom his preferred streaming platform for terms-of-service-violating sexual content.\nThe average Hob stream experience.\nA dual syllogism and heuristic for navigating the endless gaslighting of the stream without being driven mad as a consequence.\nAs of November 2024, The_Happy_Hob's Twitch subscription count has dropped to 2016 levels. Hob is currently looking for an entry level job at Tesco (or equivalent) and, in the meantime, is happy to provide reasonably priced \"happy endings\" under the Manchester Trinity Bridge, making good use of his soft gamer hands. However, due to his long-running issues with RSI, this current endeavor is not expected to last very long.\n↑\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/the_happy_hob\n↑\nhttps://www.destructoid.com/streamer-beats-the-whole-souls-series-and-bloodborne-without-taking-a-hit/\n↑\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/7xn34x/watch-a-streamers-emotional-reaction-to-beating-all-soulsborne-games-without-getting-hit\n↑\nhttps://mashable.com/2018/03/10/dark-souls-trilogy-no-hit/\n↑\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2016/3/29/11324820/dark-souls-no-hit-run-miyazaki-interview\n↑\nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/04/dark-souls-iii-review/\n↑\nhttps://gamerant.com/twitch-streamer-happy-hob-shaves-head/\n↑\nhttps://kotaku.com/dark-souls-expert-beats-entire-series-without-getting-h-1823662283\n↑\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2019/3/21/18275978/dark-souls-bloodborne-perfect-run-happy-hob\n↑\nhttps://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-what-the-god-run-3-twitch-streamer-the-happy-hob-garners-attention-defeating-soulsborne-games-without-getting-hit\n↑\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/qf2n72/after_2_years_and_7_months_of_attempts_the_happy/\n↑\nhttps://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-what-the-god-run-3-twitch-streamer-the-happy-hob-garners-attention-defeating-soulsborne-games-without-getting-hit\n↑\nhttps://twitchbeat.com/the-happy-hob-banned/\n↑\nhttps://win.gg/news/the-happy-hob-suspended-from-twitch-after-sexually-charged-joke/\n↑\nhttps://x.com/The_Happy_Hob/status/1875263555039326387\nCommunity content is available under\nCC BY-NC-SA\nunless otherwise noted.\nAdvertisement\nExplore properties\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFollow Us\nOverview\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCommunity\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nAdvertise\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFan",

It holds the\nGuinness World Record\nfor having \"the most users to input a command to play a live streamed videogame\" with 1,165,140 participants.\n[\n1\n]\nThe concept was developed by an anonymous Australian programmer and launched on 12 February 2014, starting with the game\nPokémon Red\n. The stream became unexpectedly popular, reaching an average concurrent viewership of over 80,000 viewers (with at least 10% participating). On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment.\n[\n2\n]\nOn 5 December 2014, Twitch Plays\nPokémon\nreceived a\nGame Award\nin the \"Best Fan Creation\" category.\n[\n3\n]\nThe experiment was met with attention by media outlets and staff members of Twitch for its interactivity, its erratic and chaotic nature, the unique challenges faced by players due to the mechanics of its system, and the community and\nmemes\ndeveloped by participants. Twitch as a company used the experiment to explore how they could make streaming more interactive for viewers and expand their offerings. Following the completion of\nRed\n, the broadcaster continued the channel with many other games in the\nPokémon\nseries along with unofficial\nROM hacks\n. The broadcaster has plans to continue with other\nPokémon\ngames as long as there remains interest in the channel. The success of the experiment led to a number of similar Twitch-based streams for other games, and led Twitch to promote more streams with similar interactivity with watchers.\nPremise\n[\nedit\n]\nInspired by another Twitch-based interactive game,\nSalty Bet\n(a website where users can wager on the outcome of randomized\nM.U.G.E.N.\nmatches),\n[\n4\n]\nand described as a\nsocial experiment\n, the system used by the stream was coded by an anonymous Australian programmer, colloquially known as the \"Streamer\", consisting of an\nIRC bot\nwritten in\nPython\nand the\nGame Boy\nemulator\nVisualBoyAdvance\n. The script captures specific case-insensitive messages (directional commands, \"B\", \"A\", \"select\", and \"start\") sent into the stream's chat room by users, and sends them to the emulator as button input, thus controlling the game. An additional web app coded using\nJavaScript\nis used to display a live tally of moves that are shown within the stream. The Streamer chose\nPokémon Red\nand\nBlue\nfor the project, citing nostalgia for the early games,\n[\n5\n]\nthe fact that \"Even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress in\nPokémon\n\",\n[\n6\n]\nand because its current control structure \"[wouldn't] work with any genre that isn't a\nJRPG\n\", particularly targeting its \"forgiving\" turn-based structure and lack of reaction-based gameplay, compensating for the large amount of\ninput lag\nbetween the game and the stream. The Streamer used an\nedited\nversion of the game, which claims to make all the original 151 Pokémon accessible, in hopes of making completion of the Pokédex a possibility. However, the edited version used was unfinished and has no gameplay differences when compared to the original game.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe erratic nature of the control scheme has made the game longer and harder to play than under normal circumstances;  an\nArs Technica\nwriter commen",

The game was released on 16 February 2013. When\nOld School RuneScape\nlaunched, it began as an August 2007 version of the game\nRuneScape\n, which was highly popular prior to the launch of\nRuneScape 3\n. The game has since received engine improvements, new content, and\nquality of life\nupdates largely decided by the community via in-game polls. Despite originally having a smaller development team and a slower update schedule relative to\nRuneScape\n,\nOld School RuneScape\nis now the more popular version of the game, with an all-time record of 231,719 concurrent players in December 2024. A mobile version for\nAndroid\nand\niOS\nwas released in October 2018.\n[\n1\n]\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nRuneScape § Gameplay\nIn-game screenshot, showing a player in combat with a goblin\nOld School RuneScape\nis an\nMMORPG\nwith\nadventure\nelements. It features a\npersistent world\nin which players can interact with each other and the environment. The basic mechanics are largely the same as\nRuneScape\non 10 August 2007. The player controls a single (human) character and can interact with\nNPCs\n, objects, and entities in the game world by left-clicking or right-clicking and selecting an option from the object's right-click context menu. Users can gain\nexperience points\n(XP) and level up individual skills, making their playable character more powerful in various ways.\n[\n2\n]\nThere is a large selection of skills, grouped mainly between three different categories: combat, gathering, and artisan. Combat skills, which are Attack, Strength, Defence, Ranged, Magic, Prayer, and Hitpoints, allow the player to defeat enemy monsters or other players in certain circumstances. The gathering skills, which include Mining, Fishing, and Woodcutting, allow the player to gather in game resources to use or sell. The artisan skills include skills such as Cooking, Crafting, Fletching and Smithing. The input mechanics are primarily\npoint-and-click\n. The game runs on a\ntick-based\nsystem where the game state refreshes every 600 milliseconds.\n[\n3\n]\nPost-release features\n[\nedit\n]\nFeatures that were not released ",

She became known for her laidback personality and offbeat trolling of her friends. Nowadays, Miyoung can usually be seen playing\nValorant\nor an assortment of variety games.\nMiyoung is roommates with\nFuslie\n,\nValkyrae\n,\nYvonnie\n,\nSykkuno\n, and new member\nTinaKitten\nhence they are called the \"\nRoomies\n\" group.\nContents\n1\nBackground\n2\nEarly appearances\n3\nCareer\n3.1\nFTB Revelations MC SMP\n3.1.1\nS1\n3.1.2\nS2\n3.2\nLAMPS House\n3.3\nBloons TD 6\n3.4\nMusic\n3.5\nOTV SMP\n4\nPersonal Life\n5\nTrivia\n6\nQuotes\n7\nGallery\n8\nReferences & Footnotes\nBackground\n[\n]\nBefore streaming, Miyoung used to work as finance for a medical center. In her subathon, Miyoung revealed how she would always feel bad handing out patients' bills as healthcare in the US (more specifically, LA) is globally notorious for being costly. Miyoung concluded her flashback by expressing her yearn for the country to eventually adopt free healthcare.\nEarly appearances\n[\n]\nMiyoung’s friend AriaSaki Introduced her to the streaming world. Although she didn't have the confidence to start streaming, she met OfflineTV and other streamers. In 2018 Miyoung together with Aria appeared on the Lily’s IRL stream.\nOn December 9, 2019, on\nLily\n's stream\n\"Decorating Room with Michael Reeves and AriaSaki\"\n, Miyoung makes an appearance. She was helping with redecorating, but most of the time she was off camera. At one point, she stands in front of the camera and people in chat start asking who she was and Lily says Miyoung and Aria says to call her Mingying.\n[\n3\n]\nOn December 18, 2019,\nAria\ndid a cooking stream together with Miyoung.\n[\n4\n]\nMiyoung played League of Legends with Aria and OfflineTV on stream and off stream. According to Aria, she was too shy to talk on stream.\n[\n5\n]\nOn February 5, 2020,\nAria\ndid a cooking stream together with Miyoung and\nTina\n.\n[\n6\n]\nCareer\n[\n]\nMiyoung's streaming career started because of both\nAriaSaki\nand\nDisguised Toast\n. Toast gave his laptop\n[\n7\n]\nto Miyoung and taught her the basics, and Aria emotionally supported her.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nOn May 7 2020, Miyoung creates her Twitch account. She didn't want her family finding out that she started streaming, so she created her Twitch name \"Kkatamina\" by combining her League name \"\nKata\nna\" and her other alias \"\nMina\n\". For the first few days of streaming, Miyoung refused to tell her Twitch name to Aria.\n[\n10\n]\nIn the beginning Miyoung mostly streamed League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. On June 8 2020, Miyoung makes her first guest appearance on Toast'",

At\nDreamHack\nAtlanta 2022, Ludwig raised $315,000 during his 50-hour-long glass box stream, with 50% of that being donated to Alveus.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nFellow streamers Britt and Malena held a fundraising live stream for Alveus in November 2022 and raised over $20,000 for the sanctuary, during a period of time where Higa had stepped away from streaming.\n[\n13\n]\nIn April 2023, the new CEO of Twitch,\nDan Clancy\n, visited Alveus to meet the staff and ambassadors.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nClancy also donated his first month of earnings from his personal Twitch stream to Alveus.\n[\n16\n]\nIn September 2024, during the opening ceremony of the semi-annual\nTwitchCon\nevent, Twitch announced a donation of $100,000 to Alveus Sanctuary.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nConservation and education efforts\n[\nedit\n]\nAlveus takes in animals for a variety of reasons, some of them being non-releasable due to injuries or confiscations from the pet trade, and so on, with 32 animals at the sanctuary currently. These animals act as ambassadors for their species, all with different stories and conservation missions.\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nThese animal ambassadors are used in Alveus' educational content to allow viewers to build a connection to the specific animal and then learn to care for the species as a whole. \"I learned that model of people falling in love with an individual animal and then caring about their species and planet,\" Higa told\nKXAN\n. \"If they knew, they would care, because they love these animals, and so my job is to be that bridge and teach people.\"\n[\n21\n]\nStompy, an\nemu\n, was the first ambassador at Alveus and helps educate viewers on the\nexotic meat trade\n,\ntraditional medicine\n, and overexploitation of animal products in cosmetics. Higa hand-raised Stompy on many of her live streams as Alveus was initially built.\n[\n22\n]\nOther ambassadors at the sanctuary include\nmacaws\n,\nAmerican red foxes\n, a\ncarpet python\n,\ndonkeys\n,\nchinchillas\n,\nmarmosets\n, and more.\n[\n20\n]\nAlveus collaboration stream w",

Soon an Amish family in the hills of Ohio found him and raised him as their own. When Vincent was young, he would mow lawns and garden in order to get money to help fund his passions. When he was fourteen, he left home to explore the world outside of the Amish doctrine in Hawaii for some reason. While in Hawaii, Vincent discovered his love for acting, filmmaking, and internet culture. In 2006, Vincent uploaded his first YouTube video. Vincent graduated from the University of Honolulu in 2009, and decided to move to Los Angeles in order to achieve his dream of becoming an actor. While in Los Angeles, Vincent became a model and actor for various companies and projects. Vincent ultimately decided that he wanted to return to his passion for filmaking and wanted to make YouTube his career, even though his family was wary about this decision. Vincent began this content creation in 2012, when he went live on Twitch under the name of \"Cyr.\" Cyr's early streams consisted of various RPG gameplay. In 2017, Cyr finally found success on YouTube, and was able to begin streaming and creating content full time. In July, 2020, Cyr moved to mother russia.\nOn October 11th, 2021, Cyr announced that he would be joining\nOne True King (OTK)\nas a content creator. The announcement was made during OTK's 1-Year Anniversary Stream, where a magician revealed Cyr's face on a card which signled the announcement. This did not come as a surprise to many, as Cyr had been closely connected with fellow creators\nMizkif\n,\nEsfand\n, and\nNmplol\nnot long before the announcement was made. Cyr marked the first creator signed by OTK soley for their content and personality. Cyr is one of the few OTK members not to live with either Mizkif or Esfand.\nCyr currently has 609K followers on Twitch.\nCommunity content is available under\nCC-BY-SA\nunless otherwise noted.\nAdvertisement\nExplore properties\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFollow Us\nOverview\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCommunity\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nAdvertise\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFandom Apps\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nOTK (One True King) Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community.\nView Mobile Site\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab",

Her speech and personality are powered by an\nartificial intelligence\n(AI) system which utilizes a\nlarge language model\n, allowing her to communicate with viewers in the stream's chat. She was created by a computer programmer and AI developer named Vedal, who had the idea of an AI VTuber by combining a\nlarge language model\nwith a computer-animated\navatar\n. Her avatars; or models, are designed by the VTuber “annytf”.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nShe debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022. As of January 2025, Neuro-sama is the 7th\nmost-subscribed channel on Twitch\nof all time.\n[\n5\n]\nDevelopment\n[\nedit\n]\nNeuro-sama was created by a developer named Vedal, with the username \"vedal987\".\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nHer responses are generated by a\nlarge language model\n, which are converted into a high-pitched, childlike voice using a\ntext-to-speech application\n. According to Vedal, a separate AI model controls her in-game actions when she plays video games.\n[\n8\n]\nIn a 2023 interview with\nBloomberg News\n, he said that Neuro-sama was his full-time job.\n[\n9\n]\nThe first iteration of Neuro-sama was created in May 2019 as a neural network trained to play the rhythm game\nosu!\n.\n[\n10\n]\nThree years later, Neuro-sama would re-debut on\nTwitch\n, after a long hiatus, on 19 December 2022, now a\nchatbot\nwith a\nLive2D\nmodel.\n[\n11\n]\nShe received a new model on 27 May 2023.\n[\n12\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n2022\n[\nedit\n]\nNeuro streamed every day after her debut. She grew rapidly in popularity, from a maximum concurrent viewership of 516 on 19 December to 3,393 on 31 December, and going from a Twitch follower count of 2,825 to around 40,000 in the same time period. Nearly all of her streaming content in 2022 was of the rhythm game\nosu!\n, with one Minecraft stream. On 28 December, she defeated\nosu!\nchampion mrekk 10–5 in a 1v1 contest.\n[\n13\n]\n2023\n[\nedit\n]\nOn 3 January, Neuro-sama reached 50,000 Twitch followers. The next day, on 4 January, Neuro-sama sang for the first time on stream, performing \"\nBlinding Lights\n\" by\nThe Weeknd\n.\n[\n14\n]\nOn 11 January, the Twitch channel received a temporary ban for unspecified \"hateful conduct\", likely stemming from controversial statements made by the AI, including\nskepticism surrounding the validity of the Holocaust\nduring a stream.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nVedal added more words to her chat filter to prevent Neuro-sama from making offensive statements after this occurred.\n[\n18\n]\nThe channel was unbanned on 25 January 2023 and surpassed 100,000 followers the same day.\n[\n19\n]\nOn 25 January, Neuro-sama returned to Twitch with a stream in which she played\nPokémon\nShowdown! Gen 4 random battles against viewers.\nOn 20 February, Neuro-sama reached 200,000 Twitch followers. It was announced during a stream with\nVTuber\nOnigiri. Neuro-sama responded: \"Yeah. That's amazing. I'm happy I have that many people following me. I hope I keep them entertained with my streams and content for as long as possible,",

It seems to me, at least before they hid the names of admin/reviewers/etc, that every single person on that Discord with any kind of power/responsibility is just a streamer homie in Trey24k's circle of friends.\nAfter seeing that I began walking back my support of his anti-cheat Discord, but then something magical happened - The Video was released, and for me, it became crystal clear what kind of person Trey24k actually is. He is all about building his Twitch channel and making money. He doesn't actually care about the community and is completely disconnected from the majority of the player base. He wants to be in power. He wants to be in the spotlight. If you politely disagree with him, rather than having an open discussion he will just block you, remove Tweets that are getting heat from the community, and do whatever he can to silence opposing points of view that are clearly more popular than his.\nThe point I am trying to make? I don't believe that Trey24k can be trusted to make rational decisions that will benefit the community as a whole and I do not think he should have any type of \"BSG-sponsored\" authority.\nWith regards to the reviewers/admin in his Discord - Maybe things have changed since the user list was hidden and a bunch of normies like us have been invited to help review clips as well, but without some transparency, we will never know.\nRead more\nArchived post.

This formation spins off FaZe Holdings into an\nesports\ncompany, and an\ninternet media\ncompany.\n[\n6\n]\nHistory\nFaZe Sniping made its debut on\nYouTube\non May 30, 2010.\n[\n7\n]\nOriginally, the group were a\nCall of Duty\nclan founded by three players, Eric \"CLipZ\" Rivera, Jeff \"House Cat\" Emann (now known as \"Timid\") and Ben \"Resistance\" Christensen.\n[\n8\n]\nThe trio garnered a reputation for innovating trickshotting in the game\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\n.\n[\n9\n]\nTheir YouTube content took off when Ted \"Fakie\" joined the clan. It was then when FaZe unveiled the most popular series on their channel,\nILLCAMS\n.\n[\n10\n]\nFaZe Clan's focus on trickshotting and a personality-driven approach to social media led to FaZe Clan becoming one of the first popular YouTube video game channels, compared to other\nCall of Duty\nchannels which often focused solely on winning tournaments.\n[\n7\n]\nIn 2012, the channel had one million subscribers, and the clan began to branch out into\nesports\ncompetitions.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n7\n]\nTeams under the FaZe name began competing in competitions such as the\nCall of Duty Championship\nand\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships\n, who were separate from the clan's YouTube content creators, splitting members of FaZe Clan into two mostly autonomous camps.\n[\n11\n]\nOriginally, FaZe Clan did not have a corporate structure, however the original CEO was Thomas \"Temperrr\" Oliveira, who had been a member of FaZe since he was 16 years old.\n[\n11\n]\nOliveira and COO Richard “Banks” Bengtson created the first FaZe shared home in 2014 in\nPlainview, New York\n, intended to facilitate lifestyle content alongside their gaming content.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 2015, former social media platform Hubrick, run by Norwegian entrepreneur Sebastian Geurts, invested in FaZe Clan.\n[\n11\n]\nHubrick recruited former record executive Lee Trink to act as an advisor.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\nIn January 2016, FaZe ",

The restrictions were later removed, and the developers have since announced that they would work with US company Skystone Games to bring publishing duties in-house.\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nPlayers each have a deck of 12 cards. Each card depicts a Marvel character with cost, power level, and generally a special ability. At the start of each round, both players concurrently, are able put one or more card face down on one of three locations. Locations are randomly assigned for each match, and revealed one by one in the first three turns with each location having a unique effect.\n[\n5\n]\nAt the end of each round cards are revealed and special abilities of cards trigger. Whoever has the highest power at a given location wins that location. The goal of the game is to win two out of the three locations. The game usually lasts six rounds, each of them giving an increasing \"energy\" to play more powerful turn of cards.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nPlayers climb the game's ranked ladder by earning \"cubes\". A game begins with a single cube as its stakes, but a player may double the stakes at any time by \"snapping\", at which point their opponent has the option of retreating or acceding to the snap.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nAdditionally, the stakes double at the start of the final turn. Designer Kent-Erik Hagman, and chief development officer\nBen Brode\ncompared the mechanic to the\ndoubling cube\nof the traditional boardgame\nBackgammon\n.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe actual gameplay of\nMarvel Snap\nis considered relatively simple compared to other collectible card games, and individual games typically last a few minutes.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nHowever, the doubling stakes adds extra gameplay depth through\nbetting\nand\nbluffing\n, while the random reveal locations forces on-the-fly adaptation to a player’s original strategy.\n[\n9\n]\nAt the time of the global release the game featured over 170 characters, with the number increasing weekly.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nProgression\n[\nedit\n]\nIn\nMarvel Snap\n, players can obtain variants of some of their favorite cards through the in-game shop or season rewards. Variants are alternate versions of a base card's artwork, and do not offer any gameplay advantages as they are purely cosmetic. As of January 2023, there are over one thousand different variants in the game.\n[\n14\n]\nPlayers can use an in-game currency to further upgrade a card’s cosmetics, which provides progression on a “collection level” reward track.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nImproving a collection level provides additional rewards, such as more cosmetics, in-game currency, and new base cards.\n[\n16\n]\nNew base cards may also be gained each month, on a rotating basis.\n[\n15\n]\nBase cards are organized into pools, with the first two pool of cards acting as the initial collection for all players. After collecting the first two pools, pool 3, 4, and 5 cards become availa",

He played sporadically throughout 2019 primarily playing\nSigma\n, but stopped competing afterward, explaining that he would always turn down offers due to a lack of confidence.\n[1]\nHe remained active in ranked and in the community, livestreaming\nOverwatch\nfor over 1,000 hours in 2020 alone, and releasing numerous montages on YouTube.\n[2]\nPGE returned to competitive play when he joined\nAmplify\nin early 2023, after\nluka\noffered him $300 to play.\n[1]\nThe roster featured multiple other rookie players and one-tricks, and they placed second-last in\nSpring Series\n. Still, they managed to qualify for\nSummer Series\n, where they placed Top 6 with a new roster built around PGE.\n[1]\nLater that year, PGE played with the PUG team \"Dope Gaming\" in the\nFlash Ops Holiday Showdown\n, where most of his teammates were ex-\nOverwatch League\nplayers. The team placed Top 6 both in Flash Ops and, under the name\nSamsara\n, in the\nBerry Blast\ntournament the month after. Importantly, these experiences helped put him on the map for\nOverwatch Champions Series\ntryouts.\nThe beginning of Champions Series sparked a large number of livestreamed tryouts for various organizations, as players scrambled to find teams before the deadline. These tryouts helped PGE's stream triple in size, to around 100 average viewers.\n[2]\nPGE eventually formed a roster with\nTOPDRAGON\n,\nmikeyy\n,\ncowman711\n,\nOPENER\n, and\ncal\n, again giving him a majority of ex-OWL teammates. However, after\nOPENER\ndecided to instead sign with\nTimeless\n, the roster dissolved, with PGE and TOPDRAGON joining\nYFP Gaming\ninstead. On this team, PGE and\nInfekted\nwere often benched, so they again reached out to cal to try and form a new team. They were then joined by\nscissors\nand\nRakattack\nto complete the starting lineup.\n[1]\nWith only hours left before the start of\nOWCS Stage 1\n,\nStudents of the Game\nwas announced. In Stage 1, the team placed Top 6, marking the fourth consecutive such placement for PGE. But, in\nStage 2\n, a Top 3 placement",

CLG then elected to play Huhi as their mid laner, prompting Pobelter to move to\nImmortals\n, which had highly successful regular seasons in 2016 but strangely failed in playoffs, losing 0–3 to TSM in the semifinals of the NA LCS Spring Split playoffs in April, and losing 2–3 to Cloud9 in the summer seminals.\n[\n6\n]\nThey finished third in the 2016 Spring NA LCS, beating\nTeam Liquid\n3–0 in the third-place decider match.\n[\n7\n]\nAfter Immortals were removed from the LCS in the 2018 season, Pobelter joined the successful\nTeam Liquid\n. In 2019, Team Liquid replaced Pobelter with Jensen, and Pobelter went to Flyquest.\n[\n8\n]\nFlyquest was reasonably successful in 2019 Spring, finishing fourth, but placed ninth in the Summer split. Flyquest announced that they had hired Tristan \"PowerOfEvil\" Schrage as their midlaner for 2020; Pobelter wrote in November 2019 that he had not been picked up by any team for a starting position in 2020.\n[\n9\n]\nUnable to find a position, Pobelter coached for\nTeam Liquid\nduring the first half of the 2020 Spring Split, but eventually returned to Counter Logic Gaming's as their midlaner.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nOn August 5, 2020, he was optioned to CLG's academy team.\n[\n12\n]\nTournament results\n[\nedit\n]\nCareer Tournament Results\nDate\nEvent\nPlacing\nTeam\nRecord\nOpponent\nAugust 3–5, 2012\n2012 MLG Summer Championship\n3rd\nTeam Curse\n1-2\nAzubu Blaze,\nTeam SoloMid\n, and Team BLACK\nMarch 15–17, 2013\n2013 MLG Winter Championship\n3rd-4th\nCurse Academy\n0-2\nVelocity eSports\nJune 29, 2013\n2013 MLG Spring Championship\n3rd-4th\nCurse Academy\n1-2\nFXOpen e-Sports\nJanuary 24–March 29, 2015\n2015 NA LCS Spring\nRegular Season\n8th\nWinterfox\n7-11\nN/A\nMay 30–July 26, 2015\n2015 NA LCS Summer\nRegular Season\n2nd\nCounter Logic Gaming\n13-5\nN/A\nAugust 23, 2015\n2015 NA LCS Summer\nPlayoffs\n1st\nCounter Logic Gaming\n3-0\nTeam SoloMid\nJanuary 16–March 20, 2016\n2016 NA LCS Spring\nRegular Season\n1st\nImmortals\n17-1\nN/A\nApril 10, 2016\n2016 NA LCS Spring\nPlayoffs\n3rd\nImmortals\n3-0\nTeam Liquid\nJune 3–July 31, 2016\n2016 NA LCS Summer\nRegular Season\n2nd\nImmortals\n16-2\nN/A\nAugust 27, 2016\n2016 NA LCS Summer\nPlayoffs\n3rd\nImmortals\n3-2\nCounter Logic Gaming\nJanuary 20–March 26, 2017\n2017 NA LCS Spring Regular Season\n7th\nImmortals\n8-10\nN/A\nJune 2–August 6, 2017\n2017 NA LCS Summer Regular Season\n2nd\nImmortals\n14-4\nN/A\nSeptember 3, 2017\n2017 NA LCS Summer Playoffs\n2nd\nImmortals\n1-3\nTeam SoloMid\nOctober 5–15, 2017\n2017 League of Legends World Championship\nGroup Stage\n9th-12th\nImmortals\n2-5\nLongzhu Gaming,\nFnatic\n, and GIGABYTE Marines\nJanuary 20–March 18, 2018\n2018 NA LCS Spring Regular Season\n4th\nTeam Liquid\n12-8\nN/A\nApril 8, 2018\n2018 NA LCS Spring\nPlayoffs\n1s",

A former professional player, he transitioned to streaming full-time on\nTwitch\nand casting for\nApex\n. Since 2021, he has been signed to\n100 Thieves\nas a content creator.\nPlaying career\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly in his pursuit to a professional gamer and streamer, NiceWigg was working as a personal trainer in New York.\n[\n5\n]\nIn April 2019, he played a game with \"Dizzy\", who NiceWigg referred to as \"the biggest\nApex\nstreamer in the world\".\n[\n5\n]\nThe exposure from Dizzy's stream helped NiceWigg earn an increased following on his own\nTwitch\naccount, and in May, he was signed to\nCounter Logic Gaming\n(CLG)'s\nApex Legends\nroster.\n[\n5\n]\nHe competed as a\ncontroller\nplayer on PC;\n[\n6\n]\nhis signing to CLG made him the first ever controller player signed to a professional\nApex\norganization.\n[\n7\n]\nWith CLG, NiceWigg competed at the NewEgg FragFest at the Luxor's HyperX Esports Arena in Las Vegas in September, as well as the\nApex Legends\nPreseason Invitational in Poland.\n[\n5\n]\nAlso in 2019, he competed in the EXP Invitational -\nApex Legends\nat X Games Minneapolis event.\n[\n8\n]\nHe also later competed in the\nApex Legends\nGlobal Series\n(ALGS).\n[\n9\n]\nNiceWigg later played with \"Socks\" and \"bowser\", with the trio forming the \"Yeet Squad\".\n[\n10\n]\nThey played in the 2020 ALGS Summer Circuit - Super Regional 1 tournament.\n[\n10\n]\nIn October 2021, NiceWigg joined \"iiTzTimmy\" and \"Apryze\" to play under the team name \"SHEEEEEEESH\".\n[\n11\n]\nThey performed well in\nApex\nNorth American regional qualifiers,\n[\n12\n]\nearning a spot in the ALGS Pro League.\n[\n13\n]\nThe team paused competing together, in result skipping a Pro League match and rendering them ineligible for play.\n[\n14\n]\nNiceWigg originally stated the team was suspended, but Chris Pipher, Senior Manager of ALGS Operations at\nElectronic Arts\n(EA), challenged NiceWigg's statement. Pipher asserted the team was disbanded, \"just like every other team that has skipped a match in the Pro League\".\n[\n14\n]\nShortly thereafter, NiceWigg issued an apology for what he called a \"false claim\", stating he should have been more knowledgeable on the ALGS rules.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the offseason between\nALGS Year 3\nand 4, NiceWigg joined iiTzTimmy and Verhulst as a member of The Dojo, an orgless team, for one North American unofficial match, called a scrimmage or \"scrims\" by\nApex\npro players.\n[\n15\n]\nNiceWigg no longer competes professionally, with media outlets describing him as a former professional player.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nStreaming and casting career\n[\nedit\n]\nIn addition to playing\nApex\n, NiceWigg also streams and casts for the game. On his streams, he has been documented voicing his opinions on new characters, as well as the meta changes made to the game.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nIn October 2019, he achieved 18,000 viewers on an\nApex\nstream that\nShroud\nhosted with him.\n[\n22\n]\nThat December, NiceWigg held a charity stream, raising over $10,000 for\nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital\n.\n[\n23\n]\nIn September 2021, NiceWigg signed to\n100 Thieves\nas a content creator.\n[\n24\n]\nAt the time of his signing, he had amassed over 400,000 followers on Twitch and nearly 100,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel.\n[\n4\n]\nIn August 2023, NiceWigg joined Jacob \"HisWattson\" McMillan's efforts to sponsor monthly\nApex\ntournaments for women.\n[\n25\n]\nAs a caste",

Formerly a professional player for\nTeam Dignitas\n, he retired from professional play in 2014 to pursue a full-time\nstreaming\ncareer on\nTwitch\n. He is one of\nLeague of Legends\n' largest\nonline personalities\nwith over 2.6 million followers on Twitch. In 2017 in an interview with\nRolling Stone\nit was revealed he earns $2 million annually from streaming.\n[\n1\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\n2011\n[\nedit\n]\nIn a\nReddit AMA\n, Santana said the origin of his name came from his mom calling him \"cute\".\n[\n2\n]\nAt a young age, he played a lot of video games, particularly\nSOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs\n. He first began playing\nLeague of Legends\nshortly after the game's creation because it was free to play. After a few months, he began competing in local tournaments, where he was noticed by other players such as William \"\nscarra\n\" Li, who recruited him in April 2011 as an AD Carry on the team Rock Solid.\n[\n1\n]\nIn September of that year,\nTeam Dignitas\nacquired the team to venture into professional\nLeague of Legends\n, and with it acquired Santana, scarra, and Joedat \"Voyboy\" Esfahani.\n[\n3\n]\nAccording to Santana, his parents were proud of his career. \"Having them support me and want me to do my best was very helpful for me to really focus on improving and doing what I had to do to be the best.\"\n[\n1\n]\nA month later, the team won 1st place at\nIGN ProLeague (IPL)\nSeason 3 in Atlantic City, defeating Epik Gamer 2–1 in the finals and earning a $10,000 prize for the team.\n[\n4\n]\n2012\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2012, the team won 1st place at the LoLPro.com Curse Invitational in San Francisco and earned a $20,000 prize for the team.\n[\n5\n]\nLater that year the team placed 2nd at the\nMLG\nSummer Championship in Raleigh, North Carolina losing to\nTeam Curse\nin the finals, but both teams were disqualified and not awarded a prize after an investigation by MLG found the teams guilty of collusion.\n[\n6\n]\nIn September, Team Dignitas placed 2nd in the Season 2 North American Regional Finals in Seattle, Washington at\nPAX Prime\n, losing to\nTeam SoloMid\nin the finals but qualifying the team to compete in the\nSeason 2 World Championship\nin Los Angeles. The team placed last during the group stage without a single win, but their participation at Worlds qualified the team to compete in the Season 3 Spring Split.\n[\n7\n]\nTSM\ntop laner\nDyrus\nlater publicly apologized for accidentally revealing Team Dignitas's secret strategy to their opponents prior to the group stage, and admitted that the strategy might have given the team the upper hand in the tournament. \"[Leaking the strategy] put Team Dignitas\non tilt\nand lowered their morale... For those who say they would have lost anyway, that's not true because [TSM] lost to [the strategy] four times...\"\n[\n8\n]\n2013\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2013, the team started off strong, going 16–5 during the Spring regular season in the first 21 games,\n[\n3\n]\nbefore going 1–6 in its final 7 games, ending the Spring regular season 17–11 but qualifying to compete in the Spring playoffs. In the Spring playoffs, the team placed last. In the 2013 Summer regular season, the team finished 5th with a score of 13–15 and qualified to compete in the Summer playoffs, but finished 4th, failing to qualify to compete in Worlds but allowing the team to compete next spring.\n[\n7\n]\nWhen asked about avoiding\nrelegation\n, Santana said \"I don't even know how that was possible. Against [Team Curse], I honestly thought",

How am I supposed to protect myself here? This is an issue way bigger than me. Content creators aren't being informed by Twitch on the proper steps to protect themselves from this happening, and there has to be a better way to handle this than suddenly striking our accounts and banning us out of nowhere.\"\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nIn June 2020, Fu participated in a\nChess.com\ntournament for Twitch streamers titled\nPogChamps\n.\n[\n15\n]\nShe made it to the quarterfinals of the consolation bracket, where she lost to fellow streamer\nxQc\n.\n[\n16\n]\nFu would later be one of over 40 streamers featured on the cover of the August 2020 edition of\nChess Life\n.\n[\n17\n]\nOn September 2, 2020, Fu announced that she signed an exclusive contract with Twitch.\n[\n18\n]\nOn March 26, 2021, Fu created the character “April Fooze” for the\nonline modded Grand Theft Auto V\nroleplay server, NoPixel.\n[\n19\n]\nAs part of her character, Fu has released a number of collaborative songs under the name April Fooze, including “If You’re Broke I’m Busy (ft. Ryan King)”\n[\n20\n]\nand “April’s Fool (ft. SocialTea and Ryan King)”\n[\n21\n]\nbetween March - April, 2022. Fooze has also been featured on a number of tracks by other NoPixel music artists, such as “SUGRBABY” by Liz Anya\n[\n22\n]\nand “SL*T4U” by the Bimbos.\n[\n23\n]\nOn May 12, 2021, Fu joined the\ngaming\norganization and\nlifestyle\nbrand\n100 Thieves\nas a content creator.\n[\n24\n]\nOn August 12, 2021, Fu starred in the music video for\nSub Urban\nand\nBella Poarch\n's song, \"\nInferno\n\".\n[\n25\n]\nShe also participated in a stream promoting the video.",

It also offers music broadcasts, creative content, and \"in\nreal life\n\" streams. Twitch is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of\nAmazon\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIt was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform\nJustin.tv\n.\n[\n6\n]\nContent on the site can be viewed either live or via\nvideo on demand\n. The games shown on Twitch's current\n[update]\nhomepage are listed according to audience preference and include genres such as real-time strategy games, fighting games, racing games, and first-person shooters.\n[\n7\n]\nThe popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of Justin.tv. In October 2013, the website had 45 million unique viewers,\n[\n8\n]\nand by February 2014, it was considered the fourth-largest source of peak\nInternet\ntraffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Twitch Interactive to represent the shift in focus when Justin.tv was getting shut down in August 2014.\n[\n9\n]\nThe same month, the service was acquired by\nAmazon\nfor\nUS$\n970 million,\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nwhich later led to the introduction of synergies with the company's subscription service\nAmazon Prime\n.\nBy 2015, Twitch had more than 100 million viewers per month.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 2017, Twitch remained the leading live-streaming video service for video games in the US, and had an advantage over\nYouTube Gaming\n, which shut down its standalone app in May 2019.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nAs of February 2020,\n[update]\nit had three million broadcasters monthly and 15 million active users daily, with 1.4 million average\nconcurrent users\n.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nAs of May 2018,\n[update]\nTwitch had over 27,000 partner channels.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n18\n]\nAs of January 2025,\n[update]\nTwitch was the\n30th-most-visited website in the world\nwith 23.46% of its traffic coming from the United States, followed by Russia with 8.87%, Germany with 7.08% and France with 6.26%.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nIn late 2023, Twitch announced that they would stop operating in South Korea in 2024 because of its\nne",

The game is a spinoff of\nLeague of Legends\nand is based on\nDota Auto Chess\n, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. The game released as a\nLeague of Legends\ngame mode for\nWindows\nand\nmacOS\nin June 2019 and as a standalone game for\nAndroid\nand\niOS\nin March 2020, featuring\ncross-platform play\nbetween them.\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nBased on\nDota Auto Chess\n, a\nmod\nfor\nDota 2\n, the game centers around eight players who construct teams to fight one another and be the last player standing.\n[\n1\n]\nThe battlefield consists of\nhexagons\n, where players can strategically place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between rounds. During each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players matched randomly for that round, or else paired against computer-controlled enemies, frequently called\nPVE\nrounds. In the rounds against computer-controlled enemies, each enemy has a chance to drop gold, units, or items that the player can use.\n[\n2\n]\nHealth lost from losing a round is calculated with a combination of set damage per round and how many units an opponent had still alive.\nThe game consists of several stages, with each stage consisting of seven rounds, with the exception of stage 1. Stage 1 consists of three rounds of computer-controlled enemies. On round four of each stage, there is a feature called the \"Carousel\", in which players have access to a free rotation of units with random equipped items to select from. During these shared rounds, the two players with the lowest health are able to choose their units first, followed by the next two players with the lowest health, and so on. If there are players with similar health points, the game will randomly choose the order.\n[\n3\n]\nOn the last round of each stage, players will face computer-controlled enemies.\nPlayers accumulate gold during rounds and can save it to build\ninterest\n, which further increases their income per round by +1 gold for every 10 gold they have.\n[\n4\n]\nInterest income is capped at +5 gold per round, with exceptions for augments that overrule the limit.\n[\n5\n]\nPlayers can also gain additional income per round with \"streak bonuses\" by either winning multiple rounds in a row or losing multiple rounds in a row.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n6\n]\nStreak bonuses increase at a threshold of 3, 5 and 6+ respectively, each tier granting +1 gold per a round.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nWith this gold, players can either reroll the five units automatically offered to them in their shop at the start of each round, purchase units from their shop or purchase\nexperience points\nto increase their level. The higher a player's level, the more units they can place on the board, scaling in tandem (a player can have 2 units on the board at level 2, 5 units on the board at level 5 and so on), the boards unit capacity can also be modified by certain items and augments acquired throughout the match.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n8\n]\nHigher player levels also increase the average rarity of units in the shop. Unit rarity is separated into category's based on cost, ranging f",

Currently returning to the United States.\nThe basic broadcasting style is to broadcast quietly and quietly. The broadcasting tension is not very high, and this tension is maintained consistently from the beginning of the broadcast to the end. Or, depending on your condition, you may become even lower. However, if necessary, at certain points, the atmosphere can be revived by raising the humorous tone. In the past, I talked very fast and broadcast or filmed, but I accepted the feedback from viewers that the pronunciation was too fast and difficult to understand, so now I am conscious of reducing the speed of pronunciation while broadcasting.\nDuring the broadcast, we mainly answer questions from global server users asking about the latest information or settings for Lost Ark from Korean server sources, provide the latest information on the Korean server, or provide content that revolves around high-ranking raids with regular Korean raid members who can speak English. I'm on the side.\nEvery Tuesday is designated as Tooki Tuesday and other games are played, and if Roa's free date period is long or major masterpieces are released, he plays like a comprehensive game streamer regardless of the day of the week.

I also know basic phrases, but for the most part, I don’t really understand vocal Korean well. Maybe like 10-20% of what’s spoken to me even gets processed, and the rest I just ignore.\nYou should have worked when you came to Korea, so you can read the basic level. I know the basic grammar, but most of them do not understand well. Probably only 10-20%can be interpreted and the rest is likely to be ignored.\nHe said that Korean is only at a basic level.\n[14]\n, Since I don't actually do it on the air, I don't particularly stop using Korean chatting, but it's hard for viewers and Saints to understand what I mean, so it's recommended to use English chatting in chat rooms as much as possible. For this reason, raids where communication is important tend to be accompanied by fixed members who can translate in real time.\n4.\nbuzzword\nMany emoticons commands use\n7TV\n's common emoticons and roga universal emoticons.\nSaintuu: Viakis Hel difficulty challenges tired and bruises and won't move in the swamp pattern\n.

It also offers music broadcasts, creative content, and \"in\nreal life\n\" streams. Twitch is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of\nAmazon\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIt was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform\nJustin.tv\n.\n[\n6\n]\nContent on the site can be viewed either live or via\nvideo on demand\n.

While working as a carpenter with his father, he lost part of his left\nindex finger\n, which did not affect his ability to later hold a\npalette\nwhile painting.\n[\n4\n]\n: 22\nMilitary career\nRoss during his Air Force years, giving a painting demonstration in\nFairbanks\n, Alaska,\nc.\nlate 1970s\nIn 1961, 18-year-old Ross enlisted in the\nUnited States Air Force\nand was put into service as a medical records technician.\n[\n4\n]\n: 15\nHe rose to the rank of\nmaster sergeant\nand served as the\nfirst sergeant\nof the clinic at\nEielson Air Force Base\nin\nAlaska\n,\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nwhere he first saw the snow and mountains that later appear as recurring themes in his paintings. He developed his quick painting technique during brief daily work breaks.  Having held military positions that required him to act tough and mean, \"the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work,\" Ross decided he would not raise his voice when he left the military.\n[\n6\n]\nCareer as a painter\nDuring his 20-year Air Force career, Ross developed an interest in painting after attending an art class at the Anchorage\nU.S.O.\nclub. He found himself frequently at odds with many of his painting instructors, who were more interested in\nabstract painting\n. Ross said, \"They'd tell you what makes a tree, but they wouldn't tell you how to paint a tree.\"\n[\n7\n]\nRoss was working as a part-time bartender when he discovered a TV show called\nThe Magic of Oil Painting\n, hosted by German painter\nBill Alexander\n.\n[\n4\n]\n: 17–18\nAlexander used a 16th-century painting style called\nalla prima\n(Italian for 'first attempt'), widely known as \"wet-on-wet\", that allowed him to create a painting within thirty minutes. Ross studied and mastered the technique, began painting and then successfully selling\nAlaskan landscapes\nthat he painted on novelty\ngold-mining pans\n.\n[\n2\n",

He is best known for his time with\nNatus Vincere\n(Na'Vi) in the 2010s, where he was a member of the team that won\nThe International 2011\n. He left Na'Vi in 2018 and formed his own\nDota 2\norganization in 2020, B8.\nEarly years\n[\nedit\n]\nDendi was born in\nLviv\n, Ukraine, on 30 December 1989. As a child, at the insistence of his mother-musician, he played the\npiano\n, and participated in\nacrobatics\nand\ndancing\n.\n[\n1\n]\nThe first computer in Dendi's house was his brother's, who did not allow him to play for a long time.\n[\n2\n]\nThe gaming world was opened to him by\nQuake\nand\nDoom\n. Dendi later began playing\nWarcraft III\nat local computer clubs. Dendi's total fascination with computer games was influenced by the death of his father from cancer.\n[\n1\n]\nDendi graduated from the\nUkrainian Academy of Printing\nin 2011.\n[\n2\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2006, Dendi started playing\nDotA\nprofessionally with WG.\n[\n3\n]\nHe was a part of the Ukrainian squad that finished third in MYM Prime Nations the same year. Only a few months later, WG made it to the grand final of one of the most prestigious tournaments that existed at the time, MYM Prime Defending.\n[\n4\n]\nWhen Kingsurf.international merged with WG the next year, he became a full-time member of Ks.int.\n[\n3\n]\nIn late 2008, he joined DTS in its early stages, only to return to Ks.int in March 2009.\n[\n5\n]\nOnly three months later he returned to DTS,\n[\n6\n]\nhelping them secure a second-place victory at ESWC 2010. At the end of the year, Dendi achieved arguably the greatest success in his\nDotA\ncareer by finishing 3rd place in the most stacked tournament at the time, WDC 2010.\n[\n7\n]\nDendi joined\nNatus Vincere\n(Na'Vi) at the end of 2010, together with ArtStyle.\n[\n8\n]\nDendi began his\nDota 2\ncareer with the Ukrainian team, Na'Vi, rapidly rising to fame after winning\nThe International 2011\n.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the following years, Na'Vi continued to win many tournaments, including runner's up at\nThe International 2012\n. At\nThe International 2013\n, Na'Vi became the only team to participate in the grand finals of the prestigious tournament three years in a row, eventually losing to Alliance 3-2 in the grand finals.\nDendi was one of three\nDota 2\nplayers featured in the 2014 documentary\nFree to Play\n, which covered his story leading up to and including his performance at\nThe International 2011\n.\nAt\nThe International 2017\n, Dendi played in two live one-on-one demonstration matches against an\nOpenAI machine-learned bot\n, losing both.\n[\n9\n]\nIn September 2018, he was taken off Na'Vi's active roster before being officially released from his contract a year later.\n[\n10\n]\nIn January 2020, Dendi announced the formation of his own organization, B8.\n[\n11\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nDanil \"Dendi\" Ishutin's history\n^\na\nb\nGrand Interview with Dendi — Dota2.ru.\n^\na\nb\n\"All Pick - Danil \"Dendi\" Ishutin\"\n.\nteamliquid.net\n.

On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment.\n[\n2\n]\nOn 5 December 2014, Twitch Plays\nPokémon\nreceived a\nGame Award\nin the \"Best Fan Creation\" category.\n[\n3\n]\nThe experiment was met with attention by media outlets and staff members of Twitch for its interactivity, its erratic and chaotic nature, the unique challenges faced by players due to the mechanics of its system, and the community and\nmemes\ndeveloped by participants. Twitch as a company used the experiment to explore how they could make streaming more interactive for viewers and expand their offerings. Following the completion of\nRed\n, the broadcaster continued the channel with many other games in the\nPokémon\nseries along with unofficial\nROM hacks\n. The broadcaster has plans to continue with other\nPokémon\ngames as long as there remains interest in the channel. The success of the experiment led to a number of similar Twitch-based streams for other games, and led Twitch to promote more streams with similar interactivity with watchers.\nPremise\n[\nedit\n]\nInspired by another Twitch-based interactive game,\nSalty Bet\n(a website where users can wager on the outcome of randomized\nM.U.G.E.N.\nmatches),\n[\n4\n]\nand described as a\nsocial experiment\n, the system used by the stream was coded by an anonymous Australian programmer, colloquially known as the \"Streamer\", consisting of an\nIRC bot\nwritten in\nPython\nand the\nGame Boy\nemulator\nVisualBoyAdvance\n. The script captures specific case-insensitive messages (directional commands, \"B\", \"A\", \"select\", and \"start\") sent into the stream's chat room by users, and sends them to the emulator as button input, thus controlling the game. An additional web app coded using\nJavaScript\nis used to display a live tally of moves that are shown within the stream. The Streamer chose\nPokémon Red\nand\nBlue\nfor the project, citing nostalgia for the early games,\n[\n5\n]\nthe fact that \"Even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress in\nPokémon\n\",\n[\n6\n]\nand because its current control structure \"[wouldn't] work with any genre that isn't a\nJRPG\n\", particularly targeting its \"forgiving\" turn-based structure and lack of reaction-based gameplay, compensating for the large amount of\ninput lag\nbetween the game and the stream. The Streamer used an\nedited\nversion of the game, which claims to make all the original 151 Pokémon accessible, in hopes of making completion of the Pokédex a possibility. However, the edited version used was unfinished and has no gameplay differences when compared to the original game.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe erratic nature of the control scheme has made the game longer and harder to play than under normal circumstances;  an\nArs Technica\nwriter commen",

You should never take those people fucking seriously\"\n- Denims, after spending an hour of her life making the same criticisms\nAfter\nJay\nreleased his video on\nHasan\nand react content, two Twitch streamers stepped up to the plate to stream their response, the first being\nAhRelevant\n, and the second being Denims, whose commentary\nMauLer\n,\nRags\n,\nFringy\n, and\nDev\ntook a look at in\nEFAP 180\n. Her stream, naturally, began with her playing the entirety of someone else's video while she left the room, with Fringy and Rags horrified that this time there was not even a chair onscreen, then continued to say nothing while she did her makeup, raising the question of why she didn't just start the stream afterwards. Thankfully, Dev was there to understand the Twitch lingo that would have been lost on the other guests. Similar to AhRelevant, Denims' streams were characterized by her talking directly into the mic, peaking the audio when she would squeal at something and even chewing her food into it. As the stream went on, her use of the word \"like\" as a filler word made Fringy become hyperaware of any time he said \"like\" himself, while Rags took issue with the unmade bed featured prominently in the background.\nDenims defended using other people's videos as filler on the grounds that streamers are incentivized to never leave their stream and give a constant flow of content, and rebuffed the idea that they just play videos while they say nothing by explaining that they actually only do that sometimes. Dev was reminded of the times when he himself would watch react streamers, explaining that it was during a time when he was sad and lonely and just wanted the vicarious happiness from watching someone else chuckle at anime, and he stopped watching those streams when he stopped being sad. Denims' response to the accusation that this was stealing someone else' art was nothing more than, \"Okay dude.\" Denims decried those who have \"a certain idea of what should be or what ought to be,\" a statement that describes literally everybody, and put forth that it is the platform that should dictate what type of content is allowed, not anyone else. MauLer argued that nobody is dictating, just stating their own views on what they think is right, and Rags added that Denims would likely change her opinion on that if the platform deemed content she liked as being disallowed. Denims then wondered aloud if there even were any streamers who just watch things without commenting, apparently forgetting that she is one of those streamers. She advised anyone who took issue with such a thing",

The Stokes Twins are the 9th largest\nYouTube\nchannel as of February 4, 2025. They began making videos separately and then combined their following into a shared twins account.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nLegal controversies\n[\nedit\n]\nIn August 2020, the Stokes Twins were charged with false imprisonment effected by violence, menace, fraud or deceit and falsely reporting an emergency in connection, or\nswatting\nwith a YouTube video they recorded in October 2019.\n[\n4\n]\nThe video contained two separate fake\nbank robberies\nas pranks, where the brothers pretended to be robbers; dressed all in black, wearing ski masks and carrying duffle bags,\n[\n5\n]\nand are attempting to make a getaway by asking unsuspecting people for clothing items or transportation help.\n[\n6\n]\nIn one instance, they had called an\nUber\ndriver, who was unaware of the prank, and after the driver refused to drive them they attempted to coerce him. Numerous bystanders called police in both prank attempts and footage of the pair being stopped by officers were added to the video.\n[\n6\n]\nThe Uber driver was held at gunpoint by responding officers until it was determined the driver was not involved, and the brothers were warned but not arrested and continued to film the video with a second prank four hours later at\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n.\n[\n5\n]\nThe twins' attorneys have raised claims that the twins are not guilty of the charges as responding officers from the first prank reportedly gave suggestions for the video being filmed, and one brother reportedly called the\nIrvine Police Department\n's non-emergency line twice to tell them about the prank prior to the video being filmed. Their attorneys also raised concerns about the length of time between the video and the charges; ten months, and that the twins were not notified about the charges until after the department issued a press release about them.\n[\n7\n]\nOn April 1, 2021, the twins pleaded guilty in a plea bargain, and were sentenced to 160 hours' community service and a year of probation.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\n\"About Stokes Twins\"\n.\nYouTube\n.\n^\nWhateley, Dan (June 9, 2019).\n\"A 'twinfluencer' with millions of followers says he's leaning into TikTok for brand sponsorships and getting 'low 5-figure deals'\n\"\n.\nBusiness Insider\n.

MMORPGs are distinguished from\nsingle-player\nor small\nmulti-player\nonline RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's\npersistent world\n(usually hosted by the game's\npublisher\n), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is\noffline\nand away from the game.\nMMORPGs are played throughout the world. Global revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005,\n[\n1\n]\nand the\nwestern world\n's revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006.\n[\n2\n]\nIn 2008, the spending on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew to $1.4 billion.\n[\n3\n]\nWorld of Warcraft\n, a popular MMORPG, had over 10 million subscribers as of November 2014.\n[\n4\n]\nWorld of Warcraft\n'\ns total revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars in 2014.\n[\n5\n]\nStar Wars: The Old Republic\n, released in 2011, became the world's \"fastest-growing subscription MMO in history\" after gaining more than 1 million players within the first three days of its launch.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nCommon features\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These include several common features:\npersistent game environment\nsome form of level progression\nsocial interaction within the game\nin-game culture\nmembership in a group\ncharacter customization.\nThemes\n[\nedit\n]\nThe majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional\nfantasy\nthemes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of\nDungeons & Dragons\n. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of\nscience fiction\n,\nsword and sorcery\n, or\ncrime fiction\n. Others draw thematic material from\nAmerican comic books\n, the\noccult\n, and other\ngenres\n. These elements are often developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving\nquests\n,\nmonsters\n, and\nloot\n.\nProgression\n[\nedit\n]\nIn nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the\nplayer's character\nis the primary goal.

Early in the game's history, Larned established himself as one of the most popular Overwatch streamers on\nTwitch\n. As an\nesports\ncompetitor, Larned represented\nLuminosity Gaming\nand then\nNRG Esports\n, before leaving the active roster of the latter to resume streaming full-time. He returned to competitive play with\nTeam EnVyUs\nshortly before its roster became the\nDallas Fuel\n, one of the teams in the newly launched\nOverwatch League\n. At the end of the League's inaugural season, Larned once again announced that he would be stepping away from competitive play in favor of being a full-time streamer.\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly career\n[\nedit\n]\nPrior to his transition to\nOverwatch\n, Larned was a competitive\nHalf-Life 2\nDeathmatch and\nTeam Fortress 2\nplayer. In\nTeam Fortress 2\n, Seagull was a respected player, specializing in the Soldier\ncharacter class\n, and was a member of the tournament competition team Classic Mixup.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nLarned was invited to\nOverwatch\n'\ns\npublic beta\n, and during the beta he began streaming the game – playing the game for, and while interacting with, a live online audience – on Twitch. While his initial expectation was that he would not attract a significant number of viewers, by mid-2016 his streams were regularly attracting 30,000 concurrent viewers, making him one of the game's most popular figures.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nIn addition to streaming, Larned was a member of the team Not Enigma during the game's beta.\n[\n6\n]\nHe then went on to co-found the team Mixup, alongside fellow former-Team Fortress 2 players Yomar \"Milo\" Toledo, Carl \"Enigma\" Yangsheng, Anthony \"Harbleu\" Ballo, Brian \"Pierow\" Alesandr, and James \"Esper\" Southall. A month prior to Overwatch's official release, the Mixup roster was signed to Luminosity Gaming,\n[\n7\n]\nan organization that fields teams across several\nesports\n, using their players' popularity to attract sponsors, and paying their players salaries in return. Larned became Luminosity's star player, and by May 2016 the team had amassed a 60% win-rate over 56 tournament games, good enough to be considered the second-best North American team behind\nCloud9\n, and the fourth-best team in the world.\n[\n8\n]\nNRG\n[\nedit\n]\nOn July 24, 2016,\nShaquille O'Neal\n, a co-owner of NRG Esports, sent a tweet directed at Larned, inviting him and his team to join O'Neal's organization.\n[\n1\n]\nA week later, Luminosity announced that Larned and his teammates had declined to renew their contracts, and on August 4, 2016, NRG announced that they had signed Larned. Larned was joined on NRG by four other former ex-Luminosity players; Milo and Enigma from the original Mixer roster, as well as Daniel \"Gods\" Graeser and Mark \"Pookz\" Rendon, who joined the team later on. The sixth player, Tim \"Dummy\" Olson, played for another multi-esport organization,\nTeam Liquid\n, before joining NRG.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n5\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nThroughout 2016 NRG remained a popular team, despite lacking top results in tournament play.\n[\n3\n]\nIn October of that year they were one of four non-Korean teams to receive invitations to Season 1 of the Korean\nOGN APEX\ntournament.\n[\n11\n]\nIn the\n2016\nOverwatch\nWorld Cup\n, fans from each participating nation selected four of their team's six players through a vote, with the player receiving the most votes becoming the\ncaptain\n.

Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman\nBranimir \"Johnny\" Štulić\n. The other two members of the original line-up were Mišo Hrnjak (\nbass\n) and Boris Leiner (\ndrums\n). The band is named after a verse\n[\n2\n]\nfrom \"Der Asra\" by\nHeinrich Heine\n. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the Yugoslav new wave rock era and the\nYugoslav rock scene\nin general.\nThey released their first single in 1979 with \"Balkan\" and \"A šta da radim\". Their\neponymous debut\nwas released in 1980 and achieved commercial success, giving them commercial success in Yugoslavia. Their second album was released in 1981. Azra recorded its last studio album\nIzmeđu krajnosti\n(\nBetween the Extremes\n) in 1987. In 1988 the band recorded 4LP live album under the name\nZadovoljština\n(\nSatisfaction\n), after which Štulić broke the band up. Štulić recorded three more solo albums since moving to the\nNetherlands\n, where he lives in seclusion. A 2003\nrock\ndocumentary\n,\nSretno dijete\ndepicts Azra as the focus of the rock scene in Yugoslavia during the 1980s, along with\nBijelo dugme\n. Even today, Azra remains very popular among youth in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.\nIn 1998, music critics compiled a\nlist of 100 best albums\nof\nYugoslav pop and rock music\n. Five Azra albums were included, three of them in top 10. On the\nRadio B92\n's\nlist of 100 greatest songs of former Yugoslavia\n, four Azra songs were included, all of them in the top 20.\nBoris Leiner\n, former drummer (October 2016)\nMembers\n[\nedit\n]\nBranimir \"Johnny\" Štulić\n–\nvocals\n,\nguitar\nBranko Matun –\nbass\n(1977)\nPaolo Sfeci –\ndrums\n(1977)\nMladen Jurčić – guitar (1977–1978)\nBranko Hromatko – drums (1977–1978)\nMarino Pelajić – bass (1977–1978)\nJura Stublić\n– vocals (1978)\nBoris Leiner (ex Kanibali) – drums, vocals (from 1979)\nMišo Hrnjak – bass (1979–1982)\nJurica Pađen\n– guitars (1983–1984, from 1987)\nStephen Kipp – bass (from 1986)\n[\n1\n]\nTimeline\n[\nedit\n]\nDiscography\n[\nedit\n]\nStudio albums\n[\nedit\n]\nAzra\n(\nJugoton\n, 1980)\nSunčana strana ulice\n(Jugoton, 1981)\nFiligranski pločnici\n(Jugoton, 1982)\nKad fazani lete\n(Jugoton, 1983)\nKrivo srastanje\n(Jugoton, 1984)\nIt Ain't Like In The Movies At All\n(\nDiskoton\n, 1986)\nIzmeđu krajnosti\n(Jugoton, 1987)\nLive albums\n[\nedit\n]\nRavno do dna\n(Jugoton, 1982)\nZadovoljština\n(Jugoton, 1988)\nCompilation albums\n[\nedit\n]\nSingl ploče 1979-1982\n(Jugoton, 1982)\nKao i jučer – singl ploče 1983-1986\n(Jugoton, 1986)\nNikom nije lepše\n(Hi-Fi Centar, 1998)\nThe Ultimate Collection\n(\nCroatia Records\n, 2007)\nSingles\n[\nedit\n]\n\"Balkan\" (\nThe Balkans\n) / \"A šta da radim\" (\nAnd What Should I Do?\n) – (\nsuzy\n1979)\n\"Lijepe žene prolaze kroz grad\" (\nPretty Women Passing Through Town\n), \"Poziv na ples\" (\nAn Invitation to Dance\n) / \"Suzy F\". – (Jugoton, 1980)\n\"Đoni, budi dobar\" (\nJohnny Be Good\n) / \"Teško vrijeme\" (\nHard Time\n) – (Jugoton 1982)\n\"E, pa što\" (\nSo What\n) / \"Sloboda\" (\nFreedom\n) / \"Gluperde lutaju daleko\" (\nJerks Wander Far\n) – (Jugoton 1982)\n\"Nemir i strast\" (\nRestlessness and Passion\n) / \"Doviđenja na Vlaškom drumu\" (\nFarewell on the Valachian Road\n) – (Jugoton 1983)\nKlinček stoji pod oblokom (A Carnation Grows Under the Window ) / Flash (Jugoton 1983.) from the album \"Krivo srastanje\"\nMon ami / Duboko u tebi (My Love/Deep Insi",

Won began his career as a player in the game\nOverwatch\n. He initially competed for\nSelfless Gaming\nand later joined the\nSan Francisco Shock\nteam prior to the\nOverwatch League\n's\ninaugural season in 2018. In the 2019 season, Won's performances led to him being awarded the Most Valuable Player and won the\n2019 Overwatch League Grand Finals\n. Won also represented Team USA in the\nOverwatch World Cup\nfrom 2017 to 2019. In the\n2019 Overwatch World Cup\n, Won helped the team to claim the championship title. Due to his performance throughout the tournament, Won received the Most Valuable Player award.\nIn April 2020, Won made a transition to the emerging competitive scene of\nValorant\n, signing with the\nSentinels\n. However, he faced suspension in March 2021 following allegations of sexual abuse. Following, Won continued to stay involved in the gaming industry as a content creator.\nOverwatch\ncareer\n[\nedit\n]\nProfessional career\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter achieving rankings of second in North America and fifth in the world on\nOverwatch\n's\ncompetitive mode, Won received an opportunity to try out for\nSelfless Gaming\n, an esports team based in Georgia, United States. Although he initially did not secure a spot on the team, he was given another chance a few weeks later. Following a review of his performance by head coach and co-owner Brad Rajani, he was ultimately signed to the team.\n[\n1\n]\nHowever, Selfless Gaming disbanded on July 7, 2017, leading to the conclusion of Won's association with the team.\n[\n2\n]\nWith the inception of the\nOverwatch League\napproaching in 2018, scouts from the twelve franchises sought to sign players to complete their teams. Won attracted significant attention and sparked a bidding war between\nNRG Esports\nand\nCloud9\n. Initially inclined to join the\nLondon Spitfire\n, Cloud9's Overwatch team, Won eventually reconsidered his decision after further discussions with NRG and his parents. He opted to sign a contract worth\nUS$150,000\nper year with NRG's\nSan Francisco Shock\n, three times the league's minimum salary, forging a reunion with head coach Rajani, who became the head coach of the Shock. Due to being 17 years old at the time, Won was ineligible to participate in league matches until he reached the age of 18.\n[\n3\n]\nHe made his Overwatch League debut on March 21, 2018, against the\nFlorida Mayhem\n. Despite a loss in that match with a score of 2–3,\n[\n4\n]\nWon quickly demonstrated his skills and solidified his status as one of the league's premier damage players. As he and his teammate\nMatthew \"super\" DeLisi\nbecame eligible to compete around the same time, the team achieved an 11–9 record in the latter half of the season 3.\n[\n5\n]\nIn the\n2019 season\nof the Overwatch League, teams primarily utilized compositions consisting of three\ntanks\nand three\nsupports\nduring the first three quarters of the season. During this time, Won, who typically played as the damage hero\nTracer\n, made a transition to playing as the tank hero\nZarya\n. The San Francisco Shock, with Won's contributions, achieved impressive results, posting a perfect +28 map differential in Stage 2, reaching all three stage finals, and",

He was born and raised somewhere in northern Alabama. Boxy Fresh is a nickname acquired along time ago and the rest is history.\n[1]\nHe primarily streams\nSea of Thieves\non his off days from work.\nContents\n1\nStreaming Career\n1.1\nPlay Style\n1.2\nCombat\n1.3\nGiveaways\n1.4\nQuotes\n2\nReferences\nStreaming Career\n[\nedit\n]\nBoxy began streaming regularly around the release of the Shrouded Spoils update which released on November 28, 2018.\n[2]\nAs of February 2020 he has 5000 followers, 81,000 total views, and 10,000 hours watched.\n[3]\nHe keeps his amount of subscribers confidential.\nIn November 2019 Boxy achieved partner with Sea of Thieves.  In December 2019 he became a Twitch partner.\nIn November 2023 it was revealed on stream that BoxyFresh had made his first $1 million from streaming and content creation, giving him the highest net-worth of all Sea of Thieves creators.\nPlay Style\n[\nedit\n]\nNatural and Organic experiences. Boxy typically sails around on his sloop, solo, looking for other ships to interact with. Once he finds a worthy ship, he boards it and tries to make friends, or enemies. Some interactions include him talking in game chat in order to fool the other crews that something else is going on. By playing this way Boxy has acquired a very fun and entertaining style. If his work schedule allows it, Boxy will stream with other Sea of Thieves streamer,\nBeardageddon\n, on Friday afternoons. It has led him to some highly entertaining encounters and arena battles.\nCombat\n[\nedit\n]\nBoxy prefers to use the sword/sniper combo. \"The sword is depended upon for getting around and I have become too dependent on it. It's just how I play. It is just too natural for me\"\n[4]\nGiveaways\n[\nedit\n]\nAs of February 2020 Boxy does not give anything away to his viewers, like other Twitch streamers. There is a high demand for items like black BoxyFresh v-necks, hats, and goats. All these requests are ignored.\nQuotes\n[\nedit\n]\nBoxy has many things he says that could be considered his trade mark. These phrases are, but not limited to, \"yunerstan\", \"low key\", and \"\nRoll Tide\n\" after his favorite American college football team,\nAlabama Crimson Tide football\n.\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n↑\nhttps://www.seaofthieves.com/news/creator-spotlight-boxy-fresh\n↑\nhttps://www.seaofthieves.com/news/creator-spotlight-boxy-fresh\n↑\nhttps://twitchtracker.com/boxyfresh\n↑\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/542649786\nThis\narticle \"BoxyFresh\" is from Wikipedia\n.

After clambering around briefly she found that the culprit was a hard drive, making a strange noise. In her infinite wisdom, Lua shoved a sock into her computer to damp the sound. It worked! Problem solved. But revenge is a dish best served in small annoying dishes. And when Lua next started streaming, the computer got its revenge through a series of shocks. It should be noted, dear reader, that Lua has the memory capacity of a goldfish with amnesia. And so she had already forgotten that she had placed this sock in her computer. Which is why it took her nearly a month to think to check inside her computer after getting shocked by her computer, over and over again, and finding her sock inside her computer. So if you ever wonder where your missing socks are. They're probably inside Lua's computer.\nSpoon Phobia 🥄\n[\n]\nLuality has a long standing hatred of spoons.

With the talents of former\nMystery Science Theater 3000\n(\nMST3K\n) cast members and writers, RiffTrax also produces live shows which are broadcast to movie theaters. The style of commentating originated from MST3K, their earlier television series, in which they would similarly mock (or \"\nriff\n\") films aloud while watching them. As of September 2024, RiffTrax has riffed 554 feature films, 488 short films, and 16 TV episodes.\n[\n1\n]\nThe first releases originally featured\nMichael J. Nelson\n,\nKevin Murphy\n, and\nBill Corbett\n, through audio-only tracks intended to be played in unison with unaltered VHS and DVD copies of these programs. After the introduction of already-synced VHS and DVD material, added to the riffers were\nMary Jo Pehl\nand\nBridget Jones Nelson\n, who also wrote and performed for the\nMST3K\nseries. Guest riffers have also added commentaries, including\nparodist\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic\n, comedians\nPaul F. Tompkins\n,\nCole Stratton\nand\nJanet Varney\n, and actors\nJoel McHale\n,\nFred Willard\n, and\nNeil Patrick Harris\n, among others.\nRiffTrax products are sold in downloadable media online and delivered by app, streaming video, and DRM-free download. It is also featured on\nPluto TV\n,\nTwitch\n,\nXumo\n,\nTubi\nand a channel on\nSamsung\nTV.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds additional citations for\nverification\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this article\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\nin this section.

During this time,\nRhino Entertainment\ncollaborated to produce four riffed films on DVD:\nHollywood After Dark\n,\nKillers from Space\n,\nThe Wild Women of Wongo\n, and\nThe Giant of Marathon\n.\nAfter the association with Rhino Entertainment and\nShout Factory\n(who distributed\nThe Film Crew\nDVDs) ended, Nelson and\nLegend Films\nstarted\nRiffTrax\nin 2007 based in\nSan Diego\n. In 2012, RiffTrax was purchased from Legend by Nelson, Murphy, Corbett, and RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin.\n[\n2\n]\nThe movies chosen for\nMystery Science Theater 3000\nwere predominantly low-budget\nB-movies\nbecause the show itself was low budget and\nproducers\ncould only afford films in the public domain or otherwise cheap licenses.\n[\n3\n]\nNelson had researched bringing about directly releasing\nDVDs\nof films with the commentaries included, then realized this initial idea was not feasible since he would be \"sued out of existence.\"\n[\n4\n]\nThe best way to distribute the commentaries would be to sell them independently of the films, avoiding rights issues.\n[\n5\n]\nThere would be no legal or monetary restrictions to prevent\nRiffTrax\nfrom producing them,\n[\n6\n]\nthough viewers would have to play their own physical copies of the films at the same time.\nThe main crew of RiffTrax in 2009 (from left):\nMike Nelson\n,\nBill Corbett\n, and\nKevin Murphy\nThe company originally produced audio-only tracks which were intended to be played in unison with unaltered VHS and DVD copies of these programs. The early RiffTrax were almost all solo efforts on Nelson's part, but it soon became apparent that there was a strong demand for them. Nelson was quickly able to recruit more riffers for the project.

Sci-Fi and Fantasy movie fanatic. Lover of Cheez-Its and chocolate-covered Marshmallows. Setting off from the depths of the Caribbean (or more accurately Indiana, USA), the Captain has been sailing the seas of Twitch since June 29th, 2013. Since then, the seas have been unpredictable and chaotic, eventually leading to the acquisition of partnership on June 20th, 2014, with his sub button going live on July 7th, 2014 (the captain’s birthday). Since then, the adventure on Twitch has led Burke to new and exciting heights, and now with a regular 2k+ viewers, three MAJOR sponsors and a whole lot of emotes, the only question left is…where will the seas of Twitch take us next?\nOther\n[\n]\nSubreddit -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/BurkeBlack\nTrivia\n[\n]\nPart of the \"late shift crew\" along with Gassy Mexican, Cletus Buford, and CrReam\nReferences\n[\n]\nCategories\nCategories\n:\nSea of Thieves\nFallout 76\nAtlas Online\nPro players\nCommunity content is available under\nCC BY-NC-SA\nunless otherwise noted.\nAdvertisement\nExplore properties\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFollow Us\nOverview\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCommunity\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nAdvertise\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFandom Apps\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nStreamerpedia is a FANDOM Games Community.\nView Mobile Site\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab",

Yip grew up with his brother and sister. His parents were often on business trips in\nChina\n. Yip described his parents as \"stereotypical Asian parents\" who disapproved of video games, wanting him to take up a \"common\" career such as a lawyer or a doctor. His draw towards video games ultimately created a rift between him and his parents, with Yip recalling his mother believing he was going to be a failure. Her disdain for gaming made Yip feel that his mother had failed him and ultimately drove him out of his own home. At the age of 17, Stewie flew to LA to pursue his own interests in gaming.\n[\n4\n]\nYip stopped playing\nCounter-Strike\n1.6 for a time in favor of other games such as\nRuneScape\n,\nMapleStory\n,\nLeague of Legends\nand\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\n. He eventually picked up\nCounter-Strike\n1.6 again, but would only play surf maps and mods. Yip began playing\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive\nin the summer of 2014 after a friend gifted him a copy. He was inspired by videos of Cloud9 and would play many hours of the day. He played matchmaking for 5 months before making the switch to\nESEA\n. During this time, Yip was falsely accused of cheating by several players, further motivating him to pursue a professional CS:GO career.\n[\n5\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nSpontaneously flying to\nLos Angeles\nat the age of 17 kicked off the competitive career of a young \"Stewie2K.\" Yip had garnered attention for his competitive\nPUG\nperformances and heard rumors of a certain player's professional career soon coming to an end opening the door for Yip. He bided his time and waited for said player to relinquish his spot on the team.\n[\n4\n]\nAfter\nSean Gares\nannounced he was leaving Cloud9, the team decided to pick up Yip with Gares' personal recommendation. Yip joined Cloud9 on January 11, 2016, as an In-Game Leader. He signed the Cloud9 contract a few hours after his 18th birthday.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nHis addition was met with criticism from some veteran players.\nYip played for 2 years with Cloud9 and won several tournaments with the team including\nESL Pro League Season 4\n, DreamHack Open Denver 2017 and iBUYPOWER Masters 2017. Yip won the\nELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018\nwith Cloud9 after defeating FaZe clan in double overtime on map 3 of the grand final, the first and only major win for a North American roster.\n[\n8\n]\nAt the end of March, Yip left Cloud9 for SK Gaming.\n[\n9\n]\nHe tried out to replace Epitacio \"TACO\" de Melo's spot on SK Gaming's active lineup.\n[\n10\n]\nAfter a three-month period,\nMade in Brazil\n(MIBR) signed the SK Gaming roster to play under MIBR's name.\n[\n11\n]\nMIBR traded Yip to Team Liquid for Epitácio \"TACO\" de Melo and head coach Wilton \"zews\" Prado in December 2018.\n[\n12\n]\nIn December 2019, Yip became the first North American CS:GO player to earn over $1,000,000 in tournament prize money after finishing runner up to\nAstralis\nin the ECS Season 8 Finals.\n[\n13\n]\nYip would go on to win 7 total tournaments with",

He is a member of the band Birth Defect.\nContents\n1\nHistory\n2\nAppearance and Personality\n2.1\nCommon Hairstyles\n2.2\nPersonality\n3\nRelationships\n4\nAchievements\n4.1\nTime travel\n4.2\nBirth Defect\n4.3\nHis role in educating the Super Mario Maker 2 community\n4.4\n1972 Nude Feature in Cosmopolitan Magazine\n5\nTrivia\n6\nReferences\nHistory\n[\n]\n\"Aurateur\" was originally a television show created in 1982 by Howard Aurastein and Sven Teurson. The concept was that a person would play pinball while viewers would come up to the stage and tell little stories or most often just gibberish for comedic effect. Later, the show evolved to play on arcade machines. After many years of adaptation and refinement, the show is still running on Twitch today with Super Mario Maker 2 being the primary game. The current Aurateur, Stanley Schmidt, is the twelfth Aurateur.\nAppearance and Personality\n[\n]\nCommon Hairstyles\n[\n]\nBald.\nPersonality\n[\n]\nAurateur has been known to have a loud and vivacious personality, full of passion and emotion at all times. However, the moment someone sends a TTS message in his stream, he immediately reverts into a numb and turtle-like state for the rest of the stream, in which he is only able to feel anything when chat members are suffering financially or when there is Bald representation in the video games he plays.\nRelationships\n[\n]\nAurateur has had a multitude of relationships, outside of various affairs with mothers of the viewers of the show. One of the most well-known personalities around Aurateur is his old crush\nSarah\n, and her boyfriend\nTanner\n. Tanner went to high school with Aurateur, during which Tanner would relentlessly bully Aurateur every day. The conflict hit its apex when Tanner invited his crush Sarah to prom, crushing Aurateur's hopes and dreams of ever getting laid.\nAurateur spots one of the last remaining Alabama Beach Mice, moments before slaughtering it senselessly.\nThere have been multiple eye witnesses that recognized Aurateur with long luscious flowing hair as a former construction worker for commercial development on the coast of the Alabama beach. Notably enjoying the destruction of local wild life that came with the job, his most favorite was, \"crushing those damn mice.\"\nAfter an alleged train accident where tangled hair was caught on the train wheels, he went missing for many years. Experts theorize he seeks repentance from\nMarvisjj\nfor his atrocities against the Alabama Beach Mouse to this day and is unworthy to be in Marvisjj's grace because of his past actions. In multiple interviews, Marvisjj has forgiven Aurateur and says that he constantly has to turn down becoming a moderator so that he can proclaim the urgent information of the ABM as a lowly viewer.\nIn March of 2020, Aurateur began a long-term relationship with the\nAlabama Beach Mouse\nuntil its eventual extinction in May of 2020 in which it is rumored that Aurateur violently beat it to death with his glasses (shattering the frame) during a domestic dispute over their beachfront properties. A hit-piece published in the Featuring Worth Times even implicated governor\nAl Bama\n, claiming the governor covered up the death as repayment for Aurateur's continued donations towards Bama's campaigns for pregnant Fortnite skins.\nAchievements\n",

He was born in 1958 to Momma and Papa Hart on planet Earth. He lives in a mobile home, held hostage by his two cats, Shadow and Ginger.\nCaleb Hart\nAliases\nClabe, Muscle Man, Ginger Man, Calubhat, Calebfart, MollyHart42, Gayleb\nRelatives\nPapa Hart, Mama Hart, Ryan Hart, Shadow, Ginger\nAffiliation\nThe CORE\nOccupation\nAngry MMX/FF7 Strimmur\nBiographical information\nDate of birth\n2006\nPlace of birth\nBrazil\nPhysical description\nGender\nMale\nDespite his best efforts to play video games quickly, he is always foiled by two grand evil forces: RNG, and his ISP.\nSouthern Illinois scientists have discovered what they are calling “the unluckiest human ever”. The unfortunate individual, a redhead , pasty skin, toxic muscle man, discovered this condition by badly playing a a children’s game named ‘Pokemon Red’. “It’s literally unbelievable, dude”, the man told scientists. “I play every game perfectly, but the RNG just keep cucking me!” The man continued to whine incessantly until, unfortunately, he dropped dead of a soy overdose.\nStreaming Career\n[\n]\nCaleb Hart Started off small, streaming Earthbound, Super Mario 64, and Fortnite. He discovered his potent talent for speed running\nMega Man X\nand made that a central point for his stream for many years. By speed running we mean going up to Chill Penguin and then resetting when he does any slides kekw. He also sometimes gives his viewers the coveted\nHexafecta\n.\nCaleb mostly runs\nFinal Fantasy 7\nthese days, since he likes playing long games that make you reset 3 hours into a run. It brings the viewers in, or so he says. Have fun missing Bio on Materia Keeper SMILERS.\nAfter a lengthy battle against his ISP and temporary refuge in the Library of Knowledge, Caleb moved into a new home which, according to chat, sucks and is much worse than the old room. He's gone back to variety streaming more or less, though he seems to favor\nIronmon\nlately. Much to the delight of the ADHD gamblers in his chat.\nCommon Caleb look-alikes\n[\n]\nA Weasley from Harry Potter\nChucky Finster from Rugrats\nRalphie from A Christmas Story\nGeorge Little from Stuart Little\nLewis from Meet the Robinsons\nTodd from Breaking Bad\nGuile from Street Fighter\nThe Nerd Rage Vault Boy from Fallout\nJohnny Bravo\nDuke Nukem\nYour mom gottem\nMedia\n[\n]\nA TAS Of CalebHart42's Twitch Stream\nTypical MMX speedrun\nWithout any makeup\nThe official ride armor\nIf you see this, just run\nAn epic gamer\nCaleb's not-so-little secret\nCaleb's streams in a nutshell\nCategories\nCategories\n:\nCharacters\nCommunity content is available under\nCC-BY-SA\nunless otherwise noted.\nAdvertisement\nExplore properties\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFollow Us\nOverview\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCommunity\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nAdvertise\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFandom Apps\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nCalebHart42 Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community.\nView Mobile Site\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab",

HeatoN was the manager of NiP up until October 2018 when he decided to part ways with the organisation to focus on his own brand. He is widely considered one of the best\nCounter-Strike\nplayers of all time.\nPlaying career\n[\nedit\n]\nThe name HeatoN comes from a brand of equipment, which is now owned by\nCCM\n, he used when he played\nice hockey\n. Emil's first hobby was ice hockey, but he retired because of an injury. A friend (CS player fRa1L, from RevolutioN) told him to try Counter-Strike. Christensen was part of the original Ninjas in Pyjamas team of 2001 which won the\nCyberathlete Professional League\nWorld Championship that year. He and the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas went on to become the foundation to the highly successful\nSK Sweden\n, one of the most successful teams in\nelectronic sports\nhistory.\n[\n2\n]\nChristensen led SK Gaming to the\nWorld Cyber Games\nCounter-Strike championship in 2003 and to 4th place in 2004.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nHeatoN and NiP competed in the\nWorld Series of Video Games\n.\n[\n5\n]\nChristensen was nominated for Best Counter-Strike Player of the Year in 2004, losing out to SK Gaming teammate, Tommy \"potti'\" Ingemarsson.\n[\n6\n]\nHe was selected for the Global Gaming League European Counter-Strike All-Star team in 2005.\n[\n7\n]\nAt the beginning of 2005, he and the rest of SK Sweden chose not to renew their contracts with SK Gaming and re-formed NiP.\n[\n8\n]\nSince then some of the NiP players moved back to SK Gaming but Christensen and others have stayed on at Ninjas in Pyjamas. NiP are now competing at professional LAN tournaments again, after a hiatus in which SpawN joined after HeatoN decided to take time off for personal reasons.\nChristensen, along with the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas, assisted in the design of the SteelSound 5H (USB) Headphones produced by\nSteelSeries\n.\nIn December 2006, he travelled to New York and Dallas to provide support for his teammates as they competed in the\nWorld Series of Video Games\n(WSVG) world finals and CPL winter respectively. NiP were expected to be strong contenders in both tournaments, however bowed out uncharacteristically early.\nIn June 2016, HeatoN became the first person inducted into the\nESL Hall of Fame\n.\n[\n9\n]\nManaging career\n[\nedit\n]\nIn September 2007, HeatoN quit playing\nCounter-Strike\nto be coach of NiP but was then offered a chance to be a general manager for Stockholm in the\nChampionship Gaming Series\n(CGS). HeatoN's CGS franchise was called the\nStockholm Magnetik\nand had a\nCounter-Strike: Source\nteam, one male and one female\nDead or Alive 4\nplayer, a\nFIFA 08\nplayer, and two\nForza Motorsport 2\nplayers.\nAfter the CGS's folding in late 2008 Christensen moved to promote a\ncomputer hardware\ncompany named Qpad,\n[\n10\n]\nfrom his native country Sweden, for the first part of 2009. Later in the year however, he left Qpad to join with his former teammate Abdisamad \"SpawN\" Mohamed in product development at ZOWIE GEAR which is a manufacturer of competitive gaming gear, founded late 2008.\n[\n11\n]\nIn July 2010, ZOWIE GEAR announced HeatoN's first series of mice co",

Following an open beta phase, the game was released for\nMicrosoft Windows\nin October 2013.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nA version for\nXbox One\nwas released in August 2017, and a\nPlayStation 4\nversion was released in March 2019.\nPath of Exile\ntakes place in a\ndark fantasy\nworld, where the government of the island nation of Oriath exiles people to the continent of Wraeclast, a ruined continent home to many ancient gods. Taking control of an exile, players can choose to play as one of seven\ncharacter classes\n– Marauder, Duelist, Ranger, Shadow, Witch, Templar, and Scion. Players are then tasked with fighting their way back to Oriath, defeating ancient gods and great evils during their journey.\nA sequel,\nPath of Exile 2\n, was released to early access on December 6, 2024. It was originally announced in 2019 as a large update for the original game. In 2023, the studio announced that it would instead be a separate game.\n[\n6\n]\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nThe player controls a single character from an overhead perspective and explores large outdoor areas and caves or dungeons, battling monsters and fulfilling quests from\nnon-player characters\n(NPCs) to gain\nexperience points\nand equipment. The game borrows heavily from the\nDiablo\nseries\n, particularly\nDiablo II\n,\n[\n7\n]\nof which\nPath of Exile\nhas been described as the\nspiritual successor\n.\n[\n8\n]\nAll areas aside from the central encampments are\nprocedurally generated\nfor increased re-playability. While all players on a single server can freely mingle in encampments, gameplay outside of encampments is highly\ninstanced\n, providing every player or party with an isolated map to freely explore.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nPlayers can choose from seven available\nclasses\nto play as (Duelist, Marauder, Ranger, Scion, Shadow, Templar and Witch).\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nEach of these classes are aligned with one or two of the three core\nattributes\n: Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence. The exception is the Scion, formerly a locked prestige class released in 2013, which is aligned with all three attributes. The different classes are not restricted from investing into skills not aligned with their core attributes, but will have easier access to skills that are aligned with their core attributes.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nItems are randomly generated from a wide variety of basic types and endowed with special properties and gem sockets. They come in different rarities with increasingly powerful properties. This makes a large part of gameplay dedicated to finding well-balanced and\nsynergistic\nequipment. Skill gems can be placed in gem sockets of armor, weapons and some types of rings,\n[\n7\n]\n[\n15\n]\ngiving them an active skill.

The game includes various modes, such as\nsingle-player\nand\nmultiplayer\ncompetitions.\nLaunched in 2013 by Anton Wallén, the game maintained a relatively small but active player base until 2020, when the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nand social media led to a significant influx of new players. In 2024, the game moved to a\nsubscription model\n.\nThe game has been described as an educational tool for geography, allowing players to learn and identify various global geographical and cultural characteristics. These include\nwriting systems\n,\narchitecture\n,\nleft- and right-hand traffic\n,\nflags\n,\nvehicle registration plates\n,\nlandscapes\n, and\nflora\n. This educational aspect enhances players' understanding of different cultures and regions around the world.\nGameplay\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nGeoGuessr\n\"classic\" view\nModes\n[\nedit\n]\nThe \"classic\"\nGeoGuessr\ngame mode consists of five rounds, each displaying a different street view location for the player to guess on a map. The player then receives a score of up to 5,000 points depending on how accurate their guess was, up to 25,000 points for a perfect game. Games may be user-generated or randomly generated from a pool of locations.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nAlternative game modes include:\nBattle Royale\n, a multiplayer\nlast man standing game\n.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nDuels, a two-player head-to-head competition.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n5\n]\nStreaks, where players identify countries or\nU.S. states\nuntil they guess incorrectly.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nExplorer Mode, a single-player game where medals are awarded for accuracy in individual countries\n[\n9\n]\nTeam Duels, a variation of Duels played between two teams.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n5\n]\nMaprunner\n, single-player game mode featuring a board game style interface.\n[\n11\n]\nSingleplayer\n, where players travel the world and its various cities while collecting tips to help them determine where they are.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 2022,\nGeoGuessr\nacquired the geography quiz site Seterra,\n[\n13\n]\nand implemented a quiz mode combining standard street view gameplay with trivia questions.\n[\n14\n]\nInterface\n[\nedit\n]\nThe game's\nHUD\nprimarily features the Google Street View imagery, as well as a compass. Users can control the movement, panning, and zooming of the image, although\nGeoGuessr\nallows any of these features to be disabled for harder gameplay. An inset map, using\nGoogle Maps\n's standard overlay, allows players to place a pin to make their guess.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nStrategy\n[\nedit\n]\nUsers may interpret their location from the photographs by reading\nroad signage\n, memorizing utility poles, finding the relative\nposition of the Sun\n, identifying\nflora\nand\nsoil types\n, and learning\ndiacritics\nspecific to particular\nwriting systems\n.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nPlayers can also make use of Street View\nmetadata\nto ascertain their location – for example, the\nStreet View vehicle\nthat captured imagery in\nKruger National Park\nwas unique in that it was green and had white\nroof racks\n.\n[\n18\n]\nDistribution\n[\nedit\n]\nGeoGuessr\nrequires a paid\nsubscription\nto play. A free mode, which restricted users to 5 minutes of game play every 15 minutes, was discontinued on 1 February 2024,\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nalthough challenges and quizzes are still free to play. Free-to-play users are still able to join and play in private parties hosted by a user with a subscription.\n[\n22\n]\nDevelopment\n[\n",

His channel has over one million followers on Twitch, and his\nYouTube\nchannel has over three million subscribers.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nScambaiting\n[\nedit\n]\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see\nScam baiting\n.\nIn mid-2017, Kitboga found out that his grandmother had fallen victim to many scams designed to prey on the elderly, both online and in person.\n[\n4\n]\nHe then discovered \"\nLenny\n\", a loop of vague pre-recorded messages that\nscam baiters\nplay during calls to convince the scammer that there is a real person on the phone without providing any useful information to the scammer. After seeing these videos uploaded to\nYouTube\n, he decided to replicate the calls himself. While he started out streaming for his friends on\nTwitch\n, his viewership soon started growing beyond his immediate circles. Kitboga hopes that by wasting scammers' time, he can prevent them from scamming others, while also providing entertainment and education to his viewers.\n[\n5\n]\nIn March 2020, with the growing prevalence of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n, Kitboga started baiting scammers who were selling an\nessential oil\nwhich they\ndishonestly claimed was a cure\nfor COVID-19, following a United States\nFederal Trade Commission\nwarning alerting consumers of coronavirus-related scams.\n[\n6\n]\nIn November 2020, Kitboga was signed by talent agency\nUTA\n.\n[\n7\n]\nIn May 2022, Kitboga was signed by Ryan Morrison's Evolved Talent Agency, again to expand Kitboga's goal of anti-scam messaging.\n[\n8\n]\nIn February 2023, Kitboga began working with\nAnyDesk\n, the creator of  the\nremote desktop software\noften used by scammers. AnyDesk's aim is to stop its software being used for fraud. While scambaiting, if a scammer uses AnyDesk as their remote desktop software, Kitboga could give an AnyDesk representative the current connection ID number, and in turn, AnyDesk can track and ban all scammers' devices from using AnyDesk within the same network.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nIn May 2023, Kitboga has partnered with\nKraken\n, a cryptocurrency exchange, to create a spoof Kraken account to trap scammers into giving wallet addresses from stolen crypto accounts, along with their personally identifiable information should they decide to sign up for an account.\n[\n11\n]\nTechnique\n[\nedit\n]\nIn his videos, Kitboga engages in scam baiting with several types of scammers. Besides\ntechnical support scammers\n, he also engages with\nrefund scammers\n,\nIRS scammers\n,\nsocial security scammers\n, and others. He mixes elements of popular culture into his dialogue and\nwordplay\ninto some calls;\n[\n5\n]\nfor example, in one March 2020 call against a scammer falsely claiming to sell a\nCOVID-19\ncure, Kitboga implied the scammer should be called \"Saint Anne\", eliding the two words to sound like \"\nSatan\n\".\n[\n6\n]\nTo misdirect scammers away from his real identity, as well as for viewer entertainment, Kitboga often poses as many different characters during his videos, including an elderly woman or man,\n[\n12\n]\na Russian man named Vicktor Viktoor,\n[\n13\n]\na\nvalley girl\nnamed Nevaeh (\n\"Heaven\" spelled backward\n),\n[\n14\n]\nor a competing technical support scammer named Daniel. He does this by imitating the accent or vocal intonation of the character he is trying to portray, often with a\nvoice changer\nto alter the pitch of his voice. The common factor uniting Kitboga's chara",

Kang is best known for her live streams on Twitch, for interviewing other streamers, content creators, and internet personalities as her alter ego persona CodeMiko,\n[\n4\n]\nand for pushing the envelope with regards to interactivity in VTuber technology.\n[\n11\n]\nKang created the CodeMiko persona using\nUnreal Engine\n, a\nmotion capture\nsuit\nfrom\nXsens\n,\nmotion capture gloves\nfrom Manus VR, and a\nfacial tracking\nhelmet from MOCAP Design.\n[\na\n]\n[\nb\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe CodeMiko\navatar\nis composed of 36,000\npolygons\n, modeled in\nAutodesk Maya\n, and textured using\nAdobe Substance\n.\nWhile Kang originally created CodeMiko alone, the project is now being developed by a team consisting of an\nengineer\n, an\nartist\n/\nanimator\n/\nrigger\n,\n[\n12\n]\na\npublicist\n, a\npersonal assistant\n, and a\nmanager\n.\n[\n13\n]\nKang now focuses on leading the development effort on\nbroadcasting\nand\nidea generation\n. Kang is focused not just on broadcasting but rather on introducing new standards of\ninteractivity\nwith her audience.\n[\n12\n]\nCodeMiko's virtual environment is designed to be\nquasi-interactive\n, meaning that viewers can influence and modify the CodeMiko avatar and surroundings by engaging in live stream chat or by donating money.\n[\n11\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nKang came up with the idea of CodeMiko while working at\nNickelodeon\n.\n[\n12\n]\nAfter being laid off due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n,\n[\n13\n]\nshe decided to pursue streaming full-time.\n[\n12\n]\nEarly on, she made around $300 per month from Twitch, which could not cover rent.\n[\n12\n]\nThis move was quite risky considering that Kang went into debt to acquire the Xsens Mo-cap suit,\n[\n14\n]\nin total, she accumulated over $20,000 in debt in order to get the setup she needed. She has attributed her success to this debt and her poor risk management.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n13\n]\nKang states that, since CodeMiko project has been a success, she can now afford a comfortable living.\n[\n13\n]\nStreaming\n[\nedit\n]\nKang had her streaming breakthrough in 2021. She has attributed her sudden rise in popularity due to having a viral tweet on\nTwitter\n[\n15\n]\nand going viral on r/LiveStreamFails on\nReddit\n.\n[\n14\n]\nCodeMiko\n[\nedit\n]\nThe CodeMiko avatar's\nin-universe\nbackstory is that she is a\nvideo game character\nwithout a game. She had always wanted to be in a\nmainstream video game\nbut never succeeded in doing so due to her '\nGlitch\n' (a story arc very similar to\nVanellope von Schweetz\nfrom the\nWreck-It Ralph\nfranchise). CodeMiko has expressed that she was forced to take smaller roles, such as a bush in\nThe Last of Us\n, following the archetypical story of the struggling\nHollywood\nactress, someone who just wants to be in a movie, any movie, but for Miko, any video game.\n[\n14\n]\nShe finally managed to find her way into Kang / The Technicians Unreal Engine project, thus becoming a Twitch streamer.\n[\n16\n]\nShe is currently roaming different game worlds, looking for a place she will fit in.

He competed in the\nFIDE World Cup\nin 2011 and 2013. Hansen has represented Canada in the\nChess Olympiad\n.\n[\n1\n]\nBiography\n[\nedit\n]\nHansen holds a dual citizenship as a Canadian and American. Hansen was born in\nIrvine, California\n[\n2\n]\nbut grew up in\nCalgary\n,\nAlberta\n. He first attended elementary school at\nWebber Academy\nwhere his chess roots formed a solid foundation during school chess club.\nIn a March 2016 interview with\nLa Presse\n, Hansen said he was diagnosed with\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) when he was 8 or 9 years old.\n[\n3\n]\nIn a 2015 article by sportsnet, Hansen said he was prescribed\nRitalin\ntemporarily and enrolled in a school for children with learning disabilities.\n[\n4\n]\nHansen attended the\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\nfor one year, beginning in September 2011, on a chess scholarship, representing the school in intercollegiate tournaments. He took a break from his studies to focus on chess full-time,\n[\n5\n]\nand made his European base in\nValencia\n,\nSpain\n, in autumn 2013.\n[\n6\n]\nChess career\n[\nedit\n]\nEric began playing chess in grade school at age nine. By 15, he became the youngest ever Alberta champion\n[\n7\n]\nand earned the title\nFIDE Master\n(FM). He became Alberta champion again in 2009,\n[\n8\n]\n2011,\n[\n9\n]\nand 2013.\n[\n10\n]\nIn 2011, Hansen tied for first place in the\nCanadian Closed Championship\nwith a score of 7½/9 points, but lost a two-game playoff to\nBator Sambuev\n, who was declared champion. Nevertheless, Hansen was nominated to play in the\nFIDE World Cup 2011\n.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nIn that event, Hansen played\nVugar Gashimov\n, losing both games. In a 4 September 2012 video interview at the Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, Hansen reflected on his 2011 World Cup experience: \"I got paired against Gashimov and he killed me. It was a good experience because I realized I wasn't serious enough to be competing with these guys. I'm more serious now ... it was good for motivating me.\"\n[\n13\n]\nHansen won the\nCanadian Open Chess Championship\nin\nVictoria, British Columbia\n, in July 2012.\n[\n14\n]\nThe next month, he tied for fifth place in the\nWorld Junior Chess Championship\nin\nAthens\n,\nGreece\n, scoring 9/13 points,\n[\n15\n]\nthe best-ever finish by a Canadian in this event; the previous best had been Vinny Puri's tie for 8th place in 1988.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAt the Isthmia Open tournament at\nVrachati\na few days later, Hansen scored his first Grandmaster\nnorm\nwith a tie for 1st–3rd place.\n[\n16\n]\nHansen achieved his final Grandmaster norm in the\n40th Chess Olympiad\n, in\nIstanbul\n,\nTurkey\n, in August–September 2012,\n[\n17\n]\nwhere he made his debut on the Canadian national team. He played on board four and scored 7½/10 points, boosting his FIDE rating by 25 points, reaching 2500 (the minimum for the GM title). Hansen is the second-youngest Canadian to attain the title of Grandmaster, after\nMark Bluvshtein\n, who did so at age 16 in 2004, and the youngest homegrown Canadian (because Bluvshtein received\nIsraeli\nyouth chess training systems before immigrating to Canada in 1999 at age 11).\nFIDE\nawarded him the title in January 2013.\n[\n18\n]\nHansen tied for first place at the October 2012\nAmerican Continental Championship\nin\nMar del Plata\n, Argentina, with\nJulio Granda Zuñiga\n,\nAlexander Shabalov\n,\nDiego Flores\n, and\nGregory Kaidanov\n. Since there were four qualifying places for the\n2013 World Cup\n, Hansen played a\nrapidplay\nplayoff with the other four, finishing fourth.\n[\n19\n]\nIn December, he won the 2nd Panama Open, scoring 8",

While there, he participated in the 2004\nDARPA Grand Challenge\n, a pivotal event in the development of autonomous vehicle technology.\n[\n3\n]\nVogt also interned at\niRobot\n, the company known for creating the\nRoomba\nand competed in two seasons of\nBattleBots\n.\n[\n4\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nJustin.tv\n[\nedit\n]\nIn his junior year, Vogt left MIT to join the team that would create Justin.tv and later Twitch.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n5\n]\nAs a co-founder of Justin.tv, Vogt was noted for his technical proficiency, often solving complex coding challenges and designing camera systems crucial for live streaming.\n[\n6\n]\nIn June 2011, Vogt co-founded two spin-off companies:\nSocialcam\n(later acquired by\nAutodesk\nin 2012 for $60 million) and Twitch (subsequently acquired by\nAmazon\nfor $970 million in 2014).\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nCruise Automation\n[\nedit\n]\nIn October 2013, Vogt founded Cruise Automation, serving as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Technology Officer.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe company, which develops self-driving car technology, participated in\nY Combinator\n, a startup accelerator. In March 2016, General Motors acquired Cruise Automation for over $1 billion, with Cruise continuing to operate as an independent subsidiary.\n[\n12\n]\nFollowing the acquisition, Vogt and Cruise Co-Founder Dan Kan became the youngest senior directors at GM. Vogt and Kan were listed as number 7 on\nFortune\n's 2016\n40 Under 40\nList.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n13\n]\nIn December 2021, after Cruise CEO\nDan Ammann\nleft the company, Vogt became interim CEO until February 2022 when he became CEO, maintaining his CTO and President titles.\n[\n14\n]\nIn November 2023, Vogt resigned as CEO following the\nCalifornia DMV\n's suspension of Cruise's autonomous operations in the state.\n[\n15\n]\nA subsequent internal investigation by\nQuinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan\nlaw firm identified poor leadership at Cruise and instances where Vogt withheld information from media.\n[\n16\n]\nWhile the firm concluded that \"no Cruise executives or employees intentionally deceived regulators,\" Cruise's failure to correct the public narrative \"caused both regulators and the media to accuse Cruise of misleading them,” according to the\nWall Street Journal\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Bot Company\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2024, Vogt launched The Bot Company, a robotics startup aimed at developing household task-oriented robots.\n[\n18\n]\nThe company launched with $150 million in seed funding from investors such as\nSpark Capital\nand\nNat Friedman\namong others.\n[\n19\n]\nThe Bot Company was valued at $550 million as of May 2024.\n[\n18\n]\nAnimal advocacy and",

It was released on December 1, 2003, as the second single from his second album,\nStill Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry\n(2004). It was produced by\nLil Jon\nand is an example of a\ncrunk\nsong. The single peaked at number seven on the US\nBillboard\nHot 100\nin July 2004.\nBackground and recording\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2000, following an appearance on the remix of the\nBlack Rob\nsingle \"\nWhoa!\n\", Petey Pablo caught the attention of record producer\nTimbaland\n, as well as the\nA&R\nmanager of\nJive Records\n, who helped Pablo acquire a deal with the record label.\n[\n2\n]\nPablo's first single, \"\nRaise Up\n\", was an instant commercial success, reaching the top 25 on the US\nBillboard\nHot 100\nand receiving heavy airplay on\nMTV\n.\n[\n2\n]\nDiary of a Sinner: 1st Entry\n, his debut studio album, was released later in the year and initially sold well due to the success of \"Raise Up\": however, the follow-up singles \"I Told Y'all\" and \"I\" failed to have any major impact on the charts. Consequently, Pablo's material received very little promotion from Jive over the next few years and the release of his second album\nStill Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry\n, originally set for 2002, was postponed indefinitely: it was not released until 2004.\n[\n2\n]\nDespite these delays, Pablo continued to record material for the album, eventually completing it during 2003.\n[\n3\n]\nHe recorded \"Freek-a-Leek\" following studio sessions with Atlanta rapper\nLil Jon\n, whose popularity had increased following his work with southern hip hop duo the\nYing Yang Twins\n.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nBefore Lil Jon began work with Petey Pablo, at the request of Jive he had made fifteen productions for American rapper\nMystikal\n, who also recorded for the label, although he passed most of them on. One of these, the production that would eventually become \"Freek-a-Leek\", was given to Pablo by Jive without Jon's knowledge, after which he recorded the song.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nMeanwhile, thinking that the beat had not been used, Lil Jon gave the production to American singer\nUsher\nfor his single \"\nYeah!\n\", from which a rough version of the song was recorded, mixed and mastered.\n[\n5\n]\nAlthough Lil Jon eventually realized the mistake after Pablo played him \"Freek-a-Leek\" during one of their studio sessions, Pablo was unwilling to give up the song, especially as it was already receiving airplay on Southern hip hop radio.\n[\n5\n]\nAs a result, Lil Jon created an entirely new instrumental for \"Yeah!\",\n[\n5\n]\nand Jive Records solicited \"Freek-a-Leek\" as the first single from\nStill Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry\non December 16, 2003, through release as a\nvinyl single\n.\n[\n6\n]\nComposition and lyrics\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nSouthern hip hop\nsong of three minutes and fifty-five seconds in length,\n[\n7\n]\n\"Freek-a-Leek\" draws heavily from the musical genre of\ncrunk\n, while being backed by an instrumentation which features a \"slowly strolling riff\", as well as following a tempo described as \"heavy-\nsynthed\nmarching band-inspired\".\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nIt begins and ends with a fake radio show, with Pablo acting as an impromptu host as well as introducing the song.\n[\n7\n]\nPablo's vocals are built around a \"\nnovation\nsynth\n\" based melody, with a\nflute\nbecoming audible during the chorus as well as a set of \"cleverly layered vocal chants\".\n[\n9\n]\nThe lyrics of \"Freek-a-Leek\" were noted for their heavily sexually explicit nature: according to David Jeffries of\nA",

He is known for popularizing creative use of\nAuto-Tune\npitch correction\n, often used with extreme parameter settings to create\nelectronic\n-styled vocal performances. Blending its use with\nR&B\nand\nhip-hop\nsensibilities, T-Pain became a prominent figure in both genres throughout the 2000s. Other music industry artists, such as\nLil Wayne\n,\nKanye West\n,\nFuture\n, and\nTravis Scott\n, have since utilized Auto-Tune to a similar effect.\nT-Pain began his recording career as part of the hip-hop group Nappy Headz. He released his debut solo mixtape,\nBack @ It\nindependently in 2004, and signed with\nAkon\n's\nKonvict Muzik\n, in a joint venture with\nJive Records\n, the following year. His 2005 debut single, \"\nI'm Sprung\n\", was quickly met with commercial success, peaking at number eight on the\nBillboard\nHot 100\nand receiving\nplatinum\ncertification by the\nRecording Industry Association of America\n(RIAA). Its follow-up, \"\nI'm 'n Luv (wit a Stripper)\n\" (featuring\nMike Jones\n), peaked at number five on the chart; both served as lead singles for his debut studio album,\nRappa Ternt Sanga\n(2005). Despite moderate critical and commercial reception, his second album,\nEpiphany\n(2007), peaked atop the US\nBillboard\n200\nand spawned the\nBillboard\nHot 100-number one single \"\nBuy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\n\" (featuring\nYung Joc\n), as well as the top-40 single, \"\nBartender\n\" (featuring Akon). His third album,\nThree Ringz\n(2008), was preceded by the single \"\nCan't Believe It\n\" (featuring Lil Wayne), and his fourth album,\nRevolver\n(2011), was preceded by \"\n5 O'Clock\n\" (featuring\nWiz Khalifa\nand\nLily Allen\n). His fifth album,\nOblivion\n(2017) sustained long-term delays and was met with critical and commercial failure, serving as his final release on a\nmajor label\n.\nMeanwhile, T-Pain saw continued success as a guest performer on nine Hot 100-top ten singles—\"\nShawty\n\" by\nPlies\n, \"\nCyclone\n\" by\nBaby Bash\n, \"\nGood Life\n\" by Kanye West, \"\nShawty Get Loose\n\" by\nLil Mama\n, \"\nGot Money\n\" by Lil Wayne, \"\nBlame It\n\" by\nJamie Foxx\n, and \"\nHey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)\n\" by\nPitbull\n—which includes two singles that peaked the chart: \"\nKiss Kiss\n\" by\nChris Brown\nand \"\nLow\n\" by\nFlo Rida\n. The latter was named third in the\nBillboard\nHot 100 Songs of the Decade and received\ndiamond (10× platinum)\ncertification by the RIAA. \"Good Life\" and \"Blame It\" both won\nGrammy Awards\nfor\nBest Rap Song\nand\nBest Rap/Sung Performance\n, ",

The weapon used by this task force is an urban assault vehicle that masquerades as a\nDodge Viper\nRT/10\nroadster and coupe (later, the\nViper GTS\n). The series takes place in \"the near future\". The primary brand of vehicles driven in the show were\nChrysler\nor subsidiary companies. The series ran on\nNBC\nfor one season in 1994 before being revived two years later for three more seasons of\nfirst-run syndication\n. Reruns of the series have appeared on\nSci-Fi Channel\nand\nUSA Network\n.\nThe Viper Defender \"star car\" was designed by Chrysler Corporation engineers unlike most\nHollywood\nfilm/television cars that are usually customized by film picture designers. The exterior design of the car was produced by Chrysler stylist Steve Ferrerio.\nNBC run\n[\nedit\n]\nThe original series began filming in\nLos Angeles Area\nin early 1993 and was planned to debut on CBS in Fall 1993. However, it was first delayed when\nStephen J. Cannell\nalso named\nhis new TV show\nViper\n.\n[\n1\n]\nAfter a lawsuit by Chrysler Corporation, Cannell renamed his show\nCobra\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThe premiere of\nViper\nwas delayed further when CBS deemed the series to be too violent and decided to bury it. However, due to Chrysler's backing, production of the series proceeded, and was picked up by\nNBC\n.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nThe series originally aired on NBC during the 1993–1994 season, debuting on January 2, 1994 with a two-hour pilot movie, as a mid-season replacement for\nAgainst the Grain\nin NBC's Friday Night 8PM slot. After falling ratings, the series was canceled in April 1994.\nThe music for the pilot and opening theme for season 1 was composed by Eddie Jobson. Jay Ferguson took over music composition for the rest of the seasons. He composed a remixed theme of the original season-1 opening and the brand new season-4 opening theme.\nThe\nDodge Viper RT/10 Roadsters\nused in seasons 1–3 were actually not production models. Instead, Chrysler supplied various leftover\nengineering mules\nand\nprototypes\nof the Viper (still visually the same). Many other cars in season 1 were leftover\nprototypes\n, as well. For example, in the pilot movie, the\nEagle Premier\nsedans with yellow vinyl stripes were drivetrain engineering mules for the LH cars (Dodge Intrepid/Chrysler Concorde).\nThe special effect \"hex snakeskin\" transformation for the pilot and the first season was done by Metrolight Studios. Tim Claycomb and Tim Eilers took over the transformation sequence after the first season. Sources indicate that it cost $50,000 for each transformation scene in the NBC season.\nFirst-run syndication version\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n.

During his career at MLG, he was chosen to host the daily MLG live show as a replacement for his colleague Chris Puckett, who was unwell. According to the league, Dunlop \"did such a good job\" that he was later permitted by the league to co-host for the next six weeks.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nFrom 2014 through 2018, Dunlop hosted and cast many major\nCall of Duty\nesports events\n[\n4\n]\nincluding the Call of Duty World League Championship in 2016, 2017, and 2018, MLG tournaments Pro League in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and UMG tournaments in 2015 and 2016.\n[\n5\n]\nOn March 2, 2018, he announced his transition from MLG to the\nCall of Duty\nfranchise.

Although the secret was leaked a few days before the announcement by\nNinja\n, his signing had been suspected by his fanbase, as he was already living in the team's content house with friends and fellow streamers Matthew \"\nNadeshot\n\" Haag and Rachell \"\nValkyrae\n\" Hofstetter.\n[\n10\n]\nAfter developing an online friendship with artist\nAriana Grande\n, Dunlop went on to make a parody of Ariana Grande's song \"\nBoyfriend\n\", to which she replied, \"You're perfect.\"\n[\n11\n]\nDunlop and his girlfriend were also featured in Grande and\nJustin Bieber\n's music video \"\nStuck with U\n\".\n[\n12\n]\nOn November 4, 2019, Dunlop announced his switch from streaming on Twitch to streaming on YouTube through a comedic skit featuring other 100 Thieves house members.\n[\n13\n]\nHe cited reasons like stability and \"the fear of being tied down just for a sub count button\", along with other factors like conveying a wider range of content, as the main reasons for his departure from the platform.\n[\n14\n]\nOn April 23, 2020, during a twelve-hour charity birthday stream with the purpose of raising money for\ncoronavirus\nrelief, Dunlop received a total of $250,000 in donations within the first four hours of the stream and ended the stream with approxi",

Subplots in the third series include Albert's ongoing efforts to find his place, culminating in\nThe Great Exhibition\n(1851), and his efforts",

For the films, see\nSociety Girl (1932 film)\nand\nSociety Girl (1976 film)\n.\nPoster for the film\n\"It\"\n(1927), starring\nClara Bow\nAn \"\nit girl\n\"\n[\na\n]\nis an attractive young woman who is perceived to have both\nsex appeal\nand a personality that is especially engaging.\n[\n1\n]\nThe expression\nit girl\noriginated in British upper-class society around the turn of the 20th century.\n[\n2\n]\nIt gained further attention in 1927 with the popularity of the\nParamount Studios\nfilm\nIt\n, starring\nClara Bow\n. In the earlier usage, a woman was especially perceived as an \"it girl\" if she had achieved a high level of popularity without flaunting her sexuality. Today, the term is used more to apply simply to fame and beauty. The\nOxford English Dictionary\ndistinguishes between the chiefly American usage of \"a glamorous, vivacious, or sexually attractive actress, model, etc.\", and the chiefly British usage of \"a young, rich woman who has achieved celebrity because of her\nsocialite\nlifestyle\".\n[\n3\n]\nThe terms \"\nit boy\n\" or \"\nit man\n\" are sometimes used to describe a male exhibiting similar traits.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly use\n[\nedit\n]\nAn early literary usage of\nit\nin this sense is found in a 1904 short story by\nRudyard Kipling\n(Traffics and Discoveries (1904) ‘Mrs Bathurst’), which contains the line \"'Tisn't beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It's just It. Some women'll stay in a man's memory if they once walk down a street.\"\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nElinor Glyn\n, the notorious British novelist who wrote the book titled\nIt\nand its subsequent screenplay, lectured:\nWith\nIt\n, you win all men if you are a woman and all women if you are a man.\nIt\ncan be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.\n—\nElinor Glyn (1927)\n[\n6\n]\nGlyn first rose to fame as the author of the scandalous 1907 bestseller\nThree Weeks\n. She is widely credited with the invention of the \"it girl\" concept: although the slang predates her book and film, she was responsible for the term's impact on the culture of the 1920s.\n[\n7\n]\nIn 1927, the\nParamount Studios film\nwas planned as a special showcase for its popular star\nClara Bow\n, and her performance\n[\n8\n]\nintroduced the term \"it\" to the cultural lexicon. The film plays with the notion that \"it\" is a quality which eschews definitions and categories; consequently, the girl portrayed by Bow is an amalgam of an\ningenue\nand a\nfemme fatale\n, with some qualities later portrayed by\nMadonna\n's latter day \"\nMaterial Girl\n\" incarnation. By contrast, Bow's rival in the script is equally young and comely, as well as rich and well-bred, yet is portrayed as not possessing \"it\". Clara Bow later said she wasn't sure what \"it\" meant,\n[\n9\n]\nalthough she identified\nLana Turner\n[\n9\n]\nand later\nMarilyn Monroe\n[\n10\n]\nas \"it girls\".\n[\n9\n]\nThe fashion component of the \"it girl\" originated with Glyn's elder sister,\ncouturier\nLucy, Lady Duff-Gordon\n, known professionally as \"Lucile\". Lucile managed exclusive salons in London, Paris and New York, was the first designer to present her collections on a stage complete with the theatrical accoutrements of lights and music (inspiring the modern\nrunway\nor catwalk show), and was famous for making sexuality an aspect of fashion through her provocative\nlingerie\nand lingerie-inspired clothes.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nShe also specialised in dressing trendsetting stage and film performers, ranging from the stars of the\nZiegfeld Follies\non Broadway to silent screen icons such as\nMary Pickford\nand\nIrene Castle\n.\nAs early as 1917, Lucil",

Directed and produced by\nNaoki Yoshida\nand released worldwide for\nPlayStation 3\nand\nWindows\nin August 2013, it replaced the\nfailed 2010 version\n, with subsequent support for\nPlayStation 4\n,\nmacOS\n,\nPlayStation 5\n, and\nXbox Series X/S\n.\nFinal Fantasy XIV\nis set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity which ended the original version. In the Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut escaped from his prison, an ancient space station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, the\nplayer character\nof the original version escaped, reappearing at the start of\nA Realm Reborn\n. As Eorzea cements its recovery, the player must fend off a reignited invasion from the Garlean Empire.\nThe original\nFinal Fantasy XIV\nwas a commercial and\ncritical failure\n. Then-Square Enix President\nYoichi Wada\nannounced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would assume control and address the game's flaws. The new team both continued to develop and improve the original version, and secretly worked on a completely new replacement. This new game, codenamed \"Version 2.0\", used a new\nengine\n, improved server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, interface, and story. The original version shut down in November 2012, followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.\nThe relaunched game released to largely positive reception; critics praised its solid mechanics and progression, and commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. After a poor 2013\nfiscal year\n, Square Enix attributed the 2014 return to profitability partly to the game's strong sales and subscriber base. By October 2021, it had gained over 24 million registered players and become the most profitable\nFinal Fantasy\ngame to date.\n[\n1\n]\nFinal Fantasy XIV\nhas received regular updates since release, including five major\nexpansion packs\n:\nHeavensward\n(2015),\nStormblood\n(2017),\nShadowbringers\n(2019),\nEndwalker\n(2021), and\nDawntrail\n(2024).

Another runner, TaylorTotFTW created the run using\ntool-assisted speedrun\n(TAS) software. It debuted live on Zfg's Twitch channel.\n[\n6\n]\nIn 2018, Zfg helped construct a list of lesser-known secrets in\nOcarina of Time\nfor\nIGN\n. It was put together to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the game and featured techniques and mechanics known to\nspeedrunners\nof the game.\n[\n7\n]\nThat same year, he also completed randomised 100% runs\nOcarina of Time\nusing a modified version of the original game that unpredictably adjusts variables and create special world-states. Randomised runs can change where doors and exits lead and where items are located.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nIn 2019, Zfg produced and released a TAS of\nOcarina of Time\nwhich showcased what a humanly-perfect run of the 100% completion category would be. On its live debut, the run finished nearly 15 minutes faster than his then-current record of 3:53:33.\n[\n10\n]\nIn 2020, after a break from running the 100% category, Zfg took back the world record for it with a time of 3:43:44, fourteen seconds faster than the previous record.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nAt the end of 2020, he completed a run of Ocarina of Time in the 100% (SRM) category with a time of 3 hours, 12 minutes and 55 seconds.\n[\n13\n]\nZfg has run\nOcarina of Time\nat\nAwesome Games Done Quick\n(AGDQ) several times.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nIn October 2021, Zfg's comments about the inclusion of\nNintendo 64\ngames under the\nNintendo Switch Online\nservice garnered attention. Writing about Ocarina of Time's\nemulation\nand\ninput lag\n, he stated that the game \"on\nSwitch\nis so bad it might be worse than [\nWii U Virtual Console\n's version].\"\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nStatements made by Zfg, alongside\nKentucky\n-based speedrunner Toufool, were notable as both were renowned within Ocarina of Time's speedrunning community.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nSub-four hour speedrun\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2018, Zfg accomplished the first 100% speedrun of\nOcarina of Time\nunder four hours.\n[\n19\n]\nHis record was recorded at 3:58:45.\n[\n20\n]\nIt had been more than five years since the last hour barrier was crossed.\n[\n20\n]\nAt the time, Zfg had held the 100% record since March 2015.\n[\n20\n]\nHe was able to lower the time to under four hours with newly discovered glitches and shortcuts discovered within a month of the record. In total, Zfg stated that the discovered glitches and exploits lowered five minutes off of the run.\n[\n21\n]\nZfg posted a video on YouTube explaining the discovered breakthroughs in further detail.

In 2012, he played on Severity Gaming, but it wasn't until 2014 that he joined his first serious team.\n2015 Preseason\n[\nedit\n]\nLourlo joined Storm in September 2014 as one of the team's founding members, along with hairyabs, mandatorycloud, xPecake, and\nbabyeator\n. The team was initially going to attempt to qualify for the 2015 spring LCS via the Expansion Tournament. However, because Lourlo would not turn 17 until March 24, 2015, the team decided to keep Lourlo on the roster and play in the Challenger scene for one split instead.\n2015 season\n[\nedit\n]\nLourlo left Storm and later joined\nCLG Black\nafter Westrice left, beginning to play for them in the second week of the NACS Spring Season. The team placed 6th and last in the season, after losing a tiebreaker game to TSM Darkness. CLG Black retained their summer season qualifier seed from having participated in the spring season, receiving a first-round bye. However, after defeating Maelstrom, they lost to Cloud9 Tempest and then to Magnetic, missing out on the NACS summer season.\n2016 season\n[\nedit\n]\nIn January, Team Liquid announced Lourlo as their top laner for the 2016 NA LCS Spring Season, filling the gap left by Quas's suspension. Liquid's spring split started out rocky, with an 0-2 first week and cumulative wins of 50% or worse after each of the first eight weeks. Eventually, their new roster started to solidify, and they climbed into a fourth-place regular-season finish, behind the newly formed and almost-undefeated Immortals, CLG, and Cloud9. Their quarterfinal series was an easy 3–0 over NRG, but in the semifinals, they lost a narrow five-game series to CLG (the eventual champions). In the fifth game, Piglet was caught out in mid-lane by a double-teleport from both Darshan and Huhi at the same time to the same ward and died. While Liquid was already behind in that game, it was this play that sealed the win for their opponents. In the third-place series against the tournament-favorite Immortals who had been knocked down in an upset by TSM, Liquid lost once ag",

She makes videos about her life in South Korea.\nAfter spending three months self-studying\nKorean\nin Hong Kong, Mira moved in 2015 to South Korea, where she took classes at\nSogang University\n's\nlanguage school\n. In 2016, she started a YouTube channel called \"Mira's Garden\", where she covered life in South Korea, South Korean culture, and her travels. At the beginning of 2021, she founded Mongcow, an\ne-commerce\nbusiness where she sold Mira-curated South Korean products and Mira-branded products. In November 2021, Mira started Hong Kong Fusion, a Hong Kong-style restaurant in\nSeoul\n. That year, her YouTube channel was the seventh most-subscribed Hong Kong YouTube channel with 730,000 subscribers.\nEarly life and education\n[\nedit\n]\nMira was born on 7 October 1992 in Hong Kong.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nShe recalled that when she was six or seven years old, her mother went out to buy food and was able to purchase only a small box of\nchar siu rice\n.\n[\n5\n]\nLooking back on that incident, she reflected that her family's finances during her youth were in a challenging state.\n[\n5\n]\nWhile living in Hong Kong, she self-studied the\nKorean language\nfor three months before moving to South Korea, where she studied at\nSogang University\n's\nlanguage school\nfor half a year in 2014.\n[\na\n]\nHer interest in learning the Korean language was inspired by encounters with South Korean customers while she was working in Hong Kong. She learned the language out of personal interest and did not have any plans about what to do with that knowledge.\n[\n6\n]\nAfter finishing her studies at Sogang University, she returned to Hong Kong for a year before going back to live in South Korea in 2016.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n8\n]\nBy 2018, she had become fluent in Korean.\n[\n6\n]\nYouTube channel and career\n[\nedit\n]\nMira's South Korea lifestyle vlog published on 27 February 2020. In the video, she deals with a Korean visa, meets with a YouTube manager, shops online, responds to YouTube comments, and cooks and eats food.\nMira started a YouTube channel in June 2016.\n[\n5\n]\nIn a rush to create the YouTube channel, she chose the name \"Mira's Garden\" because she wanted to create a space that was her own. A previous channel she considered was \"Mira's Secret\". Mira said that a downside in her choice of channel name was that including an\napostrophe\nmade it harder to search for. She observed other people use their first name and surname as their YouTube channels. Despite harbouring regret over her choice of channel name, Mira decided to keep it unchanged owing to the long time she had used it.\n[\n6\n]\nAt its inception, the channel covered her life in South Korea before discussing her travels to other places in the region.\n[\n6\n]\nShe covered food and South Korean culture in her videos.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n9\n]\nVideo topics include how to become acquaintances with a Korean \"oppa\" and reasons a person should not date Korean men.\n[\n6\n]\nIn 2017, she visited a juice store in\nJiufen\nin Taiwan, to purchase red\nguava\njuice.

It holds the\nGuinness World Record\nfor having \"the most users to input a command to play a live streamed videogame\" with 1,165,140 participants.\n[\n1\n]\nThe concept was developed by an anonymous Australian programmer and launched on 12 February 2014, starting with the game\nPokémon Red\n. The stream became unexpectedly popular, reaching an average concurrent viewership of over 80,000 viewers (with at least 10% participating). On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment.\n[\n2\n]\nOn 5 December 2014, Twitch Plays\nPokémon\nreceived a\nGame Award\nin the \"Best Fan Creation\" category.\n[\n3\n]\nThe experiment was met with attention by media outlets and staff members of Twitch for its interactivity, its erratic and chaotic nature, the unique challenges faced by players due to the mechanics of its system, and the community and\nmemes\ndeveloped by participants. Twitch as a company used the experiment to explore how they could make streaming more interactive for viewers and expand their offerings. Following the completion of\nRed\n, the broadcaster continued the channel with many other games in the\nPokémon\nseries along with unofficial\nROM hacks\n. The broadcaster has plans to continue with other\nPokémon\ngames as long as there remains interest in the channel. The success of the experiment led to a number of similar Twitch-based streams for other games, and led Twitch to promote more streams with similar interactivity with watchers.\nPremise\n[\nedit\n]\nInspired by another Twitch-based interactive game,\nSalty Bet\n(a website where users can wager on the outcome of randomized\nM.U.G.E.N.\nmatches),\n[\n4\n]\nand described as a\nsocial experiment\n, the system used by the stream was coded by an anonymous Australian programmer, colloquially known as the \"Streamer\", consisting of an\nIRC bot\nwritten in\nPython\nand the\nGame Boy\nemulator\nVisualBoyAdvance\n. The script captures specific case-insensitive messages (directional commands, \"B\", \"A\", \"select\", and \"start\") sent into the stream's chat room by users, and sends them to the emulator as button input, thus controlling the game. An additional web app coded using\nJavaScript\nis used to display a live tally of moves that are shown within the stream. The Streamer chose\nPokémon Red\nand\nBlue\nfor the project, citing nostalgia for the early games,\n[\n5\n]\nthe fact that \"Even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress in\nPokémon\n\",\n[\n6\n]\nand because its current control structure \"[wouldn't] work with any genre that isn't a\nJRPG\n\", particularly targeting its \"forgiving\" turn-based structure and lack of reaction-based gameplay, compensating for the large amount of\ninput lag\nbetween the game and the stream. The Streamer used an\nedited\nversion of the game, which claims to make all the original 151 Pokémon accessible, in hopes of making completion of the Pokédex a possibility. However, the edited version used was unfinished and has no gameplay differences when compared to the original game.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe erratic nature of the control scheme has made the game longer and harder to play than under normal circumstances;  an\nArs Technica\nwriter commen",

Range marketed games through the company PlayMassive GmbH, which runs a computer games website, but stepped back in January 2018. Gronkh is the most popular representative of the\nLet's Play\ngenre in Germany and the fourth biggest YouTuber in Germany.\nLife and work\n[\nedit\n]\nErik Range was born to a German father and a Russian mother in Braunschweig in 1977. He first gained recognition in the computer games industry as the guide for Bard characters that featured in the online role playing game\nMeridian 59\n. This is where he first used the gamer-tag \"Gronkh\", which he still uses today. Range said his pseudonym is a portmanteau of the name \"Gregor Onkh\". He has been managing partner and co-founder of PlayMassive GmbH since 2009.\n[\n2\n]\nFellow co-founder of the company is Valentin Matthias Rahmel, whose online pseudonym is\nSarazar\n. Rahmel collaborates with Range on YouTube.\n[\n3\n]\nSince 2010, Range has regularly published Let's Play videos, in which he talks about his progress in various games. He published his first video on 1 April 2010; a test recording for the online game\nAllods Online\n. Since then, he has become one of the most popular German-speaking providers of these formats. His\nYouTube channel\nhas had over 4 million subscribers and over 1.7 billion video views,\n[\n4\n]\nand is one of the most successful channels on the website. He is one of the first commercial German creators and providers of related videos. Range's work is supported by game manufacturers that want to promote for their own products through cooperation. The game developers of\nDaedalic Entertainment\nreported an increase in sales of\nEdna & Harvey: The Breakout\nafter the game was promoted on Range's channel.\n[\n5\n]\nSince early 2012, Gronkh was registered as a trademark to PlayMassive GmbH at the German Patent and Trademark Office.\n[\n6\n]\nRange has been in a relationship with Tatjana Werth (alias\nPandorya\n) since December 2012.\nIn 2018, Range left the PlayMassive GmbH and took the Gronkh trademark with him.\n[\n7\n]\nHe founded his own company\nGods of Gaming GmbH\n. Some gamers formerly employed by the PlayMassive GmbH followed him and are now employed by his new company.\nRange personally holds a German broadcasting license for\nGronkhTV\nand\nGronkh\nbroadcastin",

It began broadcasting on 10 July 1995\n[\n1\n]\nand it ended on 31 December 2004 with the presenters leaving. After eight months of being without presenters, it officially ended on 20 August 2005, and was replaced with\nToasted TV\n.\nIn January 2016, Lappin and Gatt launched the official Cheez TV Facebook page with the help of friend and podcaster Brendan Dando. The page features full episodes of the show from its original run, behind the scenes photos and competitions.\nCheez TV\nwas the first show in Australia to have an internet address in 1995.\n[\n2\n]\nGatt and Lappin reunited during 2017 and started a brief Twitch series called Cheez Live where they played video games, shared reviews of movies, read fan mail, or just had fun hanging out with their viewers. Despite it being popular, they reformatted it into a Youtube channel and podcast called The Jade and Ryan Show in 2018, which didn't last for very long. Before the year ended, the pair announced the cancellation of the show and went their separate ways (similar to what happened to the end of the original TV show). It is unknown what the cause of the breakup was, and they have since deleted all of their social media websites, however the official Cheez TV Facebook Fan page still operates. Their last public appearance was hosting the Australian 'SO POP' music festival in February 2019.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nInitially competing against\nAgro's Cartoon Connection\non the\nSeven Network\n, the younger youth hosts, 'edgier' feel, and larger focus on showing cartoons allowed Ten to take the early morning children's TV crown off Seven.\nDuring the show's run, Ryan Lappin was once nominated for\nCleo\nmagazine's Bachelor of the Year only to lose to Australian swimmer\nGeoff Huegill\n. Jade Gatt also hosted late night music show\nGround Zero\n.\nDuring the later years of the show, Lappin and Gatt's editorials were quickly becoming notorious for their use of more adult-oriented humour.\nOn 20 August 2005, the last episode of\nCheez TV\nwas broadcast after 10 years on the air, although Lappin and Gatt's final on-air appearance took place on 31 December 2004. In 2005, only cartoons showed during\nCheez TV\n. It was later replaced with\nToasted TV\nin the same time slot, which continues to screen series such as\nNaruto\n,\nOne Piece\nand\nWinx Club\n.\nIn 2010, a\nFacebook\nevent scheduled for 7 October 2010 appeared, attempting to gain interest in a Cheez TV reunion show. It quickly attracted the attention of Cheez TV fans. Jade and Ryan both had an interview with the E Team from U20 Radio Station which aired on 7 August 2010, where they briefly spoke to Peter Styles about the Facebook group and the show. However, after the group sent hundreds of petitioned emails to the networks, third parties\n[\nwho?\n]\nmade complaints which led to Facebook closing the group. It is unknown whether any consideration has been taken in relation to a\nCheez TV\nreunion by any network contacted.\nOn 28 June 2011, the Adelaide Anime and Videogame Convention\nAVCon\nannounced Cheez TV presenters Ryan Lappin and Jade Gatt as special guests.\n[\n3\n]\nThe pair appeared in multiple guest panels throughout the weekend.\n[\n4\n]\nOn 22 January 2016, Ryan and Jade launched the official Cheez TV Facebook page with the help of friend and podcaster Brendan Dando, co-host of the Simpsons podcast",

Having played competitively since 2005, Lindberg has been widely regarded within the esports scene as the greatest player in\nCounter-Strike\nhistory.\n[\n4\n]\nLindberg is best known for his four years of tenure on the\nFnatic\nroster, which he helped bring to prominence as the dominant team of 2009,\n[\n5\n]\nduring which year the team broke the record for the highest-earning team in\nCounter-Strike\nhistory.\n[\n6\n]\nNear the end of 2010, Lindberg left Fnatic and joined\nSK Gaming\n,\n[\n7\n]\nwhich he remained with until July 2012.\n[\n8\n]\nSoon after, he transitioned over to\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive\nand joined the team\nNinjas in Pyjamas\n.\n[\n9\n]\nIn 2020, Lindberg left NiP to join\nDignitas\n.\nProfessional career\n[\nedit\n]\nLindberg began his professional gaming career in early 2005, when he made his international debut at the global finals in\nSouth Korea\nfor the\nWorld e-Sports Games\n, alongside the new Swedish team of Begrip Gaming. There, Begrip defeated all opponents, including the defending champions Catch-Gamers and won the prize pot of 50,000\nUSD\n.\n[\n10\n]\nFollowing this victory, Lindberg dropped out of\nhigh school\nto concentrate on his\nCounter-Strike\ncareer.\n[\n11\n]\nIn 2005, Lindberg was nominated for the eSports Award 2005, under the categories for \"Newcomer of the Year\" and \"Best\nCounter-Strike\nPlayer\".\n[\n12\n]\nIn early 2006, Lindberg left Begrip alongside his teammate Kristoffer \"Tentpole\" Nordlund, and signed a contract with Fnatic and became a permanent member of the team.\n[\n13\n]\nLindberg's first year in Fnatic proved to be successful, having the team earn upwards of US$100,000, which was acknowledged by\nTurtle Entertainment\n. During 2006, Fnatic won the\nCyberathlete Professional League\nChampionship, the World Tour, along with a silver medal at the\nElectronic Sports World Cup\n. Lindberg was once again nominated for the eSports Award and won the\nCounter-Strike\nPlayer of the Year Award.\n[\n14\n]\nHowever, Fnatic faced a major slump from 2007 through 2008, as the team failed to win any major tournaments and only achieved a handful of medals.\n[\n15\n]\nThe team regained its form and chemistry in 2009, however, with the retirement of Oscar \"Archi\" Torgersen and Oscar \"ins\" Holm and the recruitment of\nChristopher \"GeT_Right\" Alesund\nand Rasmus \"GuX\" Ståhl.\n[\n16\n]\nDuring 2009, Fnatic was the single most-dominant team, having garnered gold medal victories at the\nIntel Extreme Masters\nGlobal Challenge, European Finals and World Championship, ESWC 2009, e-Stars Seoul, KODE5 and World eSports Masters. In 2009, Lindberg was nominated for the eSports Award 2009, under the category of \"Regional eSports Player of the Year Northern Europe\", but lost to his teammate Alesund, who won the main category for eSports Player of the Year.\n[\n17\n]\nFnatic could not repeat its success from 2009 in the 2010 season, however, as the team found itself at odds with the Ukrainians from",

Genburten tested multiple times for COVID-19 around the time of the tournament, and although he received one negative test, he would test positive on the first day of the tournament. Reignite were still able to win, though without Genburten and instead with British loan player \"jmw\".\n[\n7\n]\nOn 4 July 2022, Genburten left Reignite, along with Sharky and Zer0.\n[\n8\n]\nDarkZero\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter leaving Reignite, the trio signed with the American organization\nDarkZero Esports\n. The team won the 2022 ALGS Championship LAN, held in\nRaleigh\n, North Carolina.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nSharky would then leave the team, with Rody \"Xynew\" Geissle filling the roster spot. Genburten and DarkZero won the\n2023 ALGS Split 2 Playoffs\n.\n[\n11\n]\nWith the victory, Genburten and Zer0 became the only 3-time LAN championship winners in AGLS history.\n[\n12\n]\nFollowing the\n2023 ALGS Championship\n, Genburten played trial matches with Sweetdreams and Nafen, but ultimately decided to remain with DarkZero.\n[\n13\n]\nDuring the Year 4 North American Pro League regional finals, Genburten was one of two players to be affected by hacks. Genburten received a \"wallhack\", revealing the location of other players through walls and terrain.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nAs the match was occurring on a private lobby during a high-profile match, the hack was considered unprecedented by media outlets.\n[\n16\n]\nNME\nnoted that Genburten quickly alerted his teammates and left the match, \"presumably to avoid some sort of penalty for cheating in an official tournament match\".\n[\n17\n]\nGenburten detailed that he left after his teammate \"Sikezz\" suggested to and also stated that he feared his \"career was over\" because of the incident.\n[\n18\n]\nWith its competitive integrity compromised, the competition was postponed and held at a later date in secret, with Genburten and DarkZero placing in sixth.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nIn May, at the 2024 Split 1 Playoffs LAN, Genburten and DarkZero finished in second, runner-ups to\nReject Winnity\n.\n[\n21\n]\nTeam Falcons\n[\nedit\n]\nShortly following the 2024 Split 1 Playoffs LAN tournament, it was announced that Zer0 and Genburten would be leaving DarkZero.

In late 2011, he decided to pursue\nThe Needle Drop\nfull-time, but kept affiliation with WNPR until 2014.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n14\n]\nFantano was offered an album review show on\nAdult Swim\nbut declined.\n[\n8\n]\nBy the end of 2017, Fantano had reached a million subscribers and diversified his content to include weekly \"track roundup\" videos, livestreamed Q&As, and video think-pieces alongside his album reviews.\n[\n16\n]\nTo earn enough money to pay his editor Austin Walsh, by November 2016, Fantano was recording more regularly on a secondary YouTube channel, \"thatistheplan\", on which he reviewed memes and recorded \"often irreverent videos that don't fall into the record review format\", according to\nSpin\n.\n[\n8\n]\nIn October 2017, an article by Ezra Marcus in\nThe Fader\naccused Fantano of promoting\nalt-right\nsentiments in videos on \"thatistheplan\". Marcus criticized Fantano for the use of\nPepe the Frog\nmemes (which had recently been labeled\nan alt-right symbol\n) and targeting\nfeminists\n.\n[\n17\n]\nAfter the article was released, multiple scheduled dates of\nThe Needle Drop\nU.S. tour were cancelled, with at least one ticket booking s",

Alvarez moved to\nTrinidad\nwhen he was two years old. His parents divorced early in his life, which proved to be difficult for Alvarez in his speedrunning endeavors, as his step-father was not supportive at first. This has since changed. Alvarez now describes his step-father as someone he can recognize as his real father and someone who has taught him in life how to be persistent and disciplined at whichever craft he wants to pursue. He always was a very strict and tough figure towards Alvarez, but Alvarez said it helped him to be the strong person he is today.\n[\n2\n]\nAlvarez is openly\ngay\n,\n[\n3\n]\nand he grew aware of the\nanti-gay culture in Trinidad and Tobago\nand felt he could not live his true life in the country. He felt more inclined to live a city life and decided to move closer to his father's side of the family in Madrid, Spain. Alvarez made the move in February 2016, just before his 21st birthday, and he currently lives with his grandmother, mother, and brother.\n[\n2\n]\nCareer\n[\nedit\n]\nCheese began streaming his\nCall of Duty\ngameplay on\nTwitch\nin 2013.\n[\n4\n]\nIn 2014, he started speedrunning and publishing videos to his first\nYouTube\nchannel.\n[\n5\n]\nHe started uploading to his main channel in 2016.\n[\n6\n]\nHe typically streams around midnight in Spain, which is peak viewing hours for the United States.\n[\n2\n]\nIn May 2017, Cheese achieved the world record time (one hour, 39 minutes, 57 seconds) in\nSuper Mario 64\n120-star category (essentially 100% completion of the game), and the first time in the category to reach under 100 minutes.\n[\n7\n]\nIn June, fellow streamer Puncayshun set the world record time, beating Cheese's world record time by eight seconds, but lost the world record the following day, after Cheese obtained a time that was 20 seconds faster than Puncayshun's time.\n[\n8\n]\nCheese was recognized by\nRed Bull\nthat month for his\nSuper Mario 64\ngameplay.\n[\n9\n]\nIn\nSuper Mario 64\n, Cheese achieved the world record time in the 70-star category in January 2018.\n[\n10\n]\nHe focuses mostly, however, on the 120-star category, where he has held the world record on many occasions throughout his career.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nIn February 2018, Cheese uploaded the first episode of his podcast with speedrunner Ryan Reeves, better known as \"Simply\", titled\nTwo Dads One Show\n, a podcast centered on speedrunning and the mentality and work ethic associated with speedrunning. The name was later changed to\nThe Two Dads Podcast\n.\n[\n13\n]\nThe following day, cheese broke the 120-star world record time for\nSuper Mario 64\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIt was later taken by speedrunner Liam in March. Later that year, he officially changed his username from cheese05 to his current username.\nCheese held the world record time in\nSuper Mario 64\n120-star category from February 28, 2022, to November 18, 2022, when it was beaten by speedrunner Weegee.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nAs of November 27, 2024, cheese is ranked 5th in the 120-star category.\nIn addition to\nSuper Mario 64\n, Cheese has also completed speedruns for\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\n,\nSuper Mario Odyssey\n, and\nCeleste\n.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nCheese is featured in the 2023 documentary film\nRunning with Speed\n, narrated by\nSummoning Salt\n.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"bc - ches05 on Twitter\"\n.\n^\na\nb\nc\n\"The life of an elite 'Super Mario 64' speedrunner\"\n.

He is the top competitive earner of the\nFIFA\nvideo game series and widely regarded as one of the greatest FIFA players in history.\n[\n2\n]\nBiography and career\n[\nedit\n]\nLapanje was born in\nCroatia\non 1 September 1992. Lapanje's family emigrated to Sweden when Lapanje was an infant due to the\nBosnian War\nand\nCroatian War of Independence\n. At age of 7 his family moved from the small village\nGödestad\nto\nBorås\n, where he has lived since. His gamertag BorasLegend is a reference to his home town\nBorås\n. He played in Swedish football club\nIF Elfsborg\nyouth academy for 8 years, but quit at age of 15. Two years later he quit his football career due to injuries.\nHe started to play\nFIFA\nat early age but got his big interest for it when he quit his football career. In his first competition in 2009 he came to the final of a big offline tournament but lost to Avan “aaviboy” Rashid.\n[\n3\n]\nSome days later he got his revenge in the unofficial Swedish Championship at Dreamhack Winter where he beat the same Avan Rashid with 3–1.\n[\n4\n]\nAfter his triumph he took a break to focus on studies and work but came back in 2012 to compete in the Swedish Championship. He managed to go all the way to the final, where he eventually lost to Filip “Stek” Persson after a nail-biting best-of-three series.\n[\n5\n]\nThe defeat was a big reverse. After the loss Ivan Lapanje decided to put full effort on Fifa and quit his job at\nHennes & Mauritz\n. In the autumn of 2012 he took home the Swedish E-Football challenge\n[\n6\n]\nafter beating Filip Persson in semi and the future rival Lukas “Lukasinho” Gummesson in the final.\nIn the beginning of\n2013\nhe attended the\nVirgin Gaming Challenge Series\nin\nLas Vegas\n. He managed to go all the way and win the world title after defeating Rafael “Ralfitita” Riobo in the final with 3–1.\n[\n7\n]\nHe also took home US$140,000, which is still to date one of the biggest single winnings in e-sport history. A month after the triumph in Las Vegas, he won the Swedish competition Metallsvenskan in Örebro after beating Lukas Gummesson in the final.\n[\n8\n]\nBut the sweetest win for the Swede was the Swedish Championship on Dreamhack Summer, where he got his revenge after previous year's final loss. He beat Lukas Gummesson in the final and claimed his second Swedish national title and the first official Swedish title.\n[\n9\n]\nThis summer he got his first sponsor signing after joining the Copenhagen Wolves.\nIvan Lapanje took part in the\nESWC\nin France for the first time in the autumn of 2013. He went to semifinal, where he lost to Frenchman Vincent “Vinch” Hoffman, who later won the competition. In the bronze placement game the Swede beat the Dutchman Alban “azzufdarra” Xhemajli.\n[\n10\n]\nIn\n2014\nIvan Lapanje joined the e-sport organiz",
