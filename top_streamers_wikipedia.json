In the Latin languages, it comes from Brunus, An Bru’, Brun, and Brugh; Bruno is a Latin name as well as Germanic (Braun) name composed of the root brun-, which can mean burnished (polished, brown,  with luste), also present in the words/names braun (in German) and brown (in English) and Bruno (in Latin.)\nToday it is also very frequent in Italy, where it has been documented since the 8th century and whose spread is mainly due to important figures such as the monk Bruno of Cologne (1030–1101), and pioneer of the scientific method, Giordano Bruno (1548–1600). \nGiven the popularity of the given name in Italy, as a result of patronymic tradition, the surname \"Bruno\" and its numerous variants are also recurrent, such as Bruce, Brunacci, Brunaldi, Brundu, Brunari, Brunella, Brunelleschi, Brunelli, Brunello, Brunengo, Bruneri, Brunese, Brunetti, Brunex, Brunetto, Bruni, Brunini, Brunoldi, Brunone, Brunotti, Brunei, etc."

The relationship is typically spatial or temporal, but prepositions express other relationships as well. As implied by the name, Spanish \"prepositions\" (like those of English) are positioned before their objects."
